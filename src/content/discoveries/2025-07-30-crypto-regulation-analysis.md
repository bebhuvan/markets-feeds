The regulatory clarity we've been waiting for is finally here, and it's more nuanced than expected. Rather than blanket restrictions, we're seeing a sophisticated framework that distinguishes between different types of crypto activities.

**Key Regulatory Distinctions:**
- **Staking services** now have clear compliance pathways
- **DeFi protocols** face new disclosure requirements
- **Institutional custody** gets streamlined approval process
- **Retail trading** maintains consumer protections

What's particularly interesting is how the framework addresses the "regulatory arbitrage" concern - there's clear coordination with international bodies to prevent jurisdiction shopping.

The market reaction has been surprisingly muted, suggesting this was largely priced in. However, I expect we'll see accelerated institutional adoption now that the regulatory uncertainty has been reduced.

**Watch for:** How traditional banks respond to the clearer custody rules. JPMorgan and Goldman have been waiting for this moment.
