This post tests automatic link preview detection for standalone URLs.

Here's some text with a regular [inline link](https://example.com) that won't get a preview.

But this standalone URL on its own line should get auto-detected:

https://www.bloomberg.com

And here's another one:

Regular text continues here. The system should detect standalone URLs and create previews for them automatically.

More content here with another standalone link:
