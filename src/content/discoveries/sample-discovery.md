Fascinating deep dive into how the Federal Reserve is approaching monetary policy in the current environment. The heterogeneous effects across different sectors are particularly striking - we're seeing divergent trends in goods vs. services inflation that suggest a more nuanced approach may be needed.

Key takeaways:
- Core services inflation remains sticky above target
- Housing costs continue to be a major driver
- Labor market data showing mixed signals
- Market expectations may need recalibration

This shift in Fed communications suggests we're entering a new phase of monetary policy where data dependency takes on even greater importance.
