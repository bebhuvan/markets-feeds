After years of waiting for AI productivity gains to show up in economic statistics, we finally have concrete evidence. The new joint study from MIT and Stanford, covering 50,000 knowledge workers across 200 companies, provides the clearest picture yet of AI's economic impact.

**Key Findings:**
- **24% average productivity increase** for AI-assisted knowledge workers
- **Largest gains in creative and analytical tasks** (35% improvement)
- **Smaller but significant gains in routine work** (12% improvement)
- **6-month learning curve** before full benefits realized

What makes this study particularly compelling is its methodology. Rather than relying on surveys or productivity proxies, researchers tracked actual output metrics: lines of code written, reports completed, customer issues resolved, etc.

**The Solow Paradox Resolution:**
This could be the moment when AI finally resolves the modern version of the Solow productivity paradox. The gains are large enough and broad enough to start showing up in aggregate statistics.

**Investment Implications:**
- Companies with high knowledge worker ratios should see sustained margin expansion
- Traditional productivity metrics may need recalibration
- The AI infrastructure build-out has stronger economic justification

**Sector Rotation Opportunity:** This data strengthens the case for AI-adjacent plays beyond the obvious semiconductor and cloud names. Think legal services, consulting, content creation - anywhere human cognitive labor is the primary input.

The study's 18-month timeline also suggests we're still in the early innings of this productivity revolution.
