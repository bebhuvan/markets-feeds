According to a report by Hart Energy, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico withheld support for the contract earlier this month, citing concerns about cost, duration, and long-term fuel dependency. In response,…",

Our analysis shows that excess mortality led to an increase in patenting activity in counties with high pre-war education levels, driven predominantly by innovations in labor-saving technologies. Our estimates imply that an additional 6,000 patents were filed in the 15 years following the war, amounting roughly to the average annual number of patents filed pre-war. We find a positive association between war-related mortality and wage growth as well as with the adoption of machines in the agricultural sector, providing additional evidence that incentives to escape labor scarcity are driving the innovation response to mortality.",

This chapter develops a framework whose goal is to survey and synthesize the answers that regional and urban economists have given to this question. Emphasis is placed on theoretical results about sufficient statistics that capture approximate impacts in both distorted and undistorted economies, as well as how new advances in data collection and causal inference are poised to leverage these theoretical results and thereby modernize and extend standard templates for infrastructure and policy evaluation. The chapter concludes with discussions of optimal policy, political economy, and practical matters of infrastructure provision.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20490",
    "summary": "Competition authorities increasingly rely on economic screening tools to identify markets where firms deviate from competitive norms. Traditional screening methods assume that collusion occurs through secret agreements. However, recent research highlights that firms can use public announcements to coordinate decisions, reducing competition while avoiding detection. We propose a novel approach to screening for collusion in public corporate statements. Using natural language processing, we analyze more than 300,000 earnings call transcripts issued worldwide between 2004 and 2022. By identifying expressions commonly associated with collusion, our method provides competition authorities with a tool to detect potentially anticompetitive behavior in public communications. Our approach can extend beyond earnings calls to other sources, such as news articles, trade press, and industry reports. Our method informed the European Commission’s 2024 unannounced inspections in the car tire sector, pr",

First, a series of theoretical approaches and results will be reviewed, before presenting major datasets and methods. As a next step, a structured analysis of key empirical findings follows. The last part of the handbook chapter is devoted to a synthesis of crucial policy lessons.",

They are then expected to agree to a further 548,000 bpd in September. At face value, it’s a logical move to…",

    "summary": "- by New Deal democratThere was no big economic news today, despite the report on durable goods, which declined -9.3% in June — after a 16.5% advance in May. Simply put, it was all about aircraft orders from Boeing. Take out transportation, and orders rose 0.6% in May and 0.2% in June. The more important core capital goods number declined -0.7% after a 2.0% increase in May. Even more fundamentally, in addition to being very noisy (see above), sometimes durable goods orders lead, and sometimes they don’t. So I don’t normally pay much attention to them.But what I do pay a lot of attention to is consumer spending, and today I want to address variations on a graph I have seen in various places in the past few weeks. Below is a graph of real retail sales, total real personal consumption, and real personal consumption on goods, all normed to 100 as of last December:It doesn’t take a genius to see that these are all trending sideways or down since then.

This is the final look at local markets in June. There were several key stories for June: • Sales NSA are down 1.5% year-over-year (YoY) through June compared to the same period in 2024, and sales last year were the lowest since 1995! The YoY comparisons will be fairly easy for the next three months, so sales in 2025 might be close to the level in 2024. • Sales SA were down or unchanged YoY for the 5th consecutive month and have been down YoY for 41 of the last 46 months. • Months-of-supply is at the highest level since 2016. • The median price is barely up YoY, and with the increases in inventory, some regional areas will see more price declines - and we might see national p",

    "summary": "by Benoit Mojon, Phurichai Rungcharoenkitkul, Dora XiaThis paper introduces a new Monetary Policy Condition Index (MCI) that integrates conventional and unconventional monetary policy tools into a unified measure. The MCI is a weighted average of short-term interest rate and central bank balance sheet size, improving upon the shadow rate by capturing balance sheet policy effects away from the effective lower bound. We estimate the MCI's weight and its dynamic relationships with output, inflation and financial conditions using a Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) framework. Results suggest that large balance sheet policies have exerted a significant accommodative influence on monetary policy conditions, including away from the effective lower bound. Through historical decomposition and counterfactual exercises, the MCI provides new insights into unconventional policy's effectiveness and unintended consequences. The framework can flexibly accommodate numerous extensions, including pos",
