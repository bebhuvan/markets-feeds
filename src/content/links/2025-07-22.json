    "summary": "Globalization offers unparalleled opportunities to expand welfare through cooperation across large networks of unrelated individuals. Social exclusion \u2013 permanent or temporary \u2013 and monetary exchange are institutions that in theory can incentivize cooperation. In an experiment, we evaluate their relative performance and interaction in anonymous networks of different sizes. Permanent social exclusion (ostracism) reduces long-run economic potential by leading to sparse networks. Monetary exchange and temporary social exclusion perform similarly well in small networks. In large networks, however, monetary exchange is the only institution that promotes full cooperation by crowding out ostracism and keeping the network complete. An insight is that monetary systems outperform social exclusion mechanisms in promoting cooperation in globalized social and economic networks.",

    "summary": "The majority of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China were privatized through ownership reforms over the last three decades. Using a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enterprises in China between 1998 and 2013, we show that privatized SOEs continue to benefit from government support relative to private enterprises. Compared to private firms that were never state-owned, privatized SOEs are favored by lower interest loans and higher government subsidies. Moreover, both SOEs and privatized SOEs significantly underperform relative to private firms, despite some improvements post-privatization. An exception is in improvements in productivity growth, where former SOEs match or exceed their private sector counterparts\u2013results consistent with recent research. We also implement staggered difference-in-differences and matching estimation to account for treatment over multiple periods and selection into privatization. The tiger can change its stripes; however, former SOEs face a mor",

We first prove that the space of Markovian randomized stopping times can be topologized as a compact absolute retract. This in turn enables us to use a powerful fixed-point theorem by Eilenberg and Montgomery to prove our existence theorem. We illustrate our results with an example of a war of attrition that admits a mixed-strategy Markov-perfect equilibrium but no pure-strategy Markov-perfect equilibrium.",

For example, economics is believed to be about money, not inequality or well-being, and this perception may attract some students to the subject, while deterring others. We report results from a UK-wide high school outreach program in which undergraduate champions delivered economics taster sessions to 5,000+ students. The sessions increase students\u2019 reported likelihood of studying economics by ~20 per cent. We shed light on what drives this increase. The sessions broaden students\u2019 understanding of what economics is about and this accounts for ~20 per cent of the increased likelihood. The sessions also change students\u2019 beliefs about (different attributes of) studying economics. The most important drivers of the increased likelihood are students\u2019 increased beliefs that they will do well in economics and that they will enjoy studying the subject.",

    "summary": "Administrative barriers to trade such as customs procedures are well-documented sources of delays and costs in cross-border commerce, often prompting firms to outsource these tasks to specialist customs agents. This paper examines the role of customs agents in a key global trade facilitation policy\u2014the Authorized Economic Operator Mutual Recognition Agreement (AEO-MRA)\u2014which enables certified traders to benefit from simplified customs procedures with partner countries. Focusing on the 2012 EU-US AEO-MRA, and using UK transaction-level customs data from HMRC that uniquely identify the AEO status of agents filing on behalf of firms, we document the widespread use of customs agents in UK exports. Guided by a theoretical framework, we show that non-certified firms benefited indirectly from the policy through certified agents, leading to more US market entry, fewer product exits, and higher export values. These findings highlight the role of intermediaries in extending the reach of trade fa",

    "summary": "Using a large and representative panel of U.S. brokerage accounts, we show that retail investors trade as contrarians after large earnings surprises, especially for loser stocks, and that such contrarian trading contributes to price momentum and post earnings announcement drift (PEAD). We show that extreme return streaks and surprises are not enough for stocks to exhibit PEAD and momentum and that the intensity of contrarian retail trading plays a key role: the PEAD of loser stocks with bad earnings surprises becomes increasingly more negative as retail buying pressure increases, and he PEAD of the stocks with the highest past returns and largest earnings surprises is the most positive for the stocks with the biggest net retail outflow. Finer sorts confirm the results, as do sorts by firm size and institutional ownership level.

    "summary": "There are four remaining FOMC meetings this year: July, September, October and December.\u00a0 It is very unlikely that the FOMC will cut rates next week, but there are very different views on the rest of 2025.First, from BofA: With the u-rate rising more gradually in our new forecast and core PCE inflation likely to reach 3% over the summer, we don't think the Fed will be able to cut rates this year.And from Goldman Sachs:Starting in September, we expect the FOMC to deliver three consecutive 25bp cuts, provided inflation expectations remain in check amidst worries about Fed independence.Currently, market participants expect rate cuts in September and December.",
