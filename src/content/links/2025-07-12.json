    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20451",
    "summary": "This paper studies the economic impact of commodity trade fragmentation. Using a novel production and trade dataset of 48 key commodities, we develop a partial equilibrium framework to identify the most vulnerable commodities to trade disruptions and assess the ensuing economic risks. Trade fragmentation can cause large price changes for many commodities, with minerals critical for the clean energy transition and selected agricultural commodities being the most vulnerable. The economic relevance of commodity trade fragmentation, measured by changes in consumer and producer surplus, varies across countries. However, offsetting effects across commodity exporting and importing countries, imply modest global surplus losses.",

    "summary": "- by New Deal democratMy “Weekly Indicators” post is up at Seeking Alpha.Despite the warning signs in some of the recent monthly data that I’ve highlighted in the past several weeks, the high frequency data this past week indicated smooth sailing, at least for now.Some of that is likely due to the 4th of July being one week ago, so some consumer data in particular rebounded. But at least one indicator - the S&P 500 making another new all-time high on Thursday - I suspect is due to absolute complacency; namely, the TACO trade. Wall Street must believe that T—-p is going to chicken out again w/r/t his new tariff announcements.In any event, clicking over and reading will as usual bring you up to the virtual moment as to the state of the economy, and reward me a little bit for collecting and organizing it for you.",
