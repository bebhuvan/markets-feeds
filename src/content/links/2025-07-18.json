    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20473",
    "summary": "Attitudes toward fiscal policy differ: \"fiscal conservatism\" and \"fiscal liberalism\" vary in their willingness to tolerate budget deficits. We challenge the view that such attitudes reflect national preferences. Instead, we offer an economic explanation based on a two-country Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian model, bringing its implicit political economy dimension to the forefront. We compute the welfare implications of alternative fiscal policies at the household level to assess the conditions under which a policy commands majority support. Whether the majority supports fiscal conservatism or liberalism depends on a country\u2019s debt level, its wealth distribution, and the nature of the economic shock.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20474",
    "summary": "Seven decades ago, Simon Kuznets put forward the hypothesis that as economies developed, national inequality would first increase and then decrease\u2014an inverted U-shape. He provided preliminary evidence for the hypothesis on the basis of the limited data available at the time, and theorized the genesis of the curve as arising from the twin forces of structural transformation of the economy and political economy pressures. Seven decades on, the Kuznets curve still has a hold on the development discourse as new data is used to test the hypothesis, new theories are elaborated to explain the evolution of inequality, and the metaphor of an inverse U-shape is extended beyond its original realm of national inequality. With this rich history and background, the time is right to examine the Kuznets curve literature broadly construed. This overview takes stock of what has been learned and highlights emerging research and policy questions.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20472",
    "summary": "Despite the formal end of Apartheid in 1994, South Africa remains one of the most unequal countries in the world. This paper investigates the mechanisms behind this persistence of inequality by developing a spatial dynastic model with heterogeneous agents, incomplete markets, and endogenous choices over education, occupation, savings, and location. Drawing on newly assembled micro-geographic data, we document a shift in inequality from being primarily across races to increasingly within the Black population, with spatial segregation \u2014 especially the legacy of Townships \u2014 playing a key role. Our model, disciplined by detailed spatial and socioeconomic data, captures the slow intergenerational convergence in education and occupational outcomes observed in post-Apartheid South Africa. It shows how inherited spatial disadvantages \u2014 through high commuting costs, disparities in school quality, and limited access to credit \u2014 continue to shape households\u2019 educational, occupational, and locatio",

Africa's young workforce, digital innovation and rich natural resources provide longer-term growth tailwinds. Unlocking these opportunities requires investment in skills, infrastructure and financial integration to boost trade and value-added.",
