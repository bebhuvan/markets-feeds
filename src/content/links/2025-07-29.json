An absence of volatility on Monday has no bearing on odds for volatility in the rest of the week.\" More simply put, you're essentially guaranteed to see more rate movement over the next 4 days simply because today saw none.

Rates are based on bonds, and econ data is a key source of inspiration for bonds. [30 year fixed 6.81%] emphasis added Tuesday: \u2022 At 9:00 AM ET, S&P/Case-Shiller House Price Index for May.

However, it is almost certain that President Trump will not reappoint Powell when Powell\u2019s term ends in May. Media reports indicate the leading candidates to replace Powell include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, former Federal Reserve Board Governor Kevin Warsh, and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. A more interesting question than who will replace Powell is why would anyone want to, since the next Fed chairman will likely face another Fed-caused meltdown. The national debt is over 37 trillion dollars and rising. Yet few in Congress are serious about cutting federal spending",
