However, it is almost certain that President Trump will not reappoint Powell when Powell\u2019s term ends in May. Media reports indicate the leading candidates to replace Powell include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, former Federal Reserve Board Governor Kevin Warsh, and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. A more interesting question than who will replace Powell is why would anyone want to, since the next Fed chairman will likely face another Fed-caused meltdown. The national debt is over 37 trillion dollars and rising. Yet few in Congress are serious about cutting federal spending",
