    "summary": "Judge Rejects Bid To Open Fed's Closed-Door Meetings On Interest Rates Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times, A federal judge in Washington has rejected an investment firm\u2019s request to force the Federal Reserve to open its closed-door monetary policy meetings to the public. U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell on July 28 denied Azoria Capital Inc.\u2019s request for an emergency order requiring the Fed to hold its upcoming interest rate deliberations in public. Azoria Capital sued last week, arguing that the central bank\u2019s decades\u2011long practice of holding Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sessions behind closed doors violates the \u201cGovernment in the Sunshine Act.\u201d That law generally requires multimember agencies to allow the public to attend their meetings, a standard Azoria claims the Fed failed to meet, subjecting the company to irreparable harm. During Monday\u2019s hearing, Howell said the Sunshine Act does not apply to the FOMC and concluded Azoria was unlikely to prevail on the merit",

Moments ago the Treasury announced that the sale of $44BN in 7Y notes priced at a high yield of 4.092%, which while up from 4.022% last month was still the second lowest since last September (when it was 3.668%). More importantly, the auction stopped 2.6bps through the 4.118% When Issued, which was the highest through going back to August 2022, and the 9th stopping through auction in the past 11.

Electric transformers aren't something most people think about unless one attached to the power lines serving their home or business is damaged, resulting in a power outage. Most of the time, power comes back on quickly, indicating that the transformers were not the problem. It takes longer to replace a transformer damaged beyond repair.

    "summary": "Union Pacific agreed to acquire\u00a0Norfolk Southern in a cash-and-stock transaction valuing the company at about $72 billion, forming a transcontinental rail behemoth in what stands to be the industry\u2019s largest deal ever. Norfolk Southern shareholders will receive one Union Pacific share and $88.82 in cash for each Norfolk share, the companies said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0Tuesday. Union Pacific will issue about 225 million shares to Norfolk Southern investors, representing 27% ownership in the combined company. The deal, which they aim to close by early 2027, implies a value of $320 a share for Norfolk. That would represent a roughly 23% premium to Norfolk Southern\u2019s stock before the first reports of a potential deal this month. The tie-up is poised to transform the North American rail market. Tony Hatch, Founder of ABH Consulting, speaks on Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney. (Source: Bloomberg)",

Under the scheme, Israel will give Gaza political and militant group Hamas a short deadline for accepting a ceasefire.

However, it is almost certain that President Trump will not reappoint Powell when Powell\u2019s term ends in May. Media reports indicate the leading candidates to replace Powell include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, former Federal Reserve Board Governor Kevin Warsh, and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. A more interesting question than who will replace Powell is why would anyone want to, since the next Fed chairman will likely face another Fed-caused meltdown. The national debt is over 37 trillion dollars and rising. Yet few in Congress are serious about cutting federal spending",
