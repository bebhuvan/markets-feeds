    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20446",
    "summary": "Public goods are meant to be universal, but they are inherently place-based. This paper systematically measures spatial access to public goods and quantifies the implications of distance to public facilities for income inequality. First, we map all schools and hospitals across Belgium. We compute the distance to facilities for each of the 20,000 neighborhoods and document large spatial inequalities in access to public facilities. Second, we find that this unequal distribution favors high-income neighborhoods: allocating public goods spending proportionally to our access index increases income inequality compared to measures based solely on disposable income. Third, we show that the positive relationship between income and access can be rationalized by a simple model of public goods allocation with an inequality-neutral social planner. Finally, we provide evidence that access is strongly correlated with educational and health outcomes, emphasizing the need to consider the place-based na",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20445",
    "summary": "We study equilibrium outcomes in a model with monetary-fiscal interaction when Ricardian Equivalence fails and argue that the latter feature has fundamental consequences. First, there is no longer any clear distinction between active and passive fiscal policies - there is always some monetary-fiscal interaction. Second, the equilibrium displays local determinacy for a much larger range of monetary and fiscal rules than in representative agent models. Third, the Taylor principle no longer applies in the sense that it is neither necessary nor sufficient for local determinacy. Fourth, when Ricardian equivalence fails and the equilibrium is locally determinate, fiscal deficits are generally inflationary, and their timing matters. These results hold both in a simple three-equation New Keynesian model and in a medium-scale setting when agents have finite planning horizons.",

This is almost entirely confined to the goods-producing sector, and in particular manufacturing and construction. That’s because the goods sector is more volatile than the services sector. The former almost always turns down before the onset of a recession, while the latter in many cases sails right through.Specifically, let me show you the last 40+ years of the absolute levels of employment in the goods-producing sector (blue) vs. services (red), broken up into three periods.First, here is 1983-2000:Here is 2000-2019:And here is the post-pandemic period:In each recession (except for COVID) since 1982, employment in the goods producing sector has turned down up to a year or more before the actual on",
