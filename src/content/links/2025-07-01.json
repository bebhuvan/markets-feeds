Exploiting unique features of the syndicated loan market for identification, we show that changes in the euro-dollar exchange rate around ECB monetary policy announcements that are orthogonal to simultaneous changes in euro-area interest rates and stock prices affect U.S. leveraged loan spreads. Specifically, in response to dollar appreciation, investors require higher compensation for risk, and borrowing costs for U.S. firms increase. These findings imply a causal link between the U.S. dollar and investors’ risk appetite.",

    "summary": "Giovanni Favara, James Graham, and Geng LiHome-related spending in categories such as furnishings, renovations, and repairs is tied to housing market activity, with significant implications for aggregate expenditure dynamics. We refer to this relationship as the home purchase channel of expenditure. Using household-level panel data we estimate that home purchases lead to sizable increases in home-related spending, but not to increases in goods and services unrelated to home purchase. These findings are robust to the use of close-control groups and placebo tests. We then build a heterogeneous household model with housing, home renovations, and home-related durables that is calibrated to match our household-level evidence. Model simulations of housing market shocks generate large fluctuations in home-related and total expenditure. We show that the home purchase channel amplifies aggregate expenditure dynamics, with home-related spending accounting for around half of total spending fluctu",

    "summary": "Israel’s June 12th attack on Iran’s nuclear and military facilities increased geopolitical risks (raising the risk of a broadening of the conflict across the region), pushed energy prices higher (and could have led to them going much higher, for example, if Iran had blocked the straits of Hormuz) with a negative impact on inflation, impacting the Fed’s ability/willingness to lower interest rates in response to weaker economic growth. While sharp increases in oil prices have been major factors in four prior recessions (1973, 1980, 1982, and 1990) Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy noted that while in 1973 one barrel of oil was responsible for $1,000 of gross domestic product, it’s now less than half that. In addition, unlike in 1973 when the US was a large net importer of energy, today we are a net exporter. According to the Fed’s FRBUS model of the US economy, a sustained $10 increase in oil prices would be expected to increase inflation by 0.4% and lower GDP by 0.4%.",
