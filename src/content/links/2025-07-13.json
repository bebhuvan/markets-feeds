    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20455",
    "summary": "We consider a privately informed sender selecting a mediated communication device to influence players\u2019 actions. In contrast to standard information design, there is no ex-ante commitment, and the communication device relies on information elicited from the informed parties. We define an informed communication equilibrium (ICE) as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium outcome of the informed mediated communication game. We show that the set of ICE is the subset of communication equilibria (CE) that yield sender payoff vectors bounded below by an equilibrium payoff vector of the silent game, under some consistent interim beliefs. The principal\u2019s ex-ante optimal CE may not be an ICE. In sender-receiver games, the set of CE payoff vectors lies in the convex hull of the set of payoff vectors above silence. Hence, if the latter set is convex, as is the case when the sender has transparent motives, the sets of CE and ICE coincide.",

    "summary": "We study the behavior of professional traders in an experiment in which, endowed with private information, they trade an asset over multiple periods. Professional traders do not produce the price bubbles observed with student subjects and aggregate private information better; bubbles also do not arise in mixed markets with traders and students trading together. Professional traders exhibit higher strategic sophistication than students as measured by their Guessing Game choices. We link strategic sophistication to trading in the financial market, and show that traders with higher levels of strategic sophistication earn higher capital gains and trading profits.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20452",
    "summary": "This paper provides econometric evidence on how exchange rates respond to tariffs. We construct a new tariff-shock database, which captures tariff-related announcements, threats and implementations by the U.S., China, the Euro Area and Canada between 2018 and 2020, and in 2025. Our shock measure accounts for both the size of tariff rates and their economic relevance. We show that exchange rates react to U.S. tariff shocks in systematically different ways depending on retaliation: the U.S. dollar (USD) appreciates if the tariff is imposed unilaterally, but depreciates if other countries retaliate. This empirical pattern resonates with the predictions of recent open-macro models with dominant currency pricing. In light of our evidence and drawing on theory, we conclude that the USD depreciation following the U.S. tariff announcement on April 2nd 2025 was not surprising. The spike in long-maturity U.S. Treasury yields was, however, more unprecedented.",

    "summary": "Government spending is large, persistent, and disproportionately allocated to a select number of firms within industries through federal procurement contracts. To identify the effects on firm outcomes, we construct government spending shocks at the firm level as the difference between realized and expected contract awards. We measure expectations by tracing the allocation of each dollar to firms back to appropriations bills and exploiting predictable agency-to-firm procurement shares. Firms receiving positive government spending shocks increase markups and profitability, outperform industry peers in the stock market, and gain market share, fostering rising industry stars.",

    "summary": "We investigate how fuel taxation reduces climate and pollution externalities by evaluating the world\u2019s largest environmental tax reform. Using spatially detailed emissions data from more than 1,000 European regions in a synthetic difference-in-differences framework, we evaluate the impact of Germany\u2019s 1999 ecological tax reform on transport-related carbon and air pollutant emissions. We document sizable aggregate reductions for all emissions, exceeding 10 percent on average per year relative to synthetic baselines. Using official damage valuations, we estimate avoided external costs of more than \u20ac100 billion, two-thirds of which stem from health benefits due to reduced air pollution. Emission reductions and associated monetized benefits are larger in lower-income regions, contrasting with a slightly regressive distribution of fuel costs. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating air quality co-benefits when evaluating the efficiency and distributional effects of fuel an",
