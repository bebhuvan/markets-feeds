    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20450",
    "summary": "We study the design of market information in competing-mechanism games. We identify a new dimension, private disclosures, whereby the principals asymmetrically inform the agents of how their mechanisms operate. We show that private disclosures have two important effects. First, they can raise a principal's payoff guarantee against her competitors' threats. Second, they can support equilibrium outcomes and payoffs that cannot be supported with standard mechanisms. These results call for a novel approach to competing mechanisms, which we develop to identify a canonical game and a canonical class of equilibria, thereby establishing a new revelation principle for this class of environments.",

    "summary": "by I\u00f1aki Aldasoro, Matteo Aquilina, Ulf Lewrick, Sang Hyuk LimStablecoins' linkages with the traditional financial system are growing, which raises policy challenges ranging from preserving financial integrity to mitigating financial stability risks. Broader use of foreign currency-denominated stablecoins could raise concerns about monetary sovereignty and, in some jurisdictions, erode the effectiveness of existing foreign exchange regulations. The principle of \"same risks, same regulation\" faces limitations in the context of stablecoins, highlighting the need for tailored regulatory approaches that address the nature and specific features of stablecoins.",

    "summary": "by Pablo Acevedo, Elias Albagli, Gonzalo Garc\u00eda-Trujillo, Mar\u00eda Antonia YungThis project uses unique Chilean administrative data to shed light on how production networks might play a key role in shaping the macroeconomic impacts of green transition policies. First, using customs and firm-to-firm transaction data that covers the universe of firms in Chile, we build the fossil fuel consumption and the direct CO2 emissions at the firm, sectoral, and aggregate levels. In line with the official national sources, the electricity generation sector is the most important contributor to aggregate CO2 emissions, followed by the manufacturing, transport, and mining sectors. Then, we study the role of input-output linkages in propagating CO2 emissions to the rest of the economy. To do so, we construct the production network and the carbon footprint at the firm level using firm-to-firm transaction data from the Chilean IRS, and we validate our results with the input-output tables approach used in th",
