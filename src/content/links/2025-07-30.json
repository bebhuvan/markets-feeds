Ferguson via RealClearInvestigations, Nowadays, it seems we can be addicted to anything \u2013 not just alcohol and drugs, but pornography, random Internet browsing, video games, and smartphones. Academic research papers have investigated a wide range of other behaviors including gambling, but also \u201cdance addiction,\u201d \u201cfishing addiction,\u201d \u201cmilk tea\u00a0addiction,\u201d and \u201ccat addiction.\u201d\u00a0One cheeky paper\u00a0used the standard medical criteria to show young people are \u201caddicted\u201d to their real-life friends. While this trend involves many factors, perhaps the single most important claim that has transformed what might be devoted or enthusiastic behavior into a presumed medical case of addiction is the presence of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Health experts and the popular press tell us that fun activities can give us \u201cdopamine hits\u201d and that overindulging can result in \u201cdopamine blowout.\u201d Indulging too much in naughty act",

We are now learning more about the person Brennan selected to head that team.\u00a0Just the News\u00a0and other outlets are revealing not just the extreme political bias of Susan Miller, but her remarkably poor handle on some key facts. The one unassailable fact that comes out of her postings is her\u00a0declaration\u00a0 that \u201c[I] am not a Trump fan.\u201d A review of Miller\u2019",
