As I wrote Friday, underneath the headlines, this was a barely positive report - with some significant negatives. Let me point out a couple of the big ones today.The headline was 147,000 jobs added, about average for the past year:So it’s all good, right? Not so fast.That 147,000 breaks down to 74,000 private jobs + 63,000 education (and 10,000 other). In the past six years, only 3 other times have public sector jobs (including education and all other government jobs) been such a large component of the total gain:And the simple reason is that education employment is highly seasonal, with layoffs in May through July, and rehiring in August through October, as shown in the below graph where the non-seasonally adjusted numbers are in light blue, the seasonally adjusted ones in dark blue - and even then, I’ve had to divide the NSA numbers by ",

The traditional approach to addressing this problem is to utilize a rolling window to adjust beta over time; however, this method does not account for the changing environment. It just increases the use of new information.A new paper, \"Conditional Betas: A Non-Standard Approach,\" attempts to find a new method to account for changing beta. It compares the quality of beta forecasts with one of the leading alternatives of windsorizing the data for beta. The overall effect of a simple machine learning approach is very positive. Results are strong and only based on past price data. This is worth further exploration. I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to see a hedge balanced trade fall apart because the beta estimate is wrong. Market neutral is no longer market neutral. This may not seem like a significant issue for long-only managers, but for a long/short portfolio, it is a substantial problem.",

    "summary": "One of the topics that has received attention in microfinance research is the discussion of what constitutes a safe asset and whether it is in short supply. During a crisis, there is an increased demand for safe assets that are information-insensitive and serve as a means to protect wealth. A simple example of a safe asset is the US Treasury bill. When there is high uncertainty, investors tend to sell risky assets and shift to safer ones. However, if there is a shortage of these safe assets, the price will be bid up, placing downward pressure on interest rates. Nevertheless, there is the assumption that the supposed safe asset will really be safe. That is, the risk or market uncertainty cannot come from the producer of the safe asset. If there is an increase in risk from the safe asset, it will lose its convenience yield, and it will no longer be uncorrelated with risky assets. In this case, there will be a demand for alternative safe assets. One alternative is gold. Gold is often unco",
