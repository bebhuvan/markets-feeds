    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20494",
    "summary": "Digital hiring tools challenge older workers accustomed to traditional job search methods. Using a large-scale RCT, we evaluate a job search training program for high-skilled older unemployed individuals focused on the use of online platforms and social networks. The program increased earnings and job stability for men, especially in jobs requiring complex matching, suggesting improved match quality, but had no positive impact on women's earnings and reduced their employment. Gender differences cannot be explained by observable characteristics or differential compliance but appear to derive from treated women's increased reservation wages and lower returns to online search tools.",
