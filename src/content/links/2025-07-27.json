Using data on portfolio stock transactions between 2016 and 2021, we show that, while all investors exhibit a significant disposition effect before 2018, i.e., a greater propensity to realize gains than losses, highly-advised investors see their bias significantly reduced afterward.

While opponents argue that these requirements pose an unnecessary barrier to entrepreneurship, proponents maintain that they protect stakeholders, in part by screening out low-quality entrepreneurship. We exploit a 2012 Norwegian reform that lowered the capital requirement from $17,000 to $5,000 to study this quantity-quality trade-off. Our setting includes detailed data on both firms and the underlying entrepreneurs, providing comprehensive proxies for entrepreneurial quality. We first show that incorporation rates double after the reform and remain elevated over time. Post-reform entrants are considerably smaller in terms of assets and revenues but do not differ in terms of growth, survival rates, profitability, productivity, or leverage. Furthermore, post-reform entrants have similar past income levels, age, and educational attainment as pre-reform e",

Firms adopt production technologies that enable them to offer jobs with varying levels of these desirable attributes. In a competitive assignment equilibrium, firms become polarized, catering to workers with extreme preferences. Firms not only reflect but also amplify the polarized preferences of the general population. Firm polarization is positively related to industry concentration. More polarized sectors exhibit higher profits, lower average wages, and a reduced labor share of value added. Sustainable investing amplifies firm polarization.",

Using granular full-population administrative data, we estimate consumption responses to interest rate changes via adjustable-rate mortgage resets and lump-sum cash windfalls from unanticipated inheritances. Combining them, we map a 1 percentage point monetary-policy rate decrease to equivalent uniform transfers of ~$1,000 per person paid over 5 years, totaling 1.3% of GDP. This estimate remains robust when accounting for heterogeneity in the cross-sectional incidence of these macro-equivalent policies. We find only modest heterogeneity in marginal propensities to consume, limiting efficiency gains from targeting transfers.",

Moreover, they can be divided in subnational, national, and global consequences. The paper ends with some advocacy of European-level policymaking rather than national policymaking.",

While investment-led growth may offer quick wins, it is efficiency, innovation, and institutional reform that will determine Ukraine\u2019s long-term economic trajectory. Drawing on rich micro-level firm data spanning 25 years, this paper uncovers deep structural distortions that have suppressed creative destruction and productivity in Ukraine. It finds that business dynamism is on the decline, alongside rising market concentration among incumbent businesses, including low productivity state owned enterprises. To inform priorities for reviving business dynamism, this study develops a model of creative destruction drawing on Acemoglu et al. (2018) and Akcigit et al. (2021). The quantitative assessment highlights that policies that discipline entrenched incumbents are the bedrock for reviving business",

    "summary": "The Spanish government pursued an aggressive, decades-long, autarkic policy that effectively banned automobile imports in most of Spain between 1939 and 1986. We take advantage of the Canary Islands\u2019 unique institutional fiscal regime to evaluate the effect of this autarkic industrial policy on domestic sales of automobiles produced in Spain. The archipelago\u2019s centuries old free-port regime allowed Canarian islanders access to imports. This resulted in a very different composition of automobile sales in the Canary Islands relative to other Spanish regions. Canarians\u2019 loyalty to Spanish domestic brands only converged to those of the rest of Spain years after Spain joined the European Union, once the tariff differential across regions was phased-out. Our analysis using historical provincial automobile registration data shows that import restrictions are responsible for 33% of additional domestic sales in Spain between 1972 and 1986.",

We unveil the workings of this opaque industry by drawing on universal administrative business-to-business transaction data based on value-added tax links from Belgium (2002-2023). These data permit us to document the nature of consulting engagements, take-up patterns, and the effects on client firms. We document that consulting take-up is concentrated among large, high-labor-productivity firms. For TFP and profitability, we find a U-shaped pattern: both high and low performers hire consultants. New clients spend on average 3% of payroll on consulting, typically in episodic engagements lasting less than one year. Using difference-in- differences designs exploiting these sharp consulting events, we find positive effects on labor productivity of 3.6% over five years, driven by modest employment reductions alongside stable or growing revenue. Average wages rise by 2.7% with no",

    "summary": "We show that firms' nominal required returns (i.e., discount rates) are sticky with respect to expected inflation. Sticky discount rates generate distinct theoretical predictions that are broadly consistent with stylized empirical patterns: increases in expected inflation directly raise real investment; demand shocks generate investment-consumption comovement; and the sensitivity of investment to interest rates is low. Sticky discount rates imply monetary non-neutrality, even when all other prices are flexible, because of a direct link from expected inflation to investment. In the New Keynesian optimal monetary policy problem, the central bank steers long-run inflation expectations, even in response to temporary shocks.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20506",
    "summary": "This chapter explores the impacts of migrants on the culture of their destinations. Migrants often assimilate to local social norms and practices, but they also tend to maintain their own culture. Sometimes, beyond preserving their culture, they influence their new neighbors. We propose a conceptual framework to understand when migrants shape culture at their destination---and how. We identify two key conditions for influence (ideological intensity and power structure) and three channels of influence (cultural spillovers, organizational mobilization, and political leverage). We combine insights from political economy, social psychology, and evolutionary approaches to illuminate pathways of influence in historical perspective. Our review offers a new perspective on the mechanisms of cultural transmission, using illustrative cases to characterize the various ways in which migrants shape culture in their destinations.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20505",
    "summary": "We use Norwegian data on household balance sheets, housing transactions, and consumption to evaluate the impact of loan-to-value (LTV) regulation. We find that LTV caps do not only reduce leverage, but also liquidity. The negative liquidity effect is stronger for first time buyers and persistent. While average consumption remains unchanged, buyers subject to the cap reduce consumption more following income shocks, consistent with lower liquidity raising the marginal propensity to consume. This effect is concentrated in housing-related spending and is accompanied by a higher likelihood of downscaling, highlighting an unintended consequence of LTV regulation through reduced financial buffers.",

    "summary": "\"China Did Not Start The War\": Another Fiery Showdown At The UN Over Beijing-Moscow Relations The United States and China once again clashed at the United Nations during a Security Council meeting, which occurred Friday. This has been a more frequent and growing trend over the last year of grinding conflict, into the Trump administration. Acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea accused Beijing of covertly aiding Moscow's military machine, and urged China to \"stop fueling Russia\u2019s aggression\"\u00a0in Ukraine. Washington has long suspected Beijing of intentionally shipping dual civilian-military goods in order to prop up Russia's defense industrial sector. \"Beijing\u2019s claim to have implemented strong export controls on dual-use goods falls apart in the face of daily recovery of Chinese-produced components in the drones, weapons, and vehicles that Russia uses against Ukraine,\" Ambassador\u00a0Shea said. Beijing firmly rejected the allegations, saying it enforces legal and strict controls over its exports,",

He sold the last of the 25 million on Wednesday and Thursday, divesting about 4.2 million shares for $954 million, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Friday.

Food and medicine air drops proved more dangerous than conventional delivery utilizing trucks crossing land routes, as in some instances large aid crates fell on make-shift homes and tents, crushing and at times injuring or killing people.

But given that at this point scores of people are dying each day from hunger, air drops are increasingly a risk everyone (or Western countries) is willing to take - even as Israel's military is still exercising a tight grip on what aid is allowed into Gaza and who distributes it.

Meanwhile, T.J.Muscaro reports for The Epoch Times that Munson Healthcare posted on social media that 11 people were being treated at a hospital in northern Michigan, and a spokeswoman further said that all 11 were stabbing victims.
