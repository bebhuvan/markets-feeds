The designation, issued by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on July 25 under counterterrorism authorities, blocks all property and interests of the group within U.S. jurisdiction, and generally prohibits Americans from engaging in transactions with it. “Today’s action further exposes the illegitimate Maduro regime’s facilitation of narco-terrorism through terrorist groups like Cartel de los Soles,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. “The Treasury Department will continue to execute on President [Donald] Trump’s pledge to",

This involves not selecting the features or predictors to be included in the model, but rather the statistical techniques that will generate the best predictions. Not all modeling approaches are the same, so knowing when to use the best techniques is an important skill. The paper \"From OLS to neural nets: Comparing regression models in systematic trading\" is not the final word on this question. Still, it does a good job of making comparisons across techniques. It does not address all the machine learning techniques, yet it does compare many of the simple techniques that most researchers may employ. The tables from the paper are nice to have handy for anyone starting out when thinking about modeling.",

    "summary": "Over the past couple of years, China has become the world’s largest importer of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), surpassing Japan as the top buyer of super-chilled gas since 2021. China’s surging LNG imports have been shaping Asian energy flows, with the country accounting for more than 40% of the continent's total LNG import growth. However, China’s dominance in LNG markets now appears in jeopardy, and we are seeing a prolonged decline in imports. According to ship-tracking data by Kpler via Bloomberg, China’s LNG imports are…",

    "summary": "We study an intervention by a brokerage firm providing advisory services to high-net- worth investors. In 2018, the firm changed the information displayed on its internal platform, so that financial advisors could no longer observe which clients’ holdings were in paper gain or loss. Using data on portfolio stock transactions between 2016 and 2021, we show that, while all investors exhibit a significant disposition effect before 2018, i.e., a greater propensity to realize gains than losses, highly-advised investors see their bias significantly reduced afterward. Our paper shows that by appropriately manipulating advisors’ information, financial firms can successfully reduce their clients’ biases.",

    "summary": "Governments have a long history of regulating entrepreneurs’ use of limited liability by mandating a minimum amount of paid-in equity. While opponents argue that these requirements pose an unnecessary barrier to entrepreneurship, proponents maintain that they protect stakeholders, in part by screening out low-quality entrepreneurship. We exploit a 2012 Norwegian reform that lowered the capital requirement from $17,000 to $5,000 to study this quantity-quality trade-off. Our setting includes detailed data on both firms and the underlying entrepreneurs, providing comprehensive proxies for entrepreneurial quality. We first show that incorporation rates double after the reform and remain elevated over time. Post-reform entrants are considerably smaller in terms of assets and revenues but do not differ in terms of growth, survival rates, profitability, productivity, or leverage. Furthermore, post-reform entrants have similar past income levels, age, and educational attainment as pre-reform e",

Sorokin’s opinion came nearly a month after the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v.

The divestitures coincide with a new report suggesting he's mulling over a potential acquisition of CNBC. According to Bloomberg data, Bezos has been on a selling spree since late June, capitalizing on Amazon's stock rebound from its April lows. So far, the sales have generated $5.7 billion for the billionaire. Here's more from the Bloomberg report: The sales, which began when Bezos unloaded $737 million around his weekend nuptials in Venice, were part of a trading plan for up to 25 million shares that he adopted earlier this year. He sold the last of the 25 million on Wednesday and Thursday, divesting about 4.2 million shares for $954 million, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Friday. Amid Bezos' dumping of stock under the 10b5-1 plan, a new report emerged last week from The New York Pos",

A Chinese hydrology expert has described the project as outright illegal, pointing out that it violates multiple international agreements and China’s environmental laws. The estimated $167 billion project, formally known as the Motuo Hydropower Station, is situated on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. It is set to become the world’s largest hydroelectric dam, with a projected annual output of 300 billion kilowatt-hours.

The pact comes less than a week before a Friday deadline for President Donald Trump’s higher tariffs to take effect on August 1. The president in May threatened to impose a 50% duty on nearly all EU goods, adding pressure that accelerated negotiations, before lowering that to 30%.

President Trump’s signature piece of legislation allocated $3.3 billion to the DOJ, some of which will go toward the Byrne-JAG Grant Program, a federal initiative created in 2005 which provides support for local law enforcement and criminal justice efforts. To access the new funds, which supplement the $499 million already appropriated for the Byrne-JAG program in 2025, localities must comply with a section of federal immigration law that forbids them from restricting communication between their law enforcement entities and the Department of Homeland Security regarding an individual’s immigration status.

    "summary": "UK's Starmer Organizing Renewed Food Air Drops Over Starving Gaza Efforts of Western and some Mideast regional countries like Jordan to alleviate famine in Gaza largely failed during initial airdrops over the Strip which occurred in 2024. Food and medicine air drops proved more dangerous than conventional delivery utilizing trucks crossing land routes, as in some instances large aid crates fell on make-shift homes and tents, crushing and at times injuring or killing people. There were also instances of drowning as aid was dropped into the sea during the 2024 efforts. For example a single day in March of last year saw 18 people die trying to desperately access the aid. But given that at this point scores of people are dying each day from hunger, air drops are increasingly a risk everyone (or Western countries) is willing to take - even as Israel's military is still exercising a tight grip on what aid is allowed into Gaza and who distributes it.

The local sheriff’s office is investigating the attack and details are limited, but Michigan State Police confirmed that a suspect was in custody. Meanwhile, T.J.Muscaro reports for The Epoch Times that Munson Healthcare posted on social media that 11 people were being treated at a hospital in northern Michigan, and a spokeswoman further said that all 11 were stabbing victims. Spokesperson Megan Brown said late Saturday that six were in critical condition and five were in serious condition. The Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office later said in a statement on social media that the suspect was a 42-year-old man who entered the store around 4:45 p.m. A sheriff’s deputy arrived within minutes of the suspect drawing his knife. He was taken into custody, and people in the store also helped apprehend the suspect and treat victims, ",

On early Tuesday morning, German police searched an older warehouse where Bystron conducted business a decade ago. “This is targeted terror against the opposition,” Bystron said in a press release. “There is no other way to classify the absurd behavior of the authorities.” Bystron was the target of Czech intelligence services last year, who decided to release a variety of allegations surrounding their investigation at a rather opportune time—right before EU parliamentary elections.

    "summary": "Most analysts expect no change to FOMC policy at the meeting this week, keeping the target range at 4 1/4 to 4 1/2 percent.    Market participants currently expect the FOMC to cut the Fed Funds rate 25bp in September, with a second rate cut in December.From BofA: We do not expect any policy changes at the July Fed meeting. Most FOMC participants likely view this meeting as a placeholder. The balance of risks remains the same as in June: to the upside on inflation and to the downside on the labor market. The Fed will have a lot more information on how these risks have evolved by the September meeting. ... August’s Jackson Hole Symposium further reduces the urgency to guide markets next week. The Fed will have an additional month’s worth of data by then. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that Powell used his Jackson Hole speech last year to signal the 50bp cut in September. This year, Powell will most likely be speaking on the morning of August 22. Although the focus will be on ",

The Istanbul-hosted meeting lasted about four hours and marks the first such engagement since Israel's mid-June strikes on Iran, which triggered a 12-day conflict, at the end of which the US intervened on Israel's side and bombed three key nuclear facilities.
