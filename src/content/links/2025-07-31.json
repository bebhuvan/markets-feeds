    "summary": "Apple Inc. reported third-quarter revenue that handily topped analysts’ estimates, boosted by surprisingly strong sales of the iPhone and products in China. Revenue rose 9.6% to $94 billion in the period, which ended June 28, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts estimated $89.3 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple had projected a $900 million headwind from tariffs during the period, saying that revenue would grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Though US tariffs are still expected to weigh on results in the long run, they likely provided a boon to Apple in the latest period — with consumers rushing to stores to get out ahead of expected price increases. The company also has been staging a comeback in China, a market where local phone brands have made inroads with consumers.

Source: BEA, Atlanta Fed, Bloomberg, and author’s calculations. While the CEA might be buoyed by the 3% which exceeded consensus, it’s clear that 3% did not put GDP on its pre-Trump trajectory. Interestingly, on the day before the release, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow was essentially on target at 2.9% vs actual 3.0% y/y annualized (4 days before release, it was at then-consensus of 2.4%). Given the distortions in GDP associated with tariff frontloading, I think these are times when it’s particularly useful to use final sales to private domestic purchasers (aka “Core GDP”) as a proxy",

Lawson Mansell describes the problem and offers some solutions in “Health Care Abundance: A Supply-Side Agenda” (Milken Institute Review, Third Quarter 2025, pp. 36-47). To illustrate the problem, consider the category of “treatable deaths,” a statistic compiled by reseachers at the OECD. The idea is to leave out all deaths that happen over the age of 75, and focuses only on deaths from causes that could have been treated” with more effective and timely healthcare interventions. To be clear, this is a separate category from “preventable” deaths. The OECD writes: The main treatable cause of mortality in 2021 was circulatory diseases (mainly heart attack and stroke), which accounted for 37% of premature deaths amenable to treatment.
