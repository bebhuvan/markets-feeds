Despite visiting over 50 countries, I'd never actually done an organized tour, as I've always preferred to travel independently.Although I had a mostly great experience, I can't say I'll be booking organized tours of other destinations anytime soon",

    "summary": "Here is a graph of the year-over-year change in shelter from the CPI report and housing from the PCE report this morning, both through June 2025. CPI Shelter was up 3.8% year-over-year in June, down from 3.9% in May, and down from the cycle peak of 8.2% in March 2023.Housing (PCE) was up 4.1% YoY in June, unchanged from 4.1% in May and down from the cycle peak of 8.3% in April 2023. Since asking rents are mostly flat year-over-year, these measures will slowly continue to decline over the next year as rents for existing tenants continue to increase. The second graph shows PCE prices, Core PCE prices and Core ex-housing over the last 3 months (annualized): Key measures are above the Fed's target on a 3-month basis. 3-month annualized change: PCE Price Index: 2.5% Core PCE Prices: 2.6% Core minus Housing: 2.4%",
