    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20462",
    "summary": "Using a short- and long-term macroeconomic forecasts, we estimate the cost of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine for countries in Eastern Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia. Shortly after the Russian attack, the projected cost (cumulative over six years) stood at $2.44 trillion for the region. Professional forecasters predicted a dramatic increase in macroeconomic uncertainty, significant spillover effects, some hysteresis effects as well as a changing nature of business cycles. We also use the war shock to study how professional forecasters acquire and process information. Our results point to state dependence as well as an important role of forward information in shaping macroeconomic outlook of professional forecasters.",

    "summary": "This review article synthesizes the current literature on online community platforms, emphasizing their unique governance challenges and the implications for platform management and research. Unlike conventional multi-sided platforms, online communities rely heavily on voluntary contributions, decentralized coordination, and socioemotional incentives. Governance in these communities is often based on self-regulation, peer moderation, and informal norms, although formal roles and rules increasingly emerge as communities grow. The article explores mechanisms such as information seeding, signaling, contests, and reputation-based incentives to guide contributor behavior without compromising autonomy. Despite a rich body of research, several promising avenues remain underexplored. These include understanding the evolution of production and governance functions in decentralized settings, the interplay between cross-community participation, the impact of communication channel multiplicity, an",

But on the other, we are waiting for the effects of Tariff-palooza! In June the waning post-pandemic effects continued to dominate, as the only items still rising at a rate in excess of 4% were Owners’ Equivalent Rent, gas and electric utility services, and motor vehicle insurance and repairs, joined by hospital services, meat and tobacco.Here’s the more detailed look. Headline CPI in June rose 0.3%, core CPI rose 0.1%, and ex-shelter CPI was unchanged. On a YoY basis, CPI rose 2.4%, core CPI rose 2.8%, and CPI ex-shelter CPI rose 0.3%. Here is the month over month look at all three:On a YoY basis, headline CPI was up 2.7%, core CPI up 2.9%, and CPI ex-shelter was up 2.0%:This graph does suggest that CPI is at an inflection point. While the YoY trend in core inflation appears to be a continuation of slight deceleration (alt",

I first noticed it at the airport. A line 20 people deep for the American Express lounge. Then, once you get inside, more lines for food/drinks and not an open chair in sight. Then I saw it in the housing market. I have friends with $10,000+ monthly mortgage payments on modest homes. Ten grand a month and they still don't own a mansion. Today, buying a 3-bedroom apartment in Jersey City (where I live) would cost me anywhere from $9,300-$14,000 a month (all-in). I could rent the same unit for around $6,000-$7,000 a month. Lastly, I saw it when I went on vacation to the Bahamas. I was told that Baha Mar was the place to go. It's an expensive resort that has a waterpark, casino, and lots of dining options. The only problem? There isn't enough space for everyone to enjoy everything. If you don't book ahead, good luck getting a reservation at",
