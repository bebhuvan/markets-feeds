    "url": "https://www.nber.org/papers/w34082#fromrss",
    "summary": "This paper examines a new moral hazard in delegated decision-making: authors can embed hidden instructions—known as prompt injections—to bias AI referees in academic peer review, thereby hijacking machine recommendations. Because AI reviews are relatively inexpensive compared to manual assessments, referees would otherwise delegate fully, which undermines quality. The paper shows that moderate detection of manipulation can paradoxically improve welfare. With intermediate detection probabilities, only low-quality authors undertake manipulation, and detection becomes informative about quality, inducing referees to mix between manual and AI reviews. This partially separating equilibrium preserves the value of peer review when AI quality is intermediate. When detection is too low, all bad papers are manipulated and the market unravels; when detection is perfect, referees use only AI and acceptance collapses. Thus, some prompt injection must be tolerated to sustain the market: it discipline",

    "summary": "We assemble global, spatially disaggregated panel data on ambient particulates, population, and economic activity, and develop a macroeconomic integrated assessment model of particulate exposure for 30 countries representing 60\\% of world population. The data indicate the importance of country level factors in determining particulate exposure. Model results indicate the importance of equilibrium adjustments. For example, uncompensated oil taxes and agricultural burning restrictions may unintentionally raise exposure by shifting labor to dirtier sectors or locations. Model results also showcase the importance of country heterogeneity and fiscal management. Our results suggest that effective particulates policy requires accounting for general equilibrium responses.",

    "url": "https://www.nber.org/papers/w34080#fromrss",
    "summary": "Abstract We examine positive and normative questions that arise with the joint use of carbon taxes and green subsidies in an open economy. Moving from autarky to free trade induces countries to introduce green subsidies and reduce carbon taxes, in order to reduce foreign emissions. In contrast to the “leakage” effect of carbon taxes, green subsidies are associated with “reverse leakage,” as they decrease emissions both at home and abroad, and as a consequence, the availability of green subsidies tends to be good for global welfare. International climate agreements (ICAs) seek to increase carbon taxes, but the effect on green subsidies is more nuanced. An ICA removes green subsidies, even though they exert positive international externalities at the noncooperative equilibrium. If, however, policies can only be changed gradually, an ICA may start by increasing subsidies before decreasing them over time. We also consider the welfare implications of lobbying from the fossil and green energ",

    "summary": "Renewable electricity generation technology costs have fallen dramatically, investment has grown rapidly, and renewables are now a pillar of climate and decarbonization policy. Part of the credit for these trends goes to environmental policy efforts to support renewable energy as a substitute to fossil energy. The recent rise in protectionism, industrial policy, and geopolitical tensions has the potential to either undermine or enhance these environmental policy objectives. In this paper, we provide an overview of renewable energy economics and policy, with a focus on solar and wind power. We outline theoretical rationales for industrial policy and review recent empirical research, paying particular attention to how renewable energy policies have generated spillovers across firms and countries. We close by highlighting how this recent evidence can inform ongoing industrial policy debates.",

Endowment use varies systematically across sectors and revenue models. Organizations with endowments scale mission-related spending more effectively and hedge revenue risk through asset allocation. Yet most endowments underperform passive benchmarks, with the weakest performance concentrated among smaller, self-managed funds. Advisory fees are positively correlated with gross returns but negatively with net returns, suggesting overpayment for investment services. Stronger governance, lower discretionary spending, and the use of outsourced CIOs are associated with better performance.",

    "summary": "Culture’s influence on economic outcomes is no longer controversial among economists even if it remains largely ignored in many areas of economics. This paper tackles a different question: why does culture change? The underlying premise adopted here is that culture changes because incentives change, transforming actions and beliefs. An idiosyncratic review of the literature follows that illustrates how the environment (e.g., the prevalence of pathogens or the suitability of land for pastoralism) and historical experiences (e.g., colonization, war, or migration) can affect relationships of power in society and shape people’s beliefs. It then examines the role of new information and ideas (i.e., learning) and finally the role of policies in shaping incentives and changing culture. A second part of the paper reviews work that models the mechanisms of cultural change more explicitly, using quantitative models to examine the interplay between economic incentives and evolving beliefs or pref",

    "summary": "This paper presents micro-empirical evidence on the effects of wage-setting decentralization. Our setting is Italy, where employers are required to comply with occupation- and industry-specific wage floors set by national collective bargaining agreements. We show that opting out of these agreements reduces wages but increases workers’ employment and retention within firms. These effects are most pronounced in the more productive North, where the overall impact on workers’ earnings is slightly positive. In contrast, in the South, wage losses outweigh employment gains, leading to a net decline in earnings. We also find that increased wage-setting flexibility is associated with higher firm survival rates in both regions. The regional divergence in outcomes aligns with a monopsony framework in which productivity and labor supply elasticities vary spatially.",

    "summary": "How do regional productivity shocks or transportation infrastructure improvements affect aggregate welfare? In a general class of spatial equilibrium models, we provide a formula for aggregate welfare changes, decomposed into terms associated with (i) technology (Fogel 1964, Hulten 1978), (ii) spatial dispersion of marginal utility, (iii) fiscal externalities, (iv) technological externalities, and (v) redistribution. We further use this decomposition to derive a general formula for optimal spatial transfers and show that, whenever optimal transfers are in place, the technology term alone captures the aggregate welfare effects of technological shocks. We apply our framework to study welfare gains from improving the US highway network. We find that changes in the spatial dispersion of marginal utility are as important as technological externalities in accounting for the deviations from the Fogel-Hulten benchmark to assess welfare gains.",

    "summary": "A central challenge in the climate crisis is how to mobilize collective action—and who can do it. We show that digital platforms can transform latent support for sustainability into measurable environmental outcomes, while also generating value for the platform itself. We study Ant Forest, a program embedded in Alipay, China’s leading fintech app, which rewards users’ low-carbon behaviors with game points redeemable for planting real trees in arid regions of the country. Since its launch in 2016, the program has engaged over 700 million users and funded the planting of 500 million trees. Using user-level data, we find that participation is significantly higher in cities that have experienced faster vegetation growth. We propose a “green experience” mechanism: visible environmental improvement fosters greater appreciation for nature and increases support for sustainability efforts elsewhere. Survey evidence supports this mechanism, with participants also citing gamification and warm glo",

We unveil the workings of this opaque industry by drawing on universal administrative business-to-business transaction data based on value-added tax links from Belgium (2002-2023). These data permit us to document the nature of consulting engagements, take-up patterns, and the effects on client firms. We document that consulting take-up is concentrated among large, high-labor-productivity firms. For TFP and profitability, we find a U-shaped pattern: both high and low performers hire consultants. New clients spend on average 3% of payroll on consulting, typically in episodic engagements lasting less than one year. Using difference-in-differences designs exploiting these sharp consulting events, we find positive effects on labor productivity of 3.6% over five years, driven by modest employment reductions alongside stable or growing revenue. Average wages rise by 2.7% with no ",

    "summary": "Between the early 1990s and 2015 the relationship between mental despair and age was hump-shaped in the United States: it rose to middle-age, then declined later in life. That relationship has now changed: mental despair declines monotonically with age due to a rise in despair among the young. However, the relationship between age and mental despair differs by labor market status. The hump-shape in age still exists for those who are unable to work and the unemployed. The relation between mental despair and age is broadly flat, and has remained so, for homemakers, students and the retired. The change in the age-despair profile over time is due to increasing despair among young workers. Whilst the relationship between mental despair and age has always been downward sloping among workers, this relationship has become more pronounced due to a rise in mental despair among young workers.

The algorithmic firm can earn profits that exceed its share of collusive profits, and coercive equilibrium outcomes can be worse for consumers than collusive outcomes. In extensions, we incorporate simple learning by the rival, and we explore the implications for platform design.",

    "url": "https://www.nber.org/papers/w34068#fromrss",
    "summary": "We consider how a physical disability alters patterns of time use. A disability may raise the time cost of all activities; of some—making them differentially less worth doing; or it may make switching activities more costly. The first yields no predictions about time use, but the latter two possibilities both predict that fewer activities will be undertaken, with more time spent on each. These explanations describe our findings based on non-working ATUS 2008-22 respondents ages 70+, 32 percent of whom self-assess a disability. Data from the Polish Time Use Survey, where disability is medically certified, show similar results; and they demonstrate the same loss of variety over multiple days. Remarkably similar basic results are found using homogenized British, Canadian, French, Spanish, and Italian time-diaries. Overall, a mobility/physical disability leads an otherwise identical person to engage in over 10 percent fewer activities on a typical day. The lost variety represents extra cos",

This chapter aims to synthesize these two literatures into a unified framework for understanding multinational firms and cross-border mergers. The discussion is organized around the decision-making process of multinational firms, from choosing to operate internationally to selecting between greenfield investment and mergers. This framework reveals the theoretical and empirical evidence on the drivers of multinational production, including productivity gains, knowledge transfers, and market frictions. The findings highlight the commonality between the two literatures, but also suggests that greater integration between eco",

While the creation of Stablecoins may increase the demand for safe dollar-denominated instruments due to reserve backing requirements, they may also serve as substitutes, reducing the global demand for traditional reserve assets. We develop a multicountry model featuring the US, the rest of the world, and a distinct Digital Economy to quantify the impact of the potential expansion of the digital economy. Our results show that, in the long run, the reserve demand effect dominates the substitution effect, leading to lower US interest rates and greater US foreign borrowing. We also find that the expansion of the Digital Economy increases idiosyncratic consumption volatility in the US, while reducing it in the rest of the world.",

    "url": "https://www.nber.org/papers/w34065#fromrss",
    "summary": "Data centers are among the fastest-growing electricity consumers, raising concerns about their impact on grid operations and decarbonization goals. Their temporal flexibility—the ability to shift workloads over time—offers a source of demand-side flexibility. We model power systems in three U.S. regions: Mid-Atlantic, Texas, and WECC, under varying flexibility levels. We evaluate flexibility's effects on grid operations, investment, system costs, and emissions. Across all scenarios, flexible data centers reduce costs by shifting load from peak to off-peak hours, flattening net demand, and supporting renewable and baseload resources. This load shifting facilitates renewable integration while improving the utilization of existing baseload capacity. As a result, the emissions impact depends on which effect dominates. Higher renewable penetration increases the emissions-reduction potential of data center flexibility, while lower shares favor baseload generation and may raise emissions. Our",

    "url": "https://www.nber.org/papers/w34064#fromrss",
    "summary": "We characterize the causal impact of having a child with Down syndrome relative to having one without Down syndrome using event studies around birth and population-wide Swedish administrative data from 1990 to 2019. The incremental effect of having a child with Down syndrome is to increase the likelihood of parental co-habitation and subsequent child-bearing. These effects exist both in an environment with essentially no prenatal testing – where the birth of a child with Down syndrome is random conditional on maternal age – as well as once prenatal screening and testing is more common. In both contexts, total income also increases due to the presence of a generous allowance for families with a child with a disability, but the impact on labor earnings differs. In the “no-testing” environment, having a child with Down syndrome leads to a greater decrease in maternal earnings post-birth relative to having a child without Down syndrome, but this effect reverses sign once testing is availab",

    "url": "https://www.nber.org/papers/w34063#fromrss",
    "summary": "Discussion of the causes of the Great Inflation in the UK during the 1970s has centred around the relative importance of two potential explanations, which we label “bad luck” – the occurrence of unusually large commodity price and supply-side shocks - and “bad policy” reflecting failures in both monetary and prices and incomes policies. By reconsidering the historical and empirical record of inflation from 1950s to the early 1990s we show that the persistence of the Great Inflation in the UK cannot fully be explained by these factors, although these can account for some of the major fluctuations. Instead, underlying inflation and inflation expectations appear to be the result of a sequence of regime shifts. We argue those regime shifts are as much related to fundamental changes in fiscal policy as they are to monetary policy and union reforms. Our empirical evidence suggests that fiscal policy was at the heart of many of the problems in the UK during the Great Inflation. In contrast to",

    "summary": "Bank resolution preserves a failing bank's critical functions to support financial stability. Resolution tools incur costs, through either funding the bank's operations or supporting a purchase of the failing bank.

However, public resources may sometimes be needed to enhance a bank's internal resources and those of industry-sourced funds, and jurisdictions have adopted a variety of policies to deploy and recoup such public support.",
