    "fullContent": "Roblox's Child Predator Problem Just Got Weirder Via VigilantFox.com Every so often, a story comes along that‚Äôs so outrageous you can‚Äôt even fathom it being real. Yet something deeply disturbing is happening in the Roblox universe, and everyone with a pulse needs to know about it. Every month, 380 million users log into Roblox, a massively popular mobile and console game among children. The platform boasts more custom-made games from users than you could ever count, giving Roblox virtually infinite replayability. However, some of these custom games have become a magnet for child predators. A horrific example is XYZ Public Bathroom Simulator, a game where it is commonplace to see naked avatars (predators) showering with kids. That‚Äôs ‚Äúthe whole premise of the game,‚Äù according to 22-year-old Roblox YouTuber Schlep. 7.4 million users (mostly children) have been exposed to filth. And it‚Äôs still widely available for anyone to join. Schlep has been exposing how ‚Äúthere are so many predators‚Äù on the Roblox platform that ‚Äúit is actually unreal.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd parents aren‚Äôt aware of this,‚Äù he warns. ‚ÄúI get emails from kids daily about all the horrible stuff that they‚Äôre exposed to. I get emails from parents talking about what their kids were exposed to.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I were a parent‚Ä¶ I would be outraged.‚Äù .@RealSchlep has been exposing how ‚Äúthere are so many predators‚Äù on the Roblox platform that ‚Äúit is actually unreal.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd parents aren‚Äôt aware of this,‚Äù he warns. ‚ÄúI get emails from kids daily about all the horrible stuff that they‚Äôre exposed to.

Here‚Äôs one of those arrests in action.

I urge you to‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/uu50CvKrK2 ‚Äî The Vigilant Fox ü¶ä (@VigilantFox) August 14, 2025 According to IndiaTimes, Roblox accused Schlep of ‚Äúsharing or soliciting personally identifiable information.‚Äù Schlep was gobsmacked and wondered if Roblox was referring to the practice of turning over the information of predators to police. ‚ÄúLike, does Roblox understand that?‚Äù he asked. Schlep defended his actions, saying his efforts were in good faith and aligned with the ‚Äúsame tactics‚Äù used by law enforcement. Schlep has drawn overwhelming community support, with most users siding with him over Roblox. On r/games, one Redditor delivered a scathing statement on the Schlep case, receiving the most upvoted comment: ‚ÄúHistory has proven again and again [that] it‚Äôs infinitely easier for corporations to silence and censor whistleblowers than actually work on fixing whatever issue they‚Äôre bringing attention to. Roblox doesn‚Äôt have a child predator issue if no one‚Äôs able to report on it. The fact [that] his [Schlep‚Äôs] investigations led to six actual arrests made by the police acting on outside evidence is proof enough his efforts aren‚Äôt misguided.‚Äù IndiaTimes also reported that, when Schlep was younger, he was groomed by a Roblox developer‚Äîhence why he is so determined to expose child predators. His mother filed a complaint with Roblox, but ‚Äúthey brushed her off, and the predator continued abusing others for years before being banned.‚Äù Schlep was so traumatized by the experience that he even made an attempt on his life. That happened under David Baszucki‚Äôs watch, who has been Roblox‚Äôs CEO for 21 years now. He has been oddly silent on the Schlep fiasco. In March of this year, he brushed off parents‚Äô concerns about safety, saying, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not comfortable, don‚Äôt let your kids be on Roblox.‚Äù While Baszucki has been quiet, Roblox has been attempting to justify nuking Schlep‚Äôs accounts and condemning vigilante justice against child predators. But the backlash has been fierce, with Roblox even receiving a community note on their X post stating they have a ‚Äúknown history of being ineffective‚Äù at keeping their game safe from child predators. The optics have gotten so bad for Roblox that American lawmakers are now getting involved. On Wednesday, Rep. Ro Rhanna (D-CA) issued a public statement, condemning Roblox for ‚Äúnot doing enough‚Äù to protect kids from child predators.

The goal is to get a million signatures by Friday ‚Äúto push Roblox to do more to protect our children and to prosecute predators.‚Äù If you‚Äôre a parent or Roblox user, I urge you to sign Rep. Khanna‚Äôs petition and uninstall Roblox from your devices. Roblox has chosen to be a safe space for predators over children, and nothing teaches a company a lesson better than hitting them where it hurts‚Äîtheir wallets.

    "fullContent": "Wind Giant Orsted Suffers Worst Week On Record As Green Energy Demise Accelerates Wind company Orsted A/S was once the poster child of the green energy movement, debuting on European stock exchanges nine years ago. Now, with the green energy industry in shambles as common-sense energy policies return under the Trump administration, Orsted has suffered its worst weekly decline ever, trading far below its IPO price. At the beginning of the week, Orsted announced a rights offering of up to 60 billion kroner ($9.4 billion), sending shares crashing and leaving them down about 33% by week's end. Shares have fallen below their 2016 IPO price. Wall Street analysts are 71.9% \"Hold,\" 15.6% \"Sell,\" and 12.5% \"Buy\"... With wind farm construction as its core business, Orsted has been exposed to more canceled projects than any of its industry peers, including ones in the US and the UK. The funding gap swelled after scrapping a stake sale in the Sunrise Wind project off New York. Goldman analysts led by Alberto Gandolfi called the rights offering \"largely unexpected, with clarity expected by mid-September‚Ä¶ but also a clean-up move.\" Compounding problems for Orsted, S&P Global Ratings downgraded the company's long-term credit rating to BBB-, just one notch below junk status. The rating agency cited Orsted's inability to carry out project refinancing and divest 50% of its Sunrise project. At Orsted's market capitalization peak, it was once worth more than BP and flagged a 'green' success by Wall Street, politicians, and leftist climate nonprofits.

    "fullContent": "Democrats Plan Nationwide Protests Over Redistricting Authored by Chase Smith via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Democrats and allied advocacy groups are set to launch a series of protests on Saturday, Aug. 16, targeting Republican-led redistricting plans they say are designed to secure long-term control of the U.S. House. California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks at a press conference, accompanied by Texas Democratic legislators, at the governor‚Äôs mansion in Sacramento, Calif., on Aug. 8, 2025. Reuters/Carlos Barria The ‚ÄúFight the Trump Takeover‚Äù National Day of Action, organized by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Texas for All coalition, and dozens of national and state partners, will feature nearly 150 rallies in at least 34 states. Demonstrators plan to gather at state capitols, city halls, and community spaces, with the largest event to be held outside the Texas Capitol in Austin, according to organizers. The campaign began in Texas, where state House Democrats left the state earlier this month to deny a quorum and block a GOP proposal to redraw congressional districts. The Texas Senate passed the map on Aug. 12 in a 19‚Äì2 vote after most Democrats walked out of the chamber. The plan would give Republicans five additional congressional seats in the 2026 midterms. Gov. Greg Abbott has vowed to call as many special sessions as necessary to see it passed, while Democrats argue the proposal is unconstitutional and unfairly targets districts led by minority lawmakers. Republicans have defended the effort, saying the changes are legally justified and necessary to address concerns raised by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in early July. The DOJ concerns cited possible ‚Äúcoalition districts‚Äù drawn based on racial demographics, which it said could violate the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment. Texas Republicans also say Democrats have supported redistricting when it benefits them politically, and that GOP-led states should have the same opportunity to maximize partisan advantage. ‚ÄúThough this fight started in Texas, it doesn‚Äôt end here,‚Äù Drucilla Tigner, executive director of Texas for All, said in a statement emailed to The Epoch Times. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just about redistricting or one state‚Äôs politics. It‚Äôs about the future of our democracy.‚Äù California Gov. Gavin Newsom has also weighed in, with his latest message warning that if Republicans proceed with mid-decade redistricting in Texas and other states, California will consider redrawing its own congressional lines to offset GOP gains. In a letter to President Donald Trump, Newsom urged him to tell Texas Republicans to abandon the plan, calling it a ‚Äúhyper-partisan gerrymander‚Äù and an ‚Äúaffront to American democracy.‚Äù DNC Chair Ken Martin said the party has been mobilizing volunteers and resources in support of Texas Democrats, including sending more than 250,000 text messages to residents and coordinating national media outreach. ‚ÄúNow, the DNC is supporting Texas for All and state and national partners with the biggest Day of Action yet,‚Äú Martin said in the statement to The Epoch Times. ‚ÄùDemocrats will never stop fighting for all Americans‚Äô voices to be heard‚Äîin Texas and across the country.‚Äù Labor groups are also joining the effort. ‚ÄúFrom Texas to California to Illinois, the labor movement is united in resisting the Trump takeover,‚Äù Rick Levy, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, said in the statement. ‚ÄúThis is a defining battle for the future of our democracy, and working people across the country understand the urgent need to act. As this fight continues to spread nationwide, we will stand strong this Saturday‚Äîto defend our votes, protect our rights, and stop this redistricting scheme.‚Äù Organizers say the protests are part of a broader push for redistricting reform, including the creation of independent commissions and greater transparency in map-drawing.
