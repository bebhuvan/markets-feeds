    "fullContent": "Fraud Hunters: Sniffing Out Bogus Science Authored by Vince Bielski via RealClearInvestigations, Molecular biologist Mike Rossner, who has committed his life to following the science, now finds himself playing an unexpected if urgent role – exposing the fraud of his fellow scientists. Rossner is part of a network of experts that sniff out researchers who intentionally or recklessly fabricate, falsify, or plagiarize evidence. Rossner, a consultant specializing in identifying manipulated and duplicated images in journal papers – a telltale sign of deceit – has been dismayed by his findings at U.S. research centers. Scientists often have deleted the data underlying the images, making misconduct harder to prove and casting doubt on the validity of the research. “Science is about finding the truth, and an inaccurate representation of what was actually observed means that you are not representing the truth,” said Rossner, a former managing editor of The Journal of Cell Biology. “This is harmful to the progress of science and to our society that depends on it.” In recent years, research misconduct has tainted the country’s most venerable universities, including Harvard and Johns Hopkins. To date, more than 20 Nobel Prize winners have had papers retracted by the journals that published them, a move often associated with misconduct, according to Retraction Watch. The watchdog group says that retractions worldwide increased fivefold in the last decade. That a profession with noble intentions finds itself beset by a surprisingly high incidence of not just honest errors but fraud – estimated at about 1% to 2% of all research papers – is a complicated story. Experts say it reflects a breakdown in ethics by scientists under intense pressure to frequently publish to keep their jobs. This problem was highlighted by a recent article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences about the growth of clandestine “paper mills,” which exploit the “publish or perish” culture of research. The operators of mills produce low-quality and fake papers – giving authorship to scientists at a price – that are published in “predatory journals” without peer review, fueling the growth of retractions and fraud. The problem runs deeper. Lax oversight at some universities and research centers, which are required by federal agencies to police themselves and yet depend on the grants that published research brings in, allows wrongdoing to go unchecked. When fraud is suspected, the misconduct investigations that follow are shrouded in secrecy – even though much research is federally funded. Universities typically reveal nothing at all, even though federal rules clearly allow them to disclose details of cases when misconduct is found, out of fear of defamation suits from scientists and internal employment policies. What’s more, institutions as well as the federal funding agencies that oversee the investigations, mainly the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Research Integrity, don’t disclose anonymous data on the total number of allegations, investigations, and findings of misconduct each year. This lack of transparency makes it almost impossible to determine if the problem is getting better or worse. It’s a big black box. Still, two research integrity officers (RIOs) who handle these probes told RealClearInvestigations that misconduct findings at some institutions are on the rise, stemming from an increase in the volume of substandard papers and greater scrutiny of them. “We have had more findings of misconduct at Northwestern in recent years than we did 10 years ago and generally it’s been on the rise,” Lauran Qualkenbush, research integrity officer at the top ranked university, told RCI. “There is greater public awareness and more people actually reporting misconduct.” More than academic reputations are at stake. Many misconduct cases are concentrated in biomedical research, which clinicians depend on to make diagnostic and treatment decisions. Among the examples of fraudulent research potentially harming patients, a study by JAMA found such a link with hydroxyethyl starch, which is used to treat people experiencing a rapid loss of blood. The harm is also to science itself at a time of deepening public skepticism in the enterprise. When solid findings on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines are rejected by officials in the Trump administration, which is also aiming to cut funding by about a quarter in its campaign against “woke” research, self-inflicted cheating scandals can only weaken public support for the value of science. Obstacles to Investigations Research integrity officers on the frontlines face institutional obstacles that go well beyond the deletion of data. In the university hierarchy, these investigators are known to be dedicated but are also often low-ranking. They depend on their bosses, typically a university’s head of research or chief academic officer, to run interference for them. “It’s important that RIOs have support of the most senior people because of the things that they have to deal with,” said Northwestern’s Qualkenbush. What RIOs often confront are tenured scientists with impressive reputations and institutional backing because of the funding and publicity they attract to the university. Since a misconduct finding can lead to dismissal or a years-long ban on federal funding, it’s not surprising that more scientists are filing defamation suits to “silence the critics” and derail investigations, according to a Cambridge University Press article. These investigations are unfolding in a conflicted atmosphere. Misconduct is often first suspected by researchers in the same lab where they work. Everyone in the lab, from the faculty members who run it to the younger post-docs and grad students, knows each other. They celebrate breakthroughs and birthdays together. So researchers are very reluctant to report evidence of fraud because of a fear of career-harming retaliation from their colleagues. At Northwestern, Qualkenbush goes to great lengths to protect whistleblowers and get their cooperation. She has helped find them positions in other labs, creating a safe distance from their former colleagues before informing the accused of an inquiry. She has arranged for the writing of letters of recommendation from faculty members who are not involved in the wrongdoing. One Northwestern graduate student waited a year to report allegations – until immediately after the person was awarded a Ph.D. and could move on to a new opportunity without fear of reprisal. “Fear of retaliation is a huge problem that RIOs have to deal with on a regular basis,” Qualkenbush said. “You can’t have a grad student make allegations against their principal investigator and go back to work in the lab the next day. When the accuser is in a vulnerable position, it’s just horrific.” Stefan Franzen, a whistleblower at North Carolina State University whose long saga was chronicled by the local media, became the target of an unrelenting retaliation campaign. Franzen told RCI that his troubles began when, at the urging of his dean of research, he started working with two researchers who had just published what was considered a groundbreaking paper in the prestigious journal Science. Together, they would form a competitive team to win grants. But Franzen, then a tenured chemistry professor, and a grad student dug into the paper and found several flaws in its central finding. After informing the two researchers of his concerns and getting no response, Franzen says, he intended to send a correction to the journal. But the researchers objected, saying the data wasn’t his to correct – an argument that Franzen found preposterous – and the dean sided with the duo, saying the university could be sued. Undaunted, Franzen did file a complaint with N.C. State’s research integrity officer. The RIO investigated the matter and sent a report to the National Science Foundation that oversaw the case because it had provided the grant. “The next thing I know, everyone, top to bottom, is upset with me because I’m going to cost the university money,” Franzen said. “The dean went around telling people how terrible I was. If you’re the whistleblower, you are the one who gets hurt.” Franzen says research center directors made it difficult for him to use their equipment. Worse, the dean backed an investigation accusing Franzen of grant fraud, which included a visit by two armed federal agents. Franzen was cleared. It took a decade before Franzen won a bitter-sweet victory. In a 2015 letter of reprimand, NSF banned the two researchers from receiving more federal funding because of a “misrepresentation of data on which a conclusion was based.” N.C. State, for its part, tried to distance itself from the controversy, saying the reprimand didn’t target the university and not much more. A year later, Science retracted the paper. “I went through a really tough patch,” Franzen said. “My own administration was doing everything it could to get me to leave, but yes, I’ve recovered.” N.C. State did not respond to a request for comment. Harvard, Stanford and Dana-Farber While Franzen’s case may be extreme, university leaders have more subtle ways to slow walk and obstruct inquiries to protect the reputations of scientists and their institutions. Under federal rules, an allegation of misconduct must make it through two steps – an initial assessment to weed out frivolous accusations and next an inquiry to find out if there’s evidence of wrongdoing – before a full investigation begins. As part of the process, a small committee of about three researchers and experts is set up, typically by a high-ranking administrator if not the RIO, to guide the investigation. While committee members are supposed to be free of conflicts of interest with the accused and the accuser, that doesn’t mean they always conduct a thorough and honest probe, according to one experienced RIO who asked not to be named. Some committee members struggle to take a tough stand against a fellow researcher, the source said. Others are unwilling to invest the considerable time required over a year or more, including interviewing everyone in a lab, examining up to 30 drafts of a paper, and reviewing hundreds of emails to determine who committed the falsification and whether it was intentional. The hardest part of the investigation, the source said, is to pin the wrongdoing on the lab directors. Junior researchers do most of the work on the experiments and papers, leaving their fingerprints on everything. The directors often claim they were unaware of the falsification, but it’s difficult to determine if this is true or if their lax supervision allowed the wrongdoing to occur. It’s easier for investigative committees to find that the falsification was human error, recommend that a correction be printed, and close the probe. “I’ve had cases where someone in-house told me, ‘We don’t want to make a big deal of this,’” the source said. “And I say, ‘This is a big deal. These are serious allegations against a prominent researcher.’” Science Sleuths Find Evidence of Misconduct When leaders of an institution are accused of misconduct, the conflicts of interest are so significant that independent experts should be called in to investigate, according to an article co-authored by Lisa Rasmussen, a professor who studies research ethics and has served on investigative committees at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Stanford and Harvard did turn to outsiders to investigate their presidents, but the prestigious Dana-Farber Cancer Institute kept its recent review of CEO Laurie Glimcher and other leaders in-house. Last year, Glimcher and other Dana-Farber researchers had their names on an embarrassing wave of 31 corrected and six retracted papers. Science retracted a paper co-authored by Glimcher, citing discrepancies in the data and a lack of confidence in the findings. Although the media reported that a committee of trustees would make a final determination on Glimcher, a spokesperson told RCI that she couldn’t even confirm if Dana-Farber conducted an investigation or any other details, citing federal confidentiality rules. But experts say those rules don’t apply once the investigation and findings are complete. “It would have been better for Dana-Farber to bring in an outside panel of experts to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest,” said Professor Rasmussen. “It would also be in the public interest and probably in Dana-Farber’s interest to be transparent in such a high-profile case to restore trust.” Most misconduct would probably remain uncovered or quiet in-house affairs if not for the exposés by independent investigators such as Sholto David, who first revealed the erroneous papers at Dana-Farber. A biologist with an irreverent style, David, along with dozens of other scientists, is part of an informal network of sleuths who scrutinize thousands of published papers annually and frequently find fabricated and manipulated evidence. Their detailed examinations, typically published online in PubPeer, provide the initial evidence that often leads to retractions and misconduct investigations. The sleuths have become so prolific that their revelations can overwhelm the ability of universities to investigate them, according to an article in PubMed. Retraction Watch, co-founded by medical doctor and science editor Ivan Oransky, is a key player in the sleuthing world, providing groundbreaking reports on retractions and misconduct cases. Its long-term tracking of retractions, which journals typically announce in a brief notice, provides a roundabout method of monitoring trends in misconduct, since researchers have found that about two-thirds of retractions are due to wrongdoing rather than human error. The number of retractions is climbing fast. Retraction Watch counted 139 total retractions globally in 2005, soaring to 1,542 a decade later. That number spiked more than eightfold to 13,107 by 2023 – due to a flood of retractions by Hindawi journals. Last year’s figure of 5,475 continues the general upward trend. In all, Oransky says, about 1 in 500 or 0.2% of papers are retracted. But sleuths and whistleblowers can’t possibly identify all the papers that deserve to be pulled. He estimates that the percentage should be about 1 in 50, or 2%. That figure lines up with several studies of potential misconduct. When Rossner was at The Journal of Cell Biology, he found that about 1% of accepted papers contained evidence of image manipulation and thus likely wrongdoing. Scientist and sleuth Elizabeth Bik reviewed a sample of more than 20,000 papers in 40 journals, finding that about 2% had “features suggestive of deliberate manipulation.” If anywhere near 2% of research papers are the product of wrongdoing, that’s a significant problem. Among the proposed reforms, Rossner says research institutions and journals should require the screening of papers for image manipulation before publication to catch misconduct. The publisher Springer Nature says it screens accepted life science manuscripts for Nature and its research journals. Oransky wants more transparency by requiring universities to release their investigative reports to shed light on strategies to curb fraud. Professor Rasmussen sees the need for an independent national commission, separate from federal funding agencies, to set policy, closely monitor investigations, and gather data on misconduct. “We can tweak regulations and make investigators more rigorous, but this is fundamentally an ethical issue,” said Mark Barnes, a lawyer and prominent expert on misconduct investigations. “Institutions need to be proactive and deal with this issue on the front end by training young researchers in ethics to curb misconduct before it happens.” Tyler Durden Thu, 08/14/2025 - 12:50",

    "fullContent": "Russiagate Redux: Can't Keep A Good Hoax Down Authored by Frank Miele via RealClearPolitics, When intelligence czar Tulsi Gabbard released her report last month accusing major players in the Obama administration of fabricating the Russia collusion hoax used to tarnish Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and beyond, some of us were not surprised. Nor were we surprised that the news media has either ignored the story or tried to discredit it. We are very familiar with that playbook, having seen major media outlets use it to perfection when 51 intelligence officials signed a letter falsely claiming that Hunter Biden’s incriminating laptop had “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” That letter, signed by former CIA director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James Clapper, probably cost Donald Trump the 2020 election, just as the Russiagate hoax was intended to derail Trump in 2016. The New York Times, ferociously guarding its fake Pulitzer Prize from 2018, has led the way in trying to convince Americans that the evidence released by Gabbard was manufactured by Russia. But isn’t that the same tune whistled by Clapper and Brennan five years ago regarding the laptop? Anyone who believes either the CIA or the New York Times at this point either hasn’t been paying attention or is impervious to new information. I won’t try to cover all the obvious ways in which the evidence points to a massive conspiracy to defame Trump and defraud the public. You can learn about it in the reporting by Michael Shellenberger and Matt Taibbi among others – including several reporters who write for RealClearInvestigations. And with any luck, the originators of the Russia hoax will be brought to justice. We learned last week that Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered a grand jury probe to investigate the culpability of Brennan, Clapper, former FBI director James Comey, and possibly even Hillary Clinton for their roles in what Gabbard called a “treasonous conspiracy” to interfere with the 2016 election and subsequently to undermine the first Trump administration. That could take care of half the problem, but what about the other half of the conspiracy: the media allies who promoted the Russia Collusion Hoax without doing any reporting of their own other than swallowing hook, line, and sinker the fake news promoted by Clinton and the intelligence community because of their own hatred of Donald Trump? That part of the conspiracy is still alive and well. Witness the NBC report I linked above on the grand jury probe. While it purports to be a straight news story about the possibility of charges against the purveyors of the Russia hoax, it reads more like a defense brief to clear them of criminal wrongdoing, starting with a subhead that says, “Past probes, including two conducted by Republicans, found no such crimes.” After announcing the probe in the first two paragraphs, most of the rest of the story throws shade on it: — “A former senior national security official pointed out that multiple past reviews, including ones conducted by Republicans, found no such crimes.” — “Democratic lawmakers have accused the administration of seeking to distract attention from the Jeffrey Epstein case.” — “Democrats contend that Gabbard’s talk of a treasonous Obama-era plot is patently false and a diversion.” — “A 2020 bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee review contradicted the idea that there was a conspiracy by Obama administration officials against Trump, finding significant evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election.” You get the idea. The media wants to dismiss Gabbard’s revelations about the origins of the Russia collusion hoax because most White House reporters were complicit in the hoax from the beginning. Thanks to the First Amendment, neither NBC, nor CNN, nor MSNBC, nor the New York Times will ever be held accountable in a court of law for their part in propagating the fake collusion story. And so far, it appears that the Times and the Washington Post will never even have to return the Pulitzers they won in 2018 for whitewashing the phony evidence of collusion. Nor will journalists like me ever be awarded any prizes for being right from the start. On Aug. 7, 2016, I published a column at the Daily Inter Lake in Kalispell, Montana, just days after the conspiracy is alleged to have started, wherein I cited “a political scandal … which exceeds in scope anything seen previously in our country’s 240-year history.” But it wasn’t about Trump colluding with Russians; it was about the media colluding with Democrats and the intelligence community to try to cripple the ascendant candidacy of Donald Trump. I called it “Mediagate.” The context was that Wikileaks had released emails on July 22, 2016, showing the Democratic National Committee had colluded with the Clinton campaign to sabotage the competing campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders. This story should have crippled the Clinton campaign. Instead, the legacy media unleashed a barrage of anti-Trump stories that took the spotlight off Clinton. “This was no coincidence,” I wrote, “but rather was the beginning of a concerted effort by the media to rehabilitate Hillary Clinton as the historic first woman presidential nominee in U.S. history.” As I explained at the time: People were actually starting to ask questions about Clinton’s dubious moral character and her role in the [DNC email] scandal, but since Clinton didn’t have any answers, she did what she does best and deflected the story. Instead of explaining why she had lied for months about collaborating with the DNC to steal the election, she and her surrogates led the lapdog media to instead question whether or not the supposed Russian hackers had leaked the damaging evidence against Hillary in order to boost Trump’s chances in the election. It was in this context that candidate Donald Trump held his famous press conference at the Trump National Doral Golf Club on July 27, 2016, to respond to the DNC email breach and to discount the notion that he was working with Putin. In my column, I explained that Trump had launched into a humorous stream-of-consciousness riff about how the Russians, who supposedly had hacked into the DNC server, might also have “hacked into the soft target of Hillary’s private server when she was secretary of state and therefore might have copies of the thousands of ‘private’ emails which she and her lawyers had deleted.” Trump followed up with a joke that used the Russian hacking theory about the DNC emails to take a bank shot at Hillary for her illegal email server that she used for official business as secretary of state: “I will tell you this: Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let’s see if that happens. That’ll be next.” The press went wild, claiming that Trump’s quip was proof that he had a direct line to the Kremlin and that he was ordering Putin to hack Clinton’s server. This was absurd on so many levels that it seemed more like a “Saturday Night Live” skit. Suffice it to say, no one ever explained why “Russian agent” Trump didn’t just tell Putin what to do privately instead of announcing it during a press conference. What we didn’t know at the time was that a Clinton ally named Leonard Benardo had written an email on the same day – July 27, 2016 – that claimed “HRC approved Julia’s idea about Trump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. elections” – HRC being Hillary Rodham Clinton. That email and others were concealed from the public until Gabbard declassified them last month. Of course, the New York Times and other Democrat lapdog media outlets immediately fell back on the “Russia did it” narrative to claim that the incriminating emails (like Hunter Biden’s laptop) were manufactured by Vladimir Putin and his henchmen. Fat chance. What we now know is that Trump was right all along when he called the New York Times and the Washington Post “fake news.” And I was right when I called “Mediagate” the scandal you won’t hear about on cable news. Less than two weeks after the Russian collusion hoax started, I had already exposed it as a fraud. So where do I go to get my Pulitzer? Tyler Durden Thu, 08/14/2025 - 12:44",
