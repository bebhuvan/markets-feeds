    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20476",
    "summary": "Based on an estimated two-region dynamic general equilibrium model, we show that the persistent productivity growth differential between the Euro Area (EA) and rest of the world (RoW) has been a key driver of the EA trade surplus since the launch of the Euro. A secular decline in the EA’s spending home bias and a trend decrease in relative EA import prices account for the stability of the EA real exchange rate, despite slower EA output growth. By incorporating trend shocks to growth and trade, the analysis departs from much of the open-economy macroeconomics literature which has focused on stationary disturbances. Our results highlight the relevance of non-stationary shocks for the analysis of external adjustment.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20475",
    "summary": "This paper examines the relationship between green innovation and the business cycle, revealing that while non-green innovation is procyclical, green innovation is countercyclical. This pattern holds unconditionally over the business cycle and conditional on economic shocks. Motivated by these findings, we develop a business cycle model with endogenous green and non-green innovation to explain their distinct cyclical behavior. The key mechanism operates through a ‘green is in the future’ channel: green patents are expected to generate higher profits in the future, making green patenting less sensitive to short-term economic fluctuations. In general equilibrium, this channel is reinforced, making green and non-green innovation effective substitutes. We provide direct evidence supporting the model mechanism using data on market-implied values of green and non-green patents.",
