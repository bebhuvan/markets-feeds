    "fullContent": "Congress Must Improve Science Commercialization Authored by Lars Erik Schönander via RealClearScience, Congress has an opportunity to fix federal government policies on science commercialization. Last week, House Committee on Small Business Chairman Roger Williams (R-Texas) took an important step to that end, introducing a companion bill to the INNOVATE Act, which Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced this year as Chair of the Senate Small Business Committee. Williams's bill could help reform the Small Business Innovation Research program and help nurture the next American tech giants. Congress established the SBIR program in 1982 to commercialize science and turn startups into major companies. It can tout among its success stories Qualcomm, ViaSat, AeroVironment, and Anduril, all of which used SBIR funding to grow. The INNOVATE Act would reauthorize the SBIR program, which is due to expire at the end of the fiscal year, while strengthening commercialization requirements, improving the due diligence process for SBIR awardees to minimize malign foreign influence in the program, and attracting new entrants. As part of the SBIR program’s previous reauthorization in 2022, Congress helped address serious national security flaws in the program. In 2021, the Pentagon found that multiple people receiving SBIR funding through the Department of Defense had then transferred the results of their research to Chinese academia and industry. The 2022 reauthorization addressed this problem by requiring agencies with SBIR programs to establish due diligence programs to ensure SBIR awards don’t go to companies with malign foreign ties. But other problems with the SBIR program remain, which the INNOVATE Act would solve. First, the legislation would tighten benchmarks and impose a $75 million lifetime cap on SBIR awards, which would help prevent companies from treating the SBIR program as a perpetual revenue source. The INNOVATE Act targets commercialization problems that government agencies and independent analysts have documented for years. The Government Accountability Office and outside researchers have found that a few companies receive disproportionate SBIR funding while being worse at commercialization compared to their peers. The new standards aim to redirect awards toward companies that intend to graduate from the SBIR program. Second, the bill enhances the SBIR program’s due diligence process to ensure that SBIR award winners are not connected to adversarial entities. The Senate Small Business Committee has found that companies with ties to foreign adversaries have received SBIR awards, even after the new due diligence requirements were enacted. Strengthening the due diligence process would ensure that such national security breaches don’t happen again. Third, the INNOVATE Act aims to attract new entrants and help the best companies cross the \"valley of death”— the funding gap that companies with new technologies face when transitioning research from an idea to a product. The bill would create an easier path to enter the program through a one-time SBIR award focused on commercialization and would create a transition-focused funding vehicle in DoD. These “Strategic Breakthrough Funding awards” would allow DoD to award up to $30 million to small businesses that received previous SBIR awards, but need funding to mass-produce their technology. Representative Williams’s version of the INNOVATE Act makes a few key changes to the Senate version. The commercialization language in the House version is weaker than the Senate version. The $75 million SBIR award cap remains, but the House bill creates a waiver system for companies with a national security justification to keep receiving awards. The agency director overseeing each SBIR program would approve these waivers. The House version also does not contain the language to strengthen the commercialization standards. While tracking waivers in the annual congressional SBIR report is a smart move, the Small Business Administration should also flag waived companies in the SBIR database it maintains. This would let the public and stakeholders track waiver recipients more effectively. It will make it easier to see if multiple award winners still participate in the SBIR program even after the reforms. Finally, the House version broadens the Strategic Breakthrough Funding program beyond the Pentagon. While the Senate restricts the program to DoD, the House allows any agency with an annual SBIR program budget of over $100 million to make commercialization-focused SBIR awards. This would allow agencies such as the Department of Energy or the National Institutes of Health to participate. However, the eligible activities may need expansion to cover energy and health startups' business needs, since the current language is focused on defense. With the release of a House companion to the INNOVATE Act, Congress is closer to reauthorizing the SBIR program before it expires at fiscal year's end. The SBIR program remains a powerful tool for commercializing scientific research. Congress shouldn't waste this opportunity to make the program even stronger. Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 23:20",

    "fullContent": "Canadians In Nova Scotia Now Banned From Using Public Forests Tyranny is a process of acclimation. Governments test the public to see what they will quietly tolerate; leaders then turn \"temporary\" restrictions into permanent laws as people are conditioned to accept the new normal. Sometimes the public fights back and officials are forced to retreat. However, the tests never end and the bureaucracy continues to press year after year until it gets what it wants. Many commentators have noticed that the Canadian government has been expediting this authoritarian process in recent years to the point that the intentions of elitist politicians can no longer be misunderstood. The mask is fully off and the country is becoming a draconian cesspool. From censorship laws, to gun bans, to carbon taxes and even legislation that turns Christian worship into \"hate speech\", Canada is almost every bit as cooked as their commonwealth cousins in Britain. Every few weeks it seems a new and oppressive mandate is enforced. This month, the province of Nova Scotia has abruptly banned nearly all civilian activity in public forests. It is illegal for Canadians to walk, hike, drive, camp (outside of official campgrounds) or fish in Nova Scotia's woods and anyone caught without a heavily regulated permit is subject to extreme fines. Smaller parks that have woods are also restricted. The bans will continue until October 15th unless the provincial government decides to extend. The offices for obtaining work permits have been swamped with requests and questions and citizens have been told to stop calling. At least one citizen, Canadian veteran Jeff Evely, has challenged the law and has been fined over $28,000 simply for walking into the forest. Nova Scotia just handed me a fine for $28,872.50 for walking into the woods. pic.twitter.com/sARyEzHAzR — Jeff Evely (@JeffEvely) August 9, 2025 Nova Scotia leaders have set up \"snitch lines\" that people can call to report their neighbors. According to Premier Tim Houston, the measures address the current climate with hot and extremely dry conditions increasing the risk of starting wildfires: “Most wildfires are caused by human activity, so to reduce the risk, we’re keeping people out of the woods until conditions improve. I’m asking everyone to do the right thing – don’t light that campfire, stay out of the woods and protect our people and communities...\" The average high temperature in Nova Scotia in July was a mere 73°F and little has changed in August. The province also experienced heavy rains and flash flooding last month. Keep in mind, these are public forests that the Canadian public pays exorbitant taxes to the government to maintain. The government also enforces restrictions on forest management that cause the very wildfires they say they are trying to stop. This includes a number of regulations against logging to thin overgrown woods and preventing the collection of fallen trees. As in many parts of the US, this kind of \"conservation\" turns public lands into tinderboxes in times of drought. It also suggests that preventing wildfires is not the true motive behind the bans. Critics argue that the ban is practice run for a future rollout of laws related to climate controls. The restrictions are reminiscent of the bans on outdoor activities during the pandemic lockdowns; bans that were enforced beyond all reason, logic or viral science. Numerous political leaders suggested at the time that pandemic lockdowns blocking personal travel and outdoor mobility could be extended to include \"climate lockdowns\". The scenario is also similar to globalist efforts to \"re-wild\" western countries by removing public access from certain areas and allowing \"nature to take over\" without human influence. This would, at bottom, force human beings into tighter and tighter bubbles of population that they are rarely allowed to leave. Such policies are often beta tested in smaller regions before they are expanded to include the entire nation. Legal challenges against the bans will be ample, but the overall intent behind the restrictions is suspicious and may be a warning sign of authoritarian laws to come in Canuckistan and across the western world.
