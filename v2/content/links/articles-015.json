    "fullContent": "The Era Of Online Age Checks Is Here - How Does It Work? Authored by Owen Evans via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Laws demanding internet users provide proof of age are sprouting up around the world. In the United States, at least 24 states have already passed laws requiring pornography sites to verify users’ ages, according to the Age Verification Providers Association. Illustration by The Epoch Times, Shutterstock A handful of countries, including Germany, France, Australia, and Ireland, have implemented age verification to access specified content, from social media access to pornography. At the end of July, the UK rolled out the most comprehensive national system so far. How does age verification work in practice? What are the loopholes? And how might it reshape the internet? Here’s what the experts say. How Age Checks Work in Practice Age‑verification systems range from uploading a photo of an identification such as a driver’s license to advanced biometric scans. The Age Verification Providers Association lists several approved methods for age checks, including mobile phone account verification, credit database matching, transactional records, and digital ID apps. Some platforms ask users to upload a government‑issued ID, while others rely on mobile phone account data, banking or credit records, or digital ID apps to confirm age. Increasingly, sites are turning to biometric solutions, such as facial analysis that estimates age from a selfie or a brief movement check. Reddit, for example, uses the third‑party service Persona to verify either an ID or a live selfie, while Discord relies on k‑ID, which confirms age by analyzing facial movements. X combines internal account signals with optional ID checks. Porn sites like Pornhub offer a mix of options, such as requiring a photo ID or running a credit card check before users can view sexually explicit material. The Next 24 Months Mary Ann Miller, vice president and fraud adviser at Prove, a digital identity verification platform, said that age verification will become more standard and required over the next 24 months. Miller said that simpler methods include uploading a government-issued ID that is sometimes checked for authenticity or a selfie taken to ensure identity accuracy and that the person is alive. “Other methods use solutions that leverage technology that uses the phone as a proxy for our identity since we have them with us ‘all the time’ and determine the assurance and trust of the person presenting information or attesting their age or attesting for a child’s age as part of parental consent,” she told The Epoch Times by email. The home page of Pornhub displays a suspension notice in France due to age-verification requirements, in Valence, France, on June 4, 2025. Countries worldwide, including dozens of U.S. states, have implemented age checks for access to certain websites and social media platforms. Nicolas Guyonnet/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images “Other methods include age estimation from facial recognition or other data sources.” In terms of which methods are most reliable, Miller pointed to those that “can use passive techniques to determine identity assurance first, then age verification as part of an identity flow.” Passive identity assurance techniques verify a user’s identity without requiring the user to actively perform actions—such as entering a password or scanning a fingerprint—by using data already available to infer age, including credit cards, IP addresses, or other information. Businesses in the near future will have to overhaul their age‑verification systems to meet stricter standards, rather than relying on low‑accuracy or patchwork identity checks. “What has taken many businesses by surprise is that when they try to apply age verification with low-accuracy identity checks or the absence of identity checks, they have to ‘go back to the drawing board’ on both aspects,” she said. The Push for Biometric Verification Biometric age estimation can be conducted using facial analysis. Other methods include voice blueprints, gestures, and keystrokes (how you type). These methods are currently less well-developed than facial analysis but are progressing quickly. Derek Jackson, chief operations officer and cofounder of Cyber Dive, a tech company founded with the mission of keeping children safe online, told The Epoch Times by email that facial biometrics are “newer but catching on quickly.” “They estimate your age by analyzing your facial features, cheekbones, eye spacing, skin tone, in real time,“ Jackson said. ”Voice biometrics and keystroke patterns are even newer. They try to match your unique patterns, your voice pitch, how fast or slow you type to known age profiles.” He said that facial recognition is growing quickly because “it’s simple, fast, and surprisingly effective.” A GovTech staff member demonstrates facial verification to access government services at a community center in Singapore on Oct. 1, 2020. As age-verification rules expand, some sites are using biometric tools like selfie-based age analysis in addition to government-issued IDs, bank or credit records, or digital ID apps. Martin Abbugao/AFP via Getty Images Privacy Risks and Skepticism Users remain wary about sharing personal data online, especially government IDs or biometrics. Denis Vyazovoy, chief product officer of AdGuard VPN, said that some platforms attempt to be more privacy-aware by, for example, not permanently storing selfies or ID documents or keeping data for just seven days. “But even with such reassurances, trust is low,” he told The Epoch Times by email. “Even though platforms claim that facial data or ID scans are not stored long-term, people remain wary, and rightfully so. The truth is, any method that requires biometric data, government ID, or sensitive financial information introduces serious privacy risks.” The UK’s New Law The UK’s Online Safety Act does not mandate a single method of age verification. The UK’s tech regulator Ofcom, which is in charge of policing the law, just requires companies to implement highly effective age assurances. The law focuses on keeping under‑18s out of adult spaces but does not tell companies how to achieve this goal, leaving firms to choose their own verification systems as long as they are “highly effective.” But failure to implement a system can result in financial penalties of up to 10 percent of a service’s qualifying worldwide revenue, or 18 million pounds ($23.9 million), whichever is greater. The Online Safety Act is a UK-specific law, but it affects U.S. and global companies with no legal presence in the country. Read the rest here... Tyler Durden Sat, 08/09/2025 - 08:10",

    "fullContent": "Germany Halts Arms Exports To Israel As World Reacts To Gaza Conquest Plan Netanyahu's security cabinet has approved a plan to takeover the whole of the Gaza Strip, including intense operations in Gaza city, resulting in outrage among some European capitals, who see this as doubling down on the carnage which has left over 60,000 Palestinians dead, based on Gaza health sources. Germany has announced itself as the latest European nation to suspend its arms exports to Israel, noting that these could be used in human rights violations and potential war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Berlin backs the anti-Hamas fight, however. Chancellor Friedrich Merz made clear as Israel's military is poised to take over Gaza city his government will not approve or transfer any exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza until further notice. Via Reuters Merz says it was \"increasingly difficult to understand\" how the Israeli military plan could achieve its war aims in a legitimate way, adding: \"Under these circumstances, the German government will not authorise any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice.\" The German arms industry has historically been among the globe's largest arms suppliers to Israel. Of course, the US has long been far and away the biggist supplier of arms, and under Trump this doesn't look to cease - with Germany coming in second, according to global monitors, over the last half-decade. \"Israel has the right to defend itself against the terror of Hamas,\" Merz continued in his statement. \"The release of the hostages and determined negotiations on a ceasefire are our top priority. The disarmament of Hamas is essential. Hamas must not play a role in the future of Gaza.\" But apparently Merz vehemently disagress with the practical how in terms of the methods whereby this is accomplished. Global critics have said Israel is conducting ethnic cleansing and ultimately plans to annex the strip. PM Netanyahu has sought to deflect this criticism by saying Israel will conquer the whole enclave, but that it doesn't ultimatley want to govern it. This vaguely suggests it could be handed over to an entity like the Palestinian Authority (PA) one day, but likely this would be done (or not done at all) by a future Israeli government. Shekel Falls After Cabinet Approves Plan to Seize Gaza City--Bloomberg Meanwhile other major powers like China are raising the alarm over Israel's takeover plan, with China on Friday expressing \"serious concerns\" over the move on Gaza City, urging it to \"immediately cease its dangerous actions.\" Now its getting real. Germany going beyond statements and blocking weapons exports to Israel. Source: Bundesregierunghttps://t.co/rGTCNkDLzd pic.twitter.com/J8frsDOA9R — Latika M Bourke (@latikambourke) August 8, 2025 \"Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory,\" a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told the AFP. \"The correct way to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to secure the release of hostages is an immediate ceasefire.\" “A complete resolution to the Gaza conflict hinges on a ceasefire; only then can a path to de-escalation be paved and regional security ensured,\" the Chinese government statement said. Beijing is \"willing to work together with the international community to help end the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible,\" it added. Tyler Durden Sat, 08/09/2025 - 07:35",

    "fullContent": "Trump-Brokered Armenia–Azerbaijan Peace Deal Secures US Trade Route Authored by Emel Akan via The Epoch Times, President Donald Trump will host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan on Aug. 8 at the White House to sign a joint declaration ending four decades of hostility between the two nations. The accord also launches the “Trump Route,” a new transport corridor aimed at unlocking the region’s commercial potential, the White House said. During the meeting, the two countries will sign a joint declaration formalizing the agreement and establishing the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,” or TRIPP, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told reporters during a call previewing the meeting. “By locking in this path to peace, we are unlocking the great potential of the South Caucasus region in trade, transit, and energy flows,” Kelly said. Trump will also sign bilateral agreements with both countries that “span energy, technology, economic cooperation, border security, infrastructure, and trade,” she added. The new route will be a multimodal transit corridor linking mainland Azerbaijan and its Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, enhancing regional trade routes. The new route will allow goods to be moved from not just the Caucasus but also Central Asia without transiting through Russia, Iran, or China, according to the White House. “What President Trump has done is he’s taken the politics out of the picture and made common sense prevail,” a senior White House official said during the call. “What this will do for American businesses, and frankly, for energy resources across Europe, will be enormously powerful. “The losers here are China, Russia, and Iran. The winners here are the West.” Azerbaijan has long sought a transport corridor through Armenia to connect its main territory with Nakhchivan bordering Turkey. Under the agreement to be signed on Friday, Armenia will grant the United States exclusive long-term development rights to build a route through the southern part of Armenia. The U.S. government plans to delegate the project to a consortium to handle both infrastructure and management. The official said that Trump is going to sign on Aug. 8 a directive to “set up a TRIPP negotiating team” with talks expected to start “in the middle of next week.” The official noted that since the announcement yesterday morning, they had received calls from nine potential operators, including three American companies. “We’re going to get everybody around the table. We’re going to find the most first-class operating system,” the official said. In a Truth Social post on Aug. 7, Trump announced that he'd be hosting Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan for a “Historic Peace Summit” at the White House on Friday. “These two Nations have been at War for many years, resulting in the deaths of thousands of people. Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now,” Trump said, adding that his administration has been “engaged with both sides for quite some time.” The two nations have engaged in cross-border conflicts since the late 1980s. Early this year, U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff traveled to Azerbaijan and met with Aliyev. From February through mid-April, U.S. officials expressed significant concern about the potential for renewed hostilities between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Following Witkoff’s trip, a U.S. team conducted a series of five additional visits to the region, traveling between Azerbaijan and Armenia. During the meeting, the countries will also sign a joint letter officially requesting the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or OSCE, to dissolve the “no longer relevant Minsk Group,” according to the White House. The group, co-chaired by France, Russia, and the United States, was created in 1992 to find a peaceful solution to the Nagorno–Karabakh conflict. Tyler Durden Sat, 08/09/2025 - 07:00",
