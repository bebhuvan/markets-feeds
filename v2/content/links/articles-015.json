    "fullContent": "Wind Giant Orsted Suffers Worst Week On Record As Green Energy Demise Accelerates Wind company Orsted A/S was once the poster child of the green energy movement, debuting on European stock exchanges nine years ago. Now, with the green energy industry in shambles as common-sense energy policies return under the Trump administration, Orsted has suffered its worst weekly decline ever, trading far below its IPO price. At the beginning of the week, Orsted announced a rights offering of up to 60 billion kroner ($9.4 billion), sending shares crashing and leaving them down about 33% by week's end. Shares have fallen below their 2016 IPO price. Wall Street analysts are 71.9% \"Hold,\" 15.6% \"Sell,\" and 12.5% \"Buy\"... With wind farm construction as its core business, Orsted has been exposed to more canceled projects than any of its industry peers, including ones in the US and the UK. The funding gap swelled after scrapping a stake sale in the Sunrise Wind project off New York. Goldman analysts led by Alberto Gandolfi called the rights offering \"largely unexpected, with clarity expected by mid-September… but also a clean-up move.\" Compounding problems for Orsted, S&P Global Ratings downgraded the company's long-term credit rating to BBB-, just one notch below junk status. The rating agency cited Orsted's inability to carry out project refinancing and divest 50% of its Sunrise project. At Orsted's market capitalization peak, it was once worth more than BP and flagged a 'green' success by Wall Street, politicians, and leftist climate nonprofits. Orsted's collapse in market value, credit downgrade, and capital raise mirrors the implosion of the entire green industry. We suspect that Solyndra-type failures could be on the horizon. Keep in mind, one of the Democratic Party's pillars is all things green. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 07:45",

    "fullContent": "Democrats Plan Nationwide Protests Over Redistricting Authored by Chase Smith via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Democrats and allied advocacy groups are set to launch a series of protests on Saturday, Aug. 16, targeting Republican-led redistricting plans they say are designed to secure long-term control of the U.S. House. California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks at a press conference, accompanied by Texas Democratic legislators, at the governor’s mansion in Sacramento, Calif., on Aug. 8, 2025. Reuters/Carlos Barria The “Fight the Trump Takeover” National Day of Action, organized by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Texas for All coalition, and dozens of national and state partners, will feature nearly 150 rallies in at least 34 states. Demonstrators plan to gather at state capitols, city halls, and community spaces, with the largest event to be held outside the Texas Capitol in Austin, according to organizers. The campaign began in Texas, where state House Democrats left the state earlier this month to deny a quorum and block a GOP proposal to redraw congressional districts. The Texas Senate passed the map on Aug. 12 in a 19–2 vote after most Democrats walked out of the chamber. The plan would give Republicans five additional congressional seats in the 2026 midterms. Gov. Greg Abbott has vowed to call as many special sessions as necessary to see it passed, while Democrats argue the proposal is unconstitutional and unfairly targets districts led by minority lawmakers. Republicans have defended the effort, saying the changes are legally justified and necessary to address concerns raised by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in early July. The DOJ concerns cited possible “coalition districts” drawn based on racial demographics, which it said could violate the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment. Texas Republicans also say Democrats have supported redistricting when it benefits them politically, and that GOP-led states should have the same opportunity to maximize partisan advantage. “Though this fight started in Texas, it doesn’t end here,” Drucilla Tigner, executive director of Texas for All, said in a statement emailed to The Epoch Times. “This isn’t just about redistricting or one state’s politics. It’s about the future of our democracy.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom has also weighed in, with his latest message warning that if Republicans proceed with mid-decade redistricting in Texas and other states, California will consider redrawing its own congressional lines to offset GOP gains. In a letter to President Donald Trump, Newsom urged him to tell Texas Republicans to abandon the plan, calling it a “hyper-partisan gerrymander” and an “affront to American democracy.” DNC Chair Ken Martin said the party has been mobilizing volunteers and resources in support of Texas Democrats, including sending more than 250,000 text messages to residents and coordinating national media outreach. “Now, the DNC is supporting Texas for All and state and national partners with the biggest Day of Action yet,“ Martin said in the statement to The Epoch Times. ”Democrats will never stop fighting for all Americans’ voices to be heard—in Texas and across the country.” Labor groups are also joining the effort. “From Texas to California to Illinois, the labor movement is united in resisting the Trump takeover,” Rick Levy, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, said in the statement. “This is a defining battle for the future of our democracy, and working people across the country understand the urgent need to act. As this fight continues to spread nationwide, we will stand strong this Saturday—to defend our votes, protect our rights, and stop this redistricting scheme.” Organizers say the protests are part of a broader push for redistricting reform, including the creation of independent commissions and greater transparency in map-drawing.

Connecticut, with its strong finance and insurance industries, comes in third at $93,235. All three leaders are at nearly twice the income last-ranked Mississippi ($52,017), reflecting the impact of specialized, high-skill industries on local income levels. Meanwhile, New York ($85,733), New Jersey ($84,071), and New Hampshire ($82,878) keep the broader Northeast near the top of the distribution. America’s West: The Tech Juggernaut California ($85,518) and Washington ($83,938) both place in the top 10 states by income. Their high incomes are linked to thriving technology and innovation economies, with major employers like Apple, Microsoft, and Google anchoring the regions. These states also attract high-skilled migrants, further boosting wage levels. American South Incomes Still Underperform The bottom of the ranking is dominated by Southern states, with Mississippi at $52,017 and West Virginia at $55,138. Lower wages, coupled with economies centered on agriculture and lower-wage manufacturing, contribute to these figures. These same states also have a higher rate of poverty, but also a lower cost of living.
