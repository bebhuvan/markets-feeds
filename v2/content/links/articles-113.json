    "fullContent": "DARPA's Theory Of Mind Warfare Authored by Matt Smith via InternationalMan.com, The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has an initiative called the Theory of Mind program. This effort is designed to give national security decision-makers the ability to model, simulate, and ultimately anticipate the intentions and behaviors of adversaries using a combination of advanced algorithms and human expertise. At its core, the program aims to: Build algorithmic models that “decompose” adversary strategies into elemental behaviors. Use massive data—signals intelligence, open-source information, even social media—to create high-fidelity “avatars” of enemy decision-makers. Simulate possible responses to a range of U.S. and allied actions, exploring which ones best deter, incentivize, or nudge adversaries toward preferred outcomes. Integrate insights from psychological profiling and machine learning to continually update these models as real-world conditions shift. The promise is profound: a system that doesn’t just predict what an adversary might do, but actively guides policymakers toward courses of action that shape the adversary’s decision calculus—minimizing escalation and maximizing U.S. strategic advantage. DARPA’s Theory of Mind program fundamentally changes how conflicts are managed. Decision-makers can run gaming scenarios at unprecedented detail and speed, customizing incentives or deterrents tailored to both cultural and individual psychologies. Risks of unintended escalation might be sharply reduced, while opportunities to “push the line” without crossing it become clearer. Theory of Mind Warfare Turned on the American Public in 2020 The same tools originally designed for military use were later deployed against the American (and global) public in 2020 AI-powered behavioral analytics, inspired by military-grade “theory of mind” models, were strategically employed during the COVID-19 pandemic to not just inform but actively shape public perception, sentiment, and compliance—creating a continuous feedback loop between government actions and public psychology. These systems quietly moved the world’s response from reactive to adaptive, fundamentally influencing how populations experienced and responded to the scamdemic. How These Systems Shaped Public Minds 1. Real-Time Sentiment Analysis and Information Targeting AI-powered platforms actively monitored social media, news, and digital conversations to track shifts in public mood, anxieties, and resistance to emerging health policies. These tools analyzed tone, emotional context, and response patterns following government announcements, often providing immediate feedback to policymakers on how their messaging was being received. 2. Tailored Messaging and Adaptive Communication Insights from these platforms allowed authorities to: Refine government communication strategies Push “approved” narratives to counter “misinformation” Adjust messaging in real time to allay public fears, address misconceptions, or reinforce confidence in health measures such as lockdowns or vaccines Remember this… 3. Behavioral Nudges and Targeted Interventions. Governments, aided by behavioral insights teams and AI analysts, designed “nudge” interventions—such as targeted text reminders, default scheduling of vaccine appointments, and personalized risk feedback—to increase uptake of desired behaviors. Rapid A/B testing determined which messages or policy tweaks worked best for specific populations. 4. Feedback Loops for Policy Calibration. Behavioral and sentiment data were continuously fed back into policy decision-making. If public adherence waned or opposition spiked (visible through sentiment tracking), messaging and interventions could be swiftly recalibrated to regain support or mitigate disinformation spikes. 5. Data-Driven Misinformation Management. AI-driven platforms scanned for and flagged viral misinformation. Rapid response teams could then deploy counter-messaging or media campaigns—often through the same platforms—using knowledge of which narratives resonated with hesitant demographics. Covid Was Just the Beginning: The Theory of Mind at Work in Recent Theaters of War Given the ambition of such strategic modeling, it’s worth asking whether this kind of “hyper-rational,” AI-enabled approach helps explain what we’ve seen in several recent, high-stakes military theaters. The Pager Attack and Decapitation of Hezbollah’s Leadership What Happened: In September 2024, thousands of pagers distributed to Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon and Syria exploded nearly simultaneously. The devices, covertly manufactured and seeded by Israel through a shell company, had been rigged with miniature explosives. The result: dozens killed or wounded—mostly Hezbollah operatives, but also some civilians—crippling the group’s command structure and sowing panic throughout its ranks. Fit with Theory of Mind: This operation demonstrates the power of deep adversary modeling. Israeli intelligence anticipated Hezbollah would switch to “low-tech” communications to evade modern surveillance. By predicting both the technological pivot and its psychological underpinnings, Israel was able to seed and trigger a devastating attack at a moment of maximum vulnerability—an almost textbook application of an algorithmic Theory of Mind approach. It wasn’t just about killing leaders; it was about destabilizing the group’s sense of security, disrupting its decision-making networks, and shaping its strategies long-term. Israel’s Operation Red Wedding & Operation Narnia: The 2025 Strikes on Iran What Happened: The Israeli attack that kicked off the 12-day war with Iran in June 2025 stands as one of the most dramatic and meticulously orchestrated military operations in recent Middle East history. This surprise assault was codenamed Operation Red Wedding (targeting Iran’s top military leadership) and Operation Narnia (targeting nuclear scientists), both designed to deliver a strategic shock to Iran’s command, control, and nuclear capabilities. In the early hours of June 13, 2025, Israel launched intensive airstrikes and covert operations inside Iran. Leveraging deep intelligence penetration, Israeli operatives lured over 30 of Iran’s top military leaders—including Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the IRGC’s Aerospace Force—into a fortified underground bunker in Tehran, where they were killed with precision strikes. Simultaneously, Israeli forces targeted Iran’s nuclear program by assassinating at least nine senior nuclear scientists and striking several critical sites. The initial waves consisted of over 200 strike sorties and more than 330 munitions used against nearly 100 high-priority targets, decapitating Iran’s military leadership and significantly damaging its nuclear infrastructure. The aftermath included at least 1,100 Iranian dead (over 30 senior commanders and 11 nuclear scientists), thousands wounded, massive damage to nuclear and missile facilities, and extensive civilian displacement. The algo must have hiccupped, because Iran didn’t collapse, they fought back. Iran’s retaliation included over 550 ballistic missiles and 1,000 suicide drones fired at Israel, bringing about a wide regional escalation, but the AI system gained control over the situation likely directing US involvement and ultimately stopping short of all-out open war. Fit with Theory of Mind: This operation reflects detailed adversary modeling and scenario simulation. Israel orchestrated a complex deception to gather Iranian leadership, carefully timed simultaneous strikes, and targeted high-value assets. The approach failed to correctly anticipate Iranian responses, but sought to degrade capabilities and leveraged psychological impact to magnify the strategic effect. This was an operation not only of military power, but of insight into adversary psychology and escalation management—embodying the goals and tools of Theory of Mind-style strategy. The decapitation plan failed, but the AI driven system kept working on the problem until a satisfactory resolution was achieved, “The Twelve Day War” was over. Operation Spiderweb: Ukraine’s Drone Assault on Russia’s Bomber Fleet What Happened: Operation Spiderweb was an unprecedented Ukrainian covert operation that dramatically changed modern warfare by targeting Russia’s strategic bomber fleet. On June 1, 2025, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) launched the largest drone attack of the war against Russian airbases deep inside Russian territory—reaching as far as Siberia. Over 18 months, Ukrainian operatives smuggled 117 FPV (first-person view) drones into Russia, hiding them atop trucks near key airfields, where they were remotely activated for the attack. Targets included airbases at Belaya, Dyagilevo, Ivanovo Severny, Olenya, and Ukrainka. At least 41 Russian military aircraft—Tu-160, Tu-95, Tu-22M bombers, and A-50 Airborne Early Warning aircraft—were claimed damaged or destroyed. The strikes severely impacted about one-third of Russia’s cruise missile carrier fleet and forced Moscow to disperse its remaining bombers, exposing a previously assumed safe strategic asset and dealing a psychological and operational blow to Russia. Fit with Theory of Mind: Operation Spiderweb exemplified adversary modeling and calculated escalation management. Ukrainian planners anticipated the psychological, strategic, and logistical ramifications of attacking these high-value targets—carefully avoiding nuclear escalation. By choosing the fleet’s means of launch (aircraft and support assets) rather than command centers or nuclear warheads, the operation demonstrated deep understanding of Russian red lines and risk thresholds. This is precisely the kind of strategic, “mind-reading” planning that DARPA’s Theory of Mind program envisions: leveraging intelligence and simulation to shape adversary perceptions, limit escalation, and achieve operational surprise. The events in Lebanon, Iran, Russia, and in our own countries suggest that today’s “gray zone” warfare is increasingly being shaped by decision-makers armed with unprecedented, algorithmic insight into adversary psychology and strategy—the very vision that DARPA’s Theory of Mind program is bringing to the fore. These are not just wars of bombs and bullets, but of information, perception, and calculated influence—run through a cybernetic loop of prediction, adaptation, and real-time feedback. This Is What Modern Warfare Looks Like The United States and its allies have clearly adopted the new “Theory of Mind” model of warfare not merely as a technological leap, but as a strategic necessity. No kinetic action could have moved the American public the way the covid psychological operations did. And in the conflict with Russia, traditional methods of waging war could easily result in total nuclear war. In other cases, our conventional systems alone don’t provide us with the technological supremacy they once did. The US is seeking supremacy elsewhere – algorithmic adversary modeling, predictive analytics, and adaptive scenario simulation to anticipate, shape, and, if necessary, outmaneuver opponents in political and military “gray zones” as well as open conflict. Theory of Mind Warfare Advantages Pace & Complexity: Modern battlefields blend information, cyber, economic, and kinetic operations. AI-driven systems offer an edge in parsing this complexity and accelerating the decision loop, enabling more adaptive and precise responses—far faster than traditional command structures alone can manage. Red Line Management: As conflicts brush up against escalation thresholds (nuclear, regional, or domestic-political), decision-makers must test boundaries without inadvertently crossing them. Predictive tools allow strategists to simulate outcomes, calibrate messaging, and “push the line” while minimizing catastrophic missteps. Deterrence & Shaping: The aim is less about destruction and more about influencing adversaries’ perceptions, decision timelines, and threat assessments—using information dominance and rapid feedback to keep the upper hand. War? What War?: Perhaps best of all, Theory of the Mind warfare leaves the adversary in a state of uncertainty. If Americans knew FOR SURE we were under attack and BY WHOM during the Covid hysteria, how would we have responded? Even Russia, despite red lines being crossed repeatedly, still considers itself not at war. The New Weapons of Warfare We are seeing the emergence of military ecosystems where software platforms like those developed by Palantir and defense partners serve as digital backbones for the DARPA “theory of mind” concept. The company leading this new weapons system revolution is Palantir. Their Maven system has been deployed by the IDF and is known to have been used in Gaza. In all likelihood, it was used in Lebanon and Iran as well. Palantir’s Maven integrates satellite imagery, geolocation, communications intercepts, and other sensor data into a unified analysis platform. It enables real-time adversary modeling, target selection, and campaign simulation—crucially, using AI to predict responses and ripple effects well beyond the immediate area of operations. During the PLANDEMIC Palantir’s Gotham and Foundry platforms were vital in integrating demographic, health, and behavioral data for agencies like the CDC, providing not only epidemiological tracking but also feedback on the public’s response to evolving guidelines and restrictions. Since Trump came into office, the DoD doubled its contract with Palantir to nearly $1.3b. ICE signed a deal with Palantir to develop a real-time platform for tracking migrants inside the US. Palantir also signed deals with DHS, Social Security Administration, and the IRS to centralize data platforms and expand Palantir Foundry’s use. Where’s this all going? And most important, Are we still the adversary? * * * As DARPA’s “Theory of Mind” warfare quietly shapes the global battlefield—and even the public consciousness—it’s clear we’ve entered a new era where perception is the primary terrain and algorithmic influence is the weapon of choice. Whether it’s drones over Russia, digital nudges during pandemics, or psychological pressure campaigns at home, the future is no longer about brute force—it’s about control of the narrative, and control of your decisions. If you understand what that truly means… you know this isn’t just a military shift. It’s a signal. One that tells us the systems designed to outmaneuver foreign adversaries are now being repurposed to manage you. So the question is: Will you be modeled, or will you opt out of the model?

    "fullContent": "Never-Before-Seen Photos Inside Jeffrey Epstein's Creepy Mansion The New York Times published never-before-seen photos from inside Jeffrey Epstein's erie seven-story Upper East Side townhouse on Tuesday, revealing surveillance cameras placed in bedrooms and a first edition of \"Lolita\" prominently displayed throughout the New York City mansion. Among the bizarre scenes is a macabre sculpture of a woman in a bridal gown dangling from a rope greeting visitors in the entryway, alongside dozens of framed fake eyeballs in a display that raises serious questions about what really went on behind closed doors. A copy of “Lolita,” the 1955 novel where a deviant repeatedly rapes a 12-year-old girl with whom he has become obsessed, was also spotted in an office. Among Epstein’s possessions was a first edition of Vladimir Nabokov’s novel “Lolita” — in which the main character rapes a 12-year-old girl with whom he has become obsessed. SDNY However, the most eyebrow-raising photo is a $1 bill bearing a handwritten note from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. \"I was wrong!\" Gates appeared to have scrawled on the note. Epstein's residence was also adorned with framed photographs featuring prominent figures such as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Pope John Paul II, Richard Branson, Elon Musk, and others, according to the Times. Another flight up, on the third floor, was Mr. Epstein’s sanctum — a suite that included his bedroom, the mansion’s infamous massage room and a cluster of bathrooms. More via the Times: As a gift for Jeffrey Epstein’s 63rd birthday, friends sent letters in tribute to the wealthy financier and convicted sex offender. Several shared a common theme: recounting the dinner gatherings that Mr. Epstein regularly hosted at his palatial townhouse on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Ehud Barak, former prime minister of Israel, and his wife noted the great diversity of guests. “There is no limit to your curiosity,” they wrote in their message, which was compiled with others in January 2016. “You are like a closed book to many of them but you know everything about everyone.” The media mogul Mortimer Zuckerman suggested ingredients for a meal that would reflect the culture of the mansion: a simple salad and whatever else “would enhance Jeffrey’s sexual performance.” And the director Woody Allen described how the dinners reminded him of Dracula’s castle, “where Lugosi has three young female vampires who service the place.” The freshly published photos have slowly emerged over the years as part of the mountain of evidence that came to light when Epstein was finally arrested in 2019 on child sex-trafficking charges. The photos are the latest development in the ongoing Epstein saga, which continues to generate controversy after the Department of Justice and the FBI released a joint memo last month claiming that an \"exhaustive review\" of evidence from Epstein's death definitively ruled out murder. \"After a thorough investigation, FBI investigators concluded that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on August 10, 2019,\" the memo reads. The agencies also denied the existence of a \"client list\" tied to Epstein, directly contradicting earlier remarks by Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi had previously suggested on Fox News that such a list was \"sitting on my desk\" for review, igniting speculation about Epstein's possible blackmailing of globalist elites. A photo from 2011 shows (from left) James Staley, Lawrence Summers, Epstein, Bill Gates and Boris Nikolic at the late pedophile’s Manhattan home. Trump has repeatedly sought to dismiss the scandal, accusing Democrats of fabricating a hoax around Epstein to thwart his agenda. Additionally, new questions have emerged about surveillance footage from the night before Epstein's death. An unidentified orange object seen in the surveillance video near the jail cell of deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein on the evening before his death has prompted a flurry of questions from forensic experts. The pixelated shape, first witnessed by CBS News, is seen shifting towards Epstein's cell block at the Metropolitan Correctional Center around 10:40 p.m.The object was a corrections officer \"carrying linen or inmate clothing,\" according to federal investigators. However, experts told CBS News that it could in fact be an inmate wearing a jumpsuit. \"Based on the limited video, it's more likely a person in an [orange] uniform,\" Conor McCourt, forensic video expert, said in a statement. \"To say that there's no way that someone could get to that, the stairs up to his room, without being seen is false,\" Jim Safford, another forensic expert, told the news network. Epstein was discovered deceased in his cell on August 10, 2019. An official autopsy, corroborated by a joint investigation from the Department of Justice and FBI, concluded that the disgraced financier died by suicide through hanging. Epstein’s home office featured a taxidermied tiger. In a statement to CBS News, the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General said the footage does not change its conclusion on Epstein's death. \"Our comprehensive assessment of the circumstances over the weeks, days, and hours before Epstein's death included the effects of the longstanding, chronic staffing crisis in the [Bureau of Prisons] and the BOP's failure to provide and maintain quality camera coverage within its facilities,\" the statement to the outlet read.

    "fullContent": "Taibbi: No Doubt Left... Russiagate Was A Cover-Up Authored by Matt Taibbi via Racket News, The most infuriatingly complex scandal of all time has just been reduced to a page or two, thanks to another declassified release... It was a cover-up. The Russiagate scandal has long been one of the most convoluted, hard-to-follow news stories of all time. It even has multiple names thanks to its peculiar chronology. From 2016 until April 2019 — while Democrats still held out hope of “presidency-wrecking” revelations that would topple Donald Trump — it was generally known as the Trump-Russia scandal. After Special Counsel Robert Mueller broke the hearts of MSNBC audiences by issuing a report without new indictments, attention began to be cast on the scandal’s fraudulent construction, how it was propped up by political spying, illegal leaks, and WMD-style intelligence fakery. Trump and others began to call it Spygate or the Russia hoax, but the name that stuck was Russiagate. Those of us who covered the story from the start had a difficult time explaining to audiences what it was, as we ourselves didn’t know. Now we do, after a month of disclosures, capped yesterday by the release of an explosive (and inexplicably long-classified) annex to the report of Special Counsel John Durham. Finally, it seems, we can explain how the idea that Donald Trump was “gaffing his way toward treason” through a secret love affair (really!) with Vladimir Putin and extensive “ties” or “links” with Russia suddenly became The Biggest Story in the World in the summer of 2016. “THE KISS”: Media outlets were promoting the “love story” as early as March 2016 It wasn’t the start of a corruption story about Trump, but the cover-up of a still-unresolved Hillary Clinton scandal. This is purely a Clinton corruption story, probably the last in a long line, as neither Bill nor Hillary will have careers when it’s finished, if they stay out of jail. Characteristically, the most powerful political family since the Kennedys won’t just bring many individuals down with them, but whole institutions, as the FBI, the CIA, the presidency of Barack Obama, and a dozen or so of the most celebrated brands in commercial media will see their names blackened forever through association with this idiotic caper. A fair number of those media companies should (and likely will) go out of business. Now, we know. With the help of the declassified Durham material, we can explain the whole affair in three brushstrokes. One, Hillary Clinton and her team apparently hoped to deflect from her email scandal and other problems via a campaign tying Trump to Putin. Two, American security services learned of these plans. Three — and this is the most important part — instead of outing them, authorities used state resources to massively expand and amplify her scheme. The last stage required the enthusiastic cooperation and canine incuriosity of the entire commercial news business, which cheered as conspirators made an enforcement target of Trump, actually an irrelevant bystander. I’ve tiptoed for years around what I believed to be true about this case, worrying some mitigating fact might emerge. Now, there’s no doubt. Hillary Clinton got in a jam, and the FBI, CIA, and the Obama White House got her out of it by setting Trump up. That’s it. It was a cover-up, plain and simple... ... These people just can’t stop lying. The whole thing is one endless lie, the reason for which is now clear. Hillary Clinton got in trouble being dumb, tried to save herself by doing something dumber, and all of American officialdom backed the play. That’s it. A last period of denials awaits, but they’ll fizzle like the rest, after which not much will be left but blunt truth — and hopefully, consequences.

    "fullContent": "Waste Of The Day: Senate Furniture Is Missing Authored by Jeremy Portnoy via RealClearInvestigations, Topline: Over the last decade, more than half the Senate office furniture purchased have some unanswered question attached to them - including where the furniture is located. The Architect of the Capitol’s Senate Furniture Program “needs significant improvements,” and its “processes for acquiring, safeguarding, transferring, and disposing of furniture are inefficient and ineffective,” according to a new audit from the Architect of the Capitol’s inspector general. Key facts: The Architect is responsible for maintaining the buildings and grounds on Capitol Hill, but it typically only buys furniture for Senate office buildings. The office bought 29,603 pieces of furniture from 2014 to 2024, costing taxpayers $22.6 million. “A minimum” of 13,159 pieces of furniture (51%) have \"erroneous information,” according to the audit. Some mistakes are minor — an incorrect tag number or description — but others are much larger, including that no one knows where the furniture is, how much it cost, or both. First, auditors randomly selected a piece of furniture listed in the Architect’s computer catalog, but staffers were unable to locate it. The only clue showing the furniture’s location was a handwritten note from 2012, but the furniture was not actually at that location. Next, the auditors randomly selected another piece of furniture. Architect staffers were able to find this one, but not any documents showing its cost — they had been lost in a flood. Finally, auditors allowed Architect staffers to choose the piece of furniture that would be reviewed by the inspector general. Still, auditors found five issues with the hand-selected piece of furniture, including forms with missing signatures and conflicting dollar costs on different documents. Overall, auditors reviewed 138 pieces of furniture but were unable to locate 71 of them. The Architect leases building space to store extra furniture, but the buildings are poorly maintained and are sometimes unusable, according to the audit. The Architect is also buying too many items. There are “several dozen” microwaves in storage to eventually replace the current microwaves, but the extras may be “obsolete” before they are needed. Staffers have also been leaving furniture unattended in hallways, which will make it harder to prevent theft, according to the audit. Search all federal, state and local salaries and vendor spending with the world’s largest government spending database at OpenTheBooks.com. Summary: After the federal government’s $3.3 billion spending spree on furniture during the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s no wonder officials are having trouble keeping track of it all.

    "fullContent": "Crude Jittery As Trump Mulls New Sanctions On Russia's 'Shadow Fleet' Oil prices remain jittery today as the market digests yet another sanctions-threat targeting Russia. President Trump is said to be mulling new sanctions on Russia’s so-called \"shadow fleet\" of oil tankers if Moscow doesn't commit to a peace agreement with Ukraine by Friday. Despite many threats, the Trump White House has yet to impose new sanctions on Russia since he took office. Already the Russian economy is incredibly isolated in the West's eyes, while a growing Kremlin reliance on leading BRICS countries such as China and India has emerged. Postimees/Scanpix Baltics via Reuters Connect: On November 4, 2025, Estonian authorities detained an oil tanker that formed part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" and that had been sailing through Estonian waters in the Gulf of Finland. Both of these countries have said they don't plant to change course on Russian energy, even in the face of secondary sanctions which are being dangled by Washington. Financial Times describes that oil sales from this 'shadow fleet' has been a key source of funding for the Kremlin's war machine: The “shadow fleet” consists of ships with obscure ownership structures that avoid Western services like insurance and logistics, making it difficult to penalize the owners directly. However, recent efforts to sanction the ships themselves have shown some success. According to two individuals familiar with White House discussions, sanctions on the shadow fleet are viewed as a relatively straightforward way to increase pressure on Russia. A third source close to the administration confirmed that broader sanctions options, including targeting the fleet, are under review. There are existing Biden era sanctions on over 200 named Russian crude, chemical, and product tankers. Trump has reportedly held back on expanding these sanctions on hopes of achieving ceasefire in Ukraine. Russia has until Friday, sources cited in the FT say. \"If enacted, additional U.S. measures would reinforce similar efforts by the European Union. Last month, the EU added over 100 ships to its sanctions list, raising the total to 415.\" This has done nothing to deter Putin's 'Special Military Operation' in Ukraine. In many ways the West is out of 'solutions' as it has sanctioned Russia to unprecedented levels - and yet this has done little. The ultimate answer from Moscow's point of view remains significant territorial concessions by Kiev and a clear binding pledge to never join NATO. And yet the Zelensky government has refused.

    "fullContent": "White House Order To Punish Banks That Discriminate Against Conservatives, Crypto Companies The White House is about to unveil a new executive order that would punish big banks who discriminate against conservatives and crypto companies. A draft of the order seen by the WSJ directs bank regulators to investigate whether any financial institutions may have violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust laws, or consumer financial protection laws - with violators facing monetary penalties, consent decrees or other disciplinary measures, according to the draft. People familiar with the EO told the Journal that it could be signed as soon as this week, though the order could become delayed or the administration's plans may change. The draft order doesn’t name any specific banks but appears to refer to an instance where Bank of America was accused of shutting down the accounts of a Christian organization operating in Uganda based on the organization’s religious beliefs. The bank has said it shut down the accounts because it doesn’t serve small businesses operating outside the U.S. The draft order also criticizes the role that some banks played in an investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol. -WSJ As Cointelegraph notes, conservatives have also claimed that banks have denied them services based on political beliefs. The banking industry calls the practice “derisking,” and financial institutions have broad discretion to close accounts, whether the account holder poses a legal, financial or reputational risk to the firm. The Federal Reserve said in June that it would stop examining for reputational risk following similar moves made by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. Crypto, meanwhile, was long in the crosshairs of the Biden administration - in what industry executives have alleged was an effort to cut crypto off from the financial system by using regulators to pressure banks into backing away from clients involved in digital assets. As the outlet reports further, the reported draft order directs bank regulators to scrap any of their policies that may have contributed to banks dropping some customers, such as crypto firms. It also directs the US government’s Small Business Administration to review banking practices that guarantee the loans made by the agency to small businesses. The order asks regulators to refer some of the potential violations to the attorney general for the Department of Justice to follow up. The Journal reported in June that the White House was planning for Trump to sign a similar order aiming at stopping banks from cutting off services to industries such as crypto. “Operation Choke Point 2.0” claims Crypto executives have claimed that former President Joe Biden began to cut off their industry from banking in late 2022 after the collapse of FTX, with the crypto exchange being revealed as a massive fraud. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal testified at a Congressional hearing in February that the Biden-era Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) “bludgeoned the banks” with examinations and questions around crypto and stablecoins until they “relented under the pressure.” A Coinbase-supported Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the FDIC showed the agency asked certain financial institutions to pause crypto banking activities, which Grewal said showed the industry’s claim “wasn’t just some crypto conspiracy theory.” Crypto venture capitalist Nic Carter coined the term “Operation Choke Point 2.0” in February 2023 to describe the perceived debanking phenomenon, taking inspiration from the Justice Department’s “Operation Choke Point” against banks and payday lenders in the 2010s.
