    "fullContent": "UPenn Student Paper: School Caving To Trump Admin Over Men In Women's Sports Is \"Fascism\" By Dave Huber of The College Fix The University of Pennsylvania student paper is very upset the school agreed to Trump administration demands regarding men’s participation in women’s sports — so much so it says UPenn is “descending into fascism” (its headline). The Daily Pennsylvanian Summer Opinion Editor Ingrid Holmquist and her summer-session cohorts say their editorial is not about the UPenn (women’s) swim team (and surrounding Lia Thomas controversy) nor “NCAA guidelines” or “biological sex characteristics.” Except that … it really is. “In allowing the federal government to make a decision that belongs to our community, Penn has violated our trust in a way that may be impossible to restore,” the editors write. “Our administration could have said no, fighting in court to keep the government out of our athletic policies.” Furthermore, UPenn made a deal with an administration that has “proven hostile to human rights,” and this agreement “affirmed the belief” for the university that Trump’s actions were “logical [and] legal.” “Throughout history, authoritarian regimes have begun their crackdowns with an attack on universities — beacons of dissent and social progress,” the editors continue. “We can’t ignore the warning signs. Penn’s actions are exactly what it looks like to give in to extortion disguised as governance.” Hostile to human rights? The Ivy Leaguers’ proof: a link to the notoriously centrist (ha ha) Amnesty International which claims Trump is “targeting immigrants,” “attacking freedom of expression and the right to protest,” and “marginalizing Black and other racialized communities.” Logical? Remember when the geniuses in the academy and media lectured us about believing in science? Apparently there’s nothing logical or scientific about not wanting men to compete against women in sports. Legal? Wait, it’s illegal to keep federal monies from entities which do not want to comply with federal desires? Ask states that had drinking ages under 21 how that worked out for them. Authoritarian/fascist regimes? Yes, let’s buy into these budding journalists’ definition of “fascism”; meanwhile, Editor Holmquist (pictured) doesn’t believe downtown Philadelphia is a dangerous place and chides her peers for thinking otherwise (certain demographics, you see). UPenn’s agreement with the Trump administration got it back $175 million. You know what the school’s endowment is worth? Over $22 billion. This means UPenn saved a whopping 0.8 percent of its endowment by conceding to Trump. If it really needs to be pointed out, UPenn can give a middle finger to President Trump by forgoing all federal monies. This is precisely what Hillsdale College does to “maintain its institutional independence.” Twenty-two billion is a helluva lot of money, UPenn. Just throw back that $175 mill (and more), and you’ll be free to not only let Lia Thomas and other men compete against women, but from the shackles of … FASCISM!

    "fullContent": "​​​​​​​\"Enough Is Enough\": Boeing Fighter Jet Workers Begin Strike Update (0635ET): More than 3,200 union members who assemble Boeing's fighter jets across multiple plants in the St. Louis area and Illinois went on strike earlier this morning, after voting on Sunday to reject a modified four-year labor deal with the defense company. This marks the union's first strike since 1996. Workers display picket signs, as they protest during a walkout by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) over contract negotiations, outside Boeing company's facility, in Berkeley, Missouri, U.S., August 4, 2025 REUTERS/Lawrence Bryant \"STRIKE ALERT: 3,200 highly-skilled IAM Union members at Boeing went on strike at midnight because enough is enough,\" the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 837 (IAM District 837) wrote on X around 0200 ET. 🚨 STRIKE ALERT: 3,200 highly-skilled IAM Union members at Boeing went on strike at midnight because enough is enough. This is about respect and dignity, not empty promises. https://t.co/2mRlPkmOMm #UnionStrong — IAM Union (@IAM_Union) August 4, 2025 \"We're disappointed our employees in St. Louis rejected an offer that featured 40% average wage growth,\" Dan Gillian, Boeing vice president and general manager of the St. Louis facilities, told Reuters in a statement. Important to note: IAM District 837 workers assemble Boeing's F-15 and F/A-18 fighters, the T-7 trainer, and the MQ-25. In markets, Boeing shares traded flat in premarket trading in New York. We suspect investors will pay more attention if the strike drags on. The last one in 1996 lasted 99 days. * * * The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 837, representing 3,200 Boeing defense workers across Missouri and Illinois and affiliated with the AFL–CIO/CLC, has rejected a modified four-year labor deal with Boeing. As a result, for the first time since 1996, a strike will begin at midnight, impacting operations at key fighter jet plants. \"IAM District 837 members have spoken loud and clear, they deserve a contract that reflects their skill, dedication, and the critical role they play in our nation's defense,\" IAM District 837 Directing Business Representative Tom Boelling stated in a press release, adding, \"We stand shoulder to shoulder with these working families as they fight for fairness and respect on the job.\" The 3,200 machinists were in a week-long federally mandated \"cooling-off\" period after rejecting Boeing's initial labor contract last Sunday. By Friday, Boeing presented a modified offer that included a 20% pay boost, raising average annual pay from $75,000 to $102,600, along with other perks, including a $5,000 signing bonus. For some context, the last time IAM District 837 went on strike was in 1996, a labor action that lasted 99 days. There's no telling how long the current stoppage will last, but it will undoubtedly impact operations at the F-15, F/A-18, and cutting-edge missile and defense technologies plants. The timing of the strike comes as the world is on fire and deepening into a bipolar state. We asked a very simple question early last week: One must ask whether foreign adversaries, as part of their hybrid warfare campaign to implode the US from within, have exploited this union in an attempt to strike a critical node in America's defense manufacturing hub. Attacking Critical Nodes? US Fighter Jet Factories At Risk Of Labor Strike By Democrat-Aligned Union Indeed, the heads of IAM District 837 were pro-globalist Joe Biden... It's not far-fetched to suggest that foreign adversaries could infiltrate unions; it's a well-documented tactic in the hybrid warfare playbook. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 06:35",
