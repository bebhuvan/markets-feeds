He added, “There is exasperation at Zelensky in the donor community.” Early last week, there were unexpected images coming from Kiev of the largest demonstrations against the Ukrainian government since Russia invaded more than three years ago, as more than 2,000 people gathered near the president's office, shouting \"shame\" and \"veto the law,\" after President Zelensky signed a law gutting the country's anti-corruption agency.

The pact comes less than a week before a Friday deadline for President Donald Trump’s higher tariffs to take effect on August 1. The president in May threatened to impose a 50% duty on nearly all EU goods, adding pressure that accelerated negotiations, before lowering that to 30%. Trump made the announcement at Trump Turnberry, his seaside golf resort in western Scotland, after meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who leads the EU’s executive body. 🚨BREAKING: President Trump lands EU trade deal: - EU to purchase $750 billion in US and invest $600 billion in US - EU to purchase a “vast amount” of military equipment - EU opens up markets ",

President Trump’s signature piece of legislation allocated $3.3 billion to the DOJ, some of which will go toward the Byrne-JAG Grant Program, a federal initiative created in 2005 which provides support for local law enforcement and criminal justice efforts. To access the new funds, which supplement the $499 million already appropriated for the Byrne-JAG program in 2025, localities must comply with a section of federal immigration law that forbids them from restricting communication between their law enforcement entities and the Department of Homeland Security regarding an individual’s immigration status.

There were also instances of drowning as aid was dropped into the sea during the 2024 efforts. For example a single day in March of last year saw 18 people die trying to desperately access the aid. But given that at this point scores of people are dying each day from hunger, air drops are increasingly a risk everyone (or Western countries) is willing to take - even as Israel's military is still exercising a tight grip on what aid is allowed into Gaza and who distributes it.

The local sheriff’s office is investigating the attack and details are limited, but Michigan State Police confirmed that a suspect was in custody. Meanwhile, T.J.Muscaro reports for The Epoch Times that Munson Healthcare posted on social media that 11 people were being treated at a hospital in northern Michigan, and a spokeswoman further said that all 11 were stabbing victims. Spokesperson Megan Brown said late Saturday that six were in critical condition and five were in serious condition. The Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office later said in a statement on social media that the suspect was a 42-year-old man who entered the store around 4:45 p.m. A sheriff’s deputy arrived within minutes of the suspect drawing his knife. He was taken into custody, and people in the store also helped apprehend the suspect and treat victims, ",

At the beginning of July, city officials mounted a public outcry after Cincinnati-based Kroger Co. announced the decision to close at least five Pick 'n Save supermarket locations, including one in Milwaukee's Metcalfe Park neighborhood. The city was also notified by Walgreens that they will be closing at least seven locations over the next two years and CVS will be closing some locations as well.  Activists argue that the closures center around \"black and brown neighborhoods\" and that these areas \"deserve access\" to nearby grocery outlets.

    "summary": "Is The Epstein Affair A Watershed Moment? Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog, Perhaps when we look back on the Epstein Affair, we'll understand that it broke the back of Americans' faith in their political and law enforcement institutions. We're being told the Epstein Affair is old news, nothing to see here, move along--but I'm not so sure. It could be the opposite of old news, a watershed moment in American history.
