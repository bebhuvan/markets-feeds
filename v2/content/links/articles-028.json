    "fullContent": "'Mired In Soviet Decision-Making': Report Pins Immense Losses On Zelensky's Firing Of Gen. Zaluzhny The Western mainstream media continues the trend of turning on Ukraine, now that it's clear that it cannot win the war against Russia. Recall that during the opening couple years of war, the MSM treated any criticisms of Zelensky or the Ukrainian Army as totally off-limits. But now, a fresh Wall Street Journal report published Tuesday calls out Ukraine’s military for having increasingly adopted a rigid, Soviet-style command structure that stifles battlefield initiative. Atlantic Council in February 2024: Removal of Ukraine’s ‘Iron General’ is one of Zelenskyy’s biggest gambles. Image: Reuters Soldiers interviewed by the outlet described large-scale meatgrinder type tactics of blindly being sent on suicidal frontal assaults while being denied permission to withdraw from dangerous positions. The consistent commentary on the war has long been that while Russia might have the manpower to do these old 'war of attrition' tactics, Ukraine certainly does not. Ukrainian forces in the initial stages of the war were praised for their effective use of maneuver warfare and were more nimble and able to more quickly seize the initiative, or strategically retreat as necessary. \"Ukrainian officers and infantrymen complain of a centralized command culture that often punishes initiative and wastes men’s lives. Generals order repetitive frontal assaults that have little hope of success, and deny requests from beleaguered units to carry out tactical retreats and save their men. Casualties accumulate on operations with little strategic value,\" the WSJ report says. Front line commanders have increasingly gone public to voice their frustrations after witnessing needless tragic losses: Privately, many Ukrainian soldiers repeat a bitter refrain: “Big Soviet army beats little Soviet army.” Capt. Oleksandr Shyrshyn, a battalion commander in Ukraine’s 47th Mechanized Brigade, took his frustrations public. In May he denounced the army’s top brass on Facebook. Railing against “stupid” orders and losses, he spoke of pervasive fear in the army of generals who are “only capable of reprimands, investigations, imposing penalties.” Addressing the General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces, he said: “I hope your children will also be in the infantry and will carry out your tasks.” He told the Journal he was driven to speak out after his battalion was repeatedly ordered by senior commanders to launch assaults that were unrealistic for the unit’s limited means. We also should note something the WSJ and other establishment media won't admit: the Western allies' constant arms and monetary support - as well as the naive urging on of Ukraine forces to 'win' - has likely only encouraged such 'repetative' and 'unrealistic' frontal assaults. After all, if the US and NATO see Ukraine's military folding or holding back, they will be less inclined to offer big support, and the funds must keep flowing at all costs from Kiev's perspective. WSJ Chief Foreign Correspondent Yaroslav Trofimov observes that in the \"Early stages, Ukrainian forces were praised for their effective use of maneuver warfare,\" but now \"troops say that over time, the military shifted to a hierarchical, top-down approach reminiscent of Soviet-era tactics—resulting in heavier losses, declining morale, and a drop in recruitment.\" He also describes the surprise firing of a popular commander to have been key: \"Ukraine was successful the first year of the war because its army fought differently. Once Zelensky replaced Zaluzhny with Syrsky last year, it has turned into a war of a small Soviet army against a big Soviet army, with predictable consequences.\" Zaluzhny was shipped off to be ambassador to the United Kingdom, and some say he might be groomed by the West to eventually replace Zelensky. General Oleksandr Syrsky According to one key quote in the WSJ report: \"Syrsky remains widely unpopular with Ukrainian soldiers, many of whom see him as the epitome of the Soviet syndrome: a Moscow-trained career officer who micromanages units on the ground, delaying retreats or ordering assaults that lead to morale-sapping casualties for tree lines or other objectives with little strategic value.\" This also reflects the general war weariness among Ukrainians in general as well. A recent Gallup Poll shows support for the war to be slipping among the civilian population, with 69% now favoring a negotiated settlement to end the grinding war as soon as possible.

    "fullContent": "Michael Steele/Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BIEverybody wants to be Ryan Reynolds. Donald Trump wants to be Ryan Reynolds. The &#34;SmartLess&#34; podcast guys want to be Ryan Reynolds. Even Klarna wants to be Ryan Reynolds. I don't mean they want to star in &#34;Deadpool&#34; or marry Blake Lively (though neither of those is a bad deal). I mean that they're all slapping their brands on mobile phone networks in an attempt to make a little extra bank.If you're familiar with Mint Mobile, a mobile phone network that offers inexpensive prepaid plans, it's probably because you've seen Reynolds in an ad for it. The actor-turned-entrepreneur bought an estimated 25% stake in the company back in 2019, positioned himself as its spokesperson, and then sold it to T-Mobile for $1.35 billion in 2023, with Reynolds reportedly making $300 million off the deal.The concept of Mint Mobile isn't new: Virtual mobile network operators, which are telecom companies that offer mobile services without owning their own network infrastructure, like towers and stations, have been around for a long time. Some examples, besides Mint, include Cricket Wireless and Boost, though the latter is becoming a full-on wireless carrier and investing in its own 5G network. Reynolds offered a new spin by successfully attaching a big-name brand or celebrity to one. His achievement seems to have inspired others to get in on the game, including the president, some podcast hosts, and a buy-now-pay-later company.&#34;It's all Ryan Reynolds' fault. Sort of,&#34; says Avi Greengart, the founder and lead analyst at Techspontential, a research and advisory firm.In June, the Trump Organization announced the launch of Trump Mobile. Its website says the service will offer &#34;All-American performance&#34; on a $47.45 a month plan that includes unlimited talk, text, data, and calls to 100 international destinations. The Trumps are also selling a $499 gold-colored phone to accompany the plan.Everyone else on this list is thinking that if Ryan Reynolds can do it, why can't they?The same month, Will Arnett, Jason Bateman, and Sean Hayes, actors and the hosts of &#34;Smartless,&#34; said they are starting SmartLess Mobile, which promises to be &#34;direct-to-consumer, data-sane, and refreshingly BS-free.&#34; Their website boasts, &#34;Friends don't let friends overpay.&#34; SmartLess' value proposition is that it offers inexpensive, limited data plans that start as low as $15 a month. The argument is that most people have plans that give them unlimited cellular data, but they don't actually need all that download capacity, given how widely available WiFi is, so they wind up overpaying.&#34;The quick math is about half of the country use 10 gigs or fewer, but it's almost impossible not to buy unlimited,&#34; says Paul McAleese, the CEO of Smartless Mobile and a mobile industry veteran. &#34;Why we did it is because we recognize that gap, that data gap, which is really unique compared to any other product category. You don't go into the grocery store and buy 40 gallons of milk and consume two and then do it again the next month.&#34;As The Wall Street Journal noted around that time, celebrity cellular brands seem to be everywhere. Consumer brands are joining in, too. Klarna, the Sweden-based buy now, pay later company, is launching a mobile network of its own, too. In June, it invited consumers to sign up for a waitlist to join its $40-a-month plan. It may seem strange for an installment lender to get in the wireless game, but the company says it's a step in continuing to build its &#34;neobank offering.&#34;&#34;Everyone else on this list is thinking that if Ryan Reynolds can do it, why can't they?&#34; says Craig Moffett, a cofounder and senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, an equity research firm.It's not dissimilar to the rich and famous hopping on the liquor train in recent years. There's Reynolds' gin, Snoop Dogg's wine, George Clooney's tequila, Kendall Jenner's tequila, Kevin Hart's tequila. In a way, telecom is the new tequila.&#34;It's a sign of the times that every celebrity's reason for getting up in the morning is to think of ways they can monetize their celebrity,&#34; Moffett says.Mobile virtual network operators, which industry insiders call MVNOs, buy excess network capacity in bulk from major carriers — AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile — and sell it under their own brands. They profit from the differential between the wholesale rate they get and the amount they charge customers.&#34;It is a capital-light alternative without having to invest considerable sums in acquiring a licence, constructing a network, and so forth,&#34; says Paolo Pescatore, a telecom analyst at PP Foresight. He says that it can also work for brands that have a similar business to tack on an extra service for their customers, such as Comcast's XFinity Mobile, which it can tie in with its broadband service.For carriers, MVNOs are a way to make money off of capacity they're not using and try to reach niche markets they may not be able to connect with on their own — customers of different demographics, who speak different languages, and who have different interests. Their brands are very general, and in their marketing, they have to appeal to the general population.It's low risk. If the thing fails, no harm, no foul.&#34;Big carriers are not the most creative kind, and their advertising focuses on big customer segments. They don't have the time, effort, and focus to go after smaller customer segments,&#34; says Roger Entner, the founder and lead analyst at Recon Analytics, a research and analytics firm. &#34;It's low risk. If the thing fails, no harm, no foul.&#34;MVNOs are just a small sliver of the mobile market. Entner estimates there are about 15 million MVNO customers in the US (that excludes people who use MVNOs tied to cable companies, which are an additional 19 million or so). By comparison, the major carriers have upwards of 340 million.Anastasia Kārkliņa Gabriel, the author of &#34;Cultural Intelligence for Marketers,&#34; says that because consumers tend to distrust the big telecom players, an MVNO may signal a &#34;perception of independence&#34; for potential users. It gives an &#34;illusion of being separate from the major telco brands,&#34; she says, even if that's far from the case. Klarna is working with AT&amp;T, SmartLess is with T-Mobile, and the Trump Organization says they're working with all three major carriers.For the brands and individuals trying to launch mobile networks, the hope is that they have enough clout with their existing fan bases to get them to switch networks and sign up. Maybe you love Jason Bateman so much you feel like you have to have his phone plan, or you're so entrenched in Klarna's payments system and app, you switch your network to them. Or, in the case of the Trump family, you're MAGA. And given the president's long history of putting his name on things and promoting them, from buildings to steaks to wine, the move seems like a natural extension.&#34;The only surprising thing about Trump Mobile is that he didn't try this already,&#34; Greengart says.Trump Mobile didn't respond to a request for comment.McAleese, from SmartLess, says that while he's aware this may look like following in Reynolds' footsteps, that's not what's going on. Arnett served as a spokesperson for the Canadian company Freedom Mobile, which he also ran, back in 2018. &#34;Will did that job, frankly, before Ryan ever did,&#34; he says.Just because celeb-affiliated mobile networks are blooming does not mean they will flourish. It's a tough business to be in. ESPN failed at its MVNO efforts two decades ago, even with all the power of, you know, ESPN — though that attempt was also before the iPhone existed.It's an easy business to start, but it's a hard business to operate, Moffett explains. &#34;The MVNO network operator provides almost everything you need to get started. But once you spend money on marketing and customer service, it turns out to be a really tough way to make money,&#34; he says. &#34;To succeed, you need to achieve meaningful scale, and very, very few MVNOs ever do.&#34;Phone plans are sticky. It takes time and effort to switch your carrier from one brand to another, though the barrier is getting a bit lower these days. It's especially difficult if your phone plan is how you're paying off your device, or you're on a family plan with multiple lines. Many MVNOs don't offer plans with more than one or two lines, and few help customers finance their devices.Where a lot of them run into a buzzsaw is when there's not enough differentiation going on.As much as people may idolize certain celebrities or relate to certain brands, it's just not clear that they do so enough to want their entire consumer lives to reside in their ecosystems. Beyond the branding, a lot of these networks aren't particularly special in terms of the price or service they offer. Maybe they'll get some people, via social media posts and ads, but it may not be enough to grow and sustain a thriving business operation.&#34;Where a lot of them run into a buzzsaw is when there's not enough differentiation going on,&#34; Entner says. &#34;They bring nothing unique to it.&#34;He was skeptical of Klarna's move, too. &#34;It's a lower-cost acquisition channel, because if you're already paying off your burrito, they can also say, 'Hey, by the way, I know you're broke. Here's cheap service on top of it,'&#34; he says, referring to Klarna's BNPL deal that allows people to break up a DoorDash order into multiple installments. &#34;'I know so much about you, so I can tailor my offer exactly for you.' That's the logic. I probably don't agree with it, but knock yourself out.&#34;A Klarna spokesperson says in an email that &#34;unlike most new MVNOS, we're not starting from scratch, nor are we jumping on the bandwagon&#34; and that its mobile offering has been in the works for many months as part of a multiyear strategy. &#34;We're not trying to 'win' mobile or become the biggest carrier — this isn't about scale for its own sake,&#34; the spokesperson says. &#34;It's about solving a very real problem for the tens of millions of consumers who already trust Klarna to help manage their finances.&#34;SmartLess's McAlease says they &#34;wish everyone well&#34; who's trying to launch an MVNO right now, because competition is good for the industry, but &#34;they're just kind of on that unlimited train, and that might work for them and for their audience.&#34; Initial marketing efforts have focused on the SmartLess guys, for obvious reasons — you've got three big celebrities and a giant podcast in the mix, so why not? But it will soon shift more to what actually differentiates it.&#34;You're going to start seeing much more product- and price-focused things over the course of the next while,&#34; McAelase says. &#34;It's always tricky for MVNOs to break through the noise, and we're fortunate to have a brand and principles that are happy to do that.&#34;Pescatore says that MVNOs have been more successful in other countries, such as the supermarket Tesco's mobile network in the UK. But it's challenging. &#34;There are opportunities in a mature market like the US, given the price of existing services from mobile network providers. Ultimately, it needs to tightly integrate and complement the existing service and offer something truly novel to attract subscribers,&#34; he says.The track record of these projects working out may not deter brands and public figures from trying. Entner says he knows of multiple MVNOs that are in development. Apple has long faced speculation that it might launch an MVNO, though it always denies it. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.Will all these projects work out? It seems unlikely, but it could happen. Some of these packages are pretty cheap, and hey, if you like some actor enough to switch your cellphone plan for them, by all means.Emily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "fullContent": "Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund Ups Its Indirect Exposure To Bitcoin Authored by Vince Quill via CoinTelegraph.com, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest state-directed wealth fund in the world, increased its indirect Bitcoin exposure by 192% over the last year, according to crypto research company K33 Research. The fund has indirect exposure to 7,161 BTC through its investment portfolio, which includes treasury companies Strategy and Metaplanet and crypto exchange Coinbase. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund continues to increase its Bitcoin and crypto exposure. Source: Vetle Lunde The fund currently holds over 11.9 billion Norwegian krone ($1.2 billion) of Strategy’s stock, a 133% increase from 2024. Similarly, the fund has increased its Coinbase holdings by over 96% since 2024. Norway’s increase in BTC holdings reflects a broader trend of sovereign wealth funds gaining indirect exposure through BTC investment vehicles and corporate proxies, as the world’s first cryptocurrency becomes integrated into the traditional financial system. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund also increased exposure to BTC holding company Strategy in 2025. Source: Norges Bank Investment Management Sovereign and state wealth funds enter crypto game through the side door Sovereign wealth and state pension funds legally mandate managers to invest only in pre-defined asset classes such as fixed-income securities, corporate bonds, equities and others. Because of these restrictions, fund managers who want to invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies must gain indirect exposure through an investment vehicle like an exchange-traded fund (ETF), a corporate bond or a company proxy like Strategy. The State of Wisconsin State Investment Board (SWIB), the organization that manages the US state’s pension system, was one of the first state-level pension funds in the country to disclose indirect Bitcoin exposure through a $164 million investment into BTC ETFs. In February, SWIB disclosed that its BTC holdings nearly doubled, surging to over $321 million, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. The pension manager sold off BTC holdings in May but retained a $50 million position in BTC proxy Strategy. Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund announced in July that it plans to convert a portion of its assets to crypto. Timur Suleimenov, head of the National Bank of Kazakhstan, said the prospective move is intended to generate more investment income for the wealth fund, and the government is also exploring converting other assets like gold and foreign currency reserves to crypto.
