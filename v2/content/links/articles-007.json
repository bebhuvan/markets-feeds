    "fullContent": "The Boomer Mirage Authored by Josh Stylman via Substack, One Chart. Three Generations. Total Extraction. I saw this chart making the rounds on Twitter this week, and it stopped me cold. While the specific figures combine data from multiple sources, the trend is undeniable: in 1950, over half of 30-year-olds were married homeowners. By 2025, some analysts project that number as low as 13%. That's not a societal transformation. It's not an economic fluke. It's the visible outcome of an invisible strategy—one that extracted everything it could from a three-generation arc and left only illusions in its place. They'll tell you people just choose differently now—that marriage rates fell because of changing values. But people can't choose what they can't afford. When the economic foundation for family formation disappears, cultural changes follow inevitably. That chart doesn't show us changing values or new priorities. It shows systemic breakdown, disguised for decades as freedom. It maps the slow evaporation of the social contract. For one generation, adulthood was a starting point. For the next, a struggle. For the latest, an abstraction—marketed endlessly but almost never attained. What began as a rite of passage has become a paywalled simulation. The post–World War II boom was never sustainable. In hindsight, this was obvious. It relied on conditions that were always time-limited: cheap energy from newly tapped oil fields, industrial monopolies before globalization kicked in, dollar hegemony that exported inflation globally, and a demographic pyramid with more workers than retirees. It was a golden window, not a golden age. And when the window closed, the illusion had to be maintained—through leverage, narrative, and ever-increasing sacrifice from the generations that followed. The math quietly stopped working. Boomers bought homes for two or three times their annual income during an era when interest rates would fall for the next four decades—turning their mortgages into wealth-building machines as rates dropped from 15% to near-zero. Today's buyers face five to six times their income—or more in major cities—while rates can only go up from historic lows. Where Boomers rode a 40-year tailwind of falling borrowing costs that inflated their assets while deflated their debt, current generations face headwinds at every turn. The Federal Reserve data confirms this unprecedented decline, showing rates falling from over 18% in the early 1980s to near 2.6% by 2021. The housing market itself tells the story: recent data shows over 500,000 more sellers than buyers - not because homes are affordable, but because an entire generation has been systematically priced out. The institutions that promised stability—education, government, media, finance—mutated into extraction machines. Still speaking the old language, they now served a different purpose: to keep people compliant inside a system that no longer offered a way out. This wasn't merely economic. It was existential. The foundations of meaning—family, ownership, stability—were quietly downgraded to lifestyle preferences, and then systematically priced out. People without homes are easier to relocate. People without families are easier to isolate. People without rootedness are easier to govern. The Boomers didn't design the con, but they lived in its payout phase. They received land, pensions, and a functional society. Many still believe they earned it, unable to recognize how thoroughly their reality was engineered from the start. Their children were left trying to replicate a model that no longer existed. Their grandchildren have grown up in the wreckage, wondering why their competence and effort never translate into traction. This didn't happen by accident. As I've documented in The Technocratic Blueprint, we're witnessing the culmination of a century-long plan—a sophisticated pump and dump scheme where the bill is finally coming due. The architecture for this extraction has deep historical roots, dating back to systematic changes in how America was governed and how citizens were legally classified. What followed was a long, slow harvest of the population—one that disguised control as progress, debt as opportunity, and collapse as evolution. The postwar boom didn't contradict that system—it lubricated it. Now, the mirage is gone. What was once promised can no longer be afforded. The institutions that upheld the illusion are spent. They extract, but no longer inspire. They preach equity while enforcing dependence. They sell empowerment while removing agency. And still, they insist the dream is alive. But here's where the extraction becomes truly sophisticated. As the traditional American Dream died, a new form of participation emerged: digital membership in what amounts to a global dollar club. As KF recently explained in his analysis of the GENIUS Act, stablecoins—digital bank accounts disguised as innovation—have exploded to serve 400 million users globally while generating massive profits for their issuers. The trade-off is stark. Boomers got real assets with relative transactional privacy. The next generation gets digital \"assets\"—stablecoin wallets, app-based banking, algorithmic financial services—in exchange for comprehensive surveillance. What looks like financial inclusion is actually the infrastructure for total economic monitoring. This represents the systematic replacement of real value with declared value across every domain. America has become a \"club promoter\" for the global dollar system, offering relaxed entry requirements that have drawn hundreds of billions into U.S. treasury-backed stablecoins. Users get access to \"dollar-denominated wealth\" through stablecoins that pay them no interest while the issuers pocket billions from the treasury yields. It's the same extraction model that's been systematically engineered through culture and media for decades, just scaled globally and digitized. Experts in these systems, like Aaron Day, warn this represents a \"backdoor CBDC\"—applying existing financial surveillance laws to what was previously private money. The surveillance trade-off is particularly insidious. In the short term, these systems offer less monitoring than traditional banks—no extensive paperwork, minimal identity verification. But once everyone is locked into the digital infrastructure, America can impose far stricter controls than ever before. Every transaction becomes trackable, every account becomes freezable, every economic participant becomes manageable. We're witnessing the replacement of physical ownership with digital access—and calling it progress. Where Boomers built equity in homes, the next generation builds balances in accounts that can be monitored, modified, or eliminated with keystrokes. But charts don't lie. That one chart—the brutal slope from 52% to 13%—says what no institution will admit: the old system is dead. It wasn't lost. It was liquidated—and we were the product. What gets built in its place remains an open question. The GENIUS Act's full-reserve model could enable either unprecedented control—or the first real challenge to fractional-reserve banking in a century. But as Catherine Austin Fitts has pointed out, the Act contains no protections against programmable money, potentially creating private CBDCs with even less oversight than government-issued digital currency. As she explains, 'the issuing is not centralized, it's dispersed. But if you look at the control mechanism of a social credit system and we know the federal government is doing remarkable things to pull together all the data they need to do a social credit system controlled by private corporations, tech companies, essentially.' The outcome isn't predetermined—it's being decided right now. The good news is that once the spell breaks, you stop trying to win the rigged game. You stop competing for scraps and start building something real. Not a nostalgic replica of a world that's gone—but a new structure, grounded in truth, agency, and actual sovereignty. The chart that documents the death of the old dream becomes the blueprint for something better—if we're honest enough to read what it's really telling us. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 21:45",

    "fullContent": "Russia's Fuel Exports Plummeted in July By Charles Kennedy of OilPrice.com Shipments of refined petroleum products out of Russia declined by 6.6% in July from the previous month, Reuters estimates showed on Wednesday, as domestic demand rose and capacity under planned maintenance increased. Port of Murmansk Russian seaborne fuel exports fell to 8.67 million metric tons last month, with shipments from the Baltic ports, the Black Sea and Sea of Azov ports, and the Arctic Murmansk and Arkhangelsk ports all down in July compared to June. Only the fuel shipments from the Far Eastern ports rose in July from a month earlier as most maintenance works at refineries in the area were completed, according to the data provided by industry sources and calculated by Reuters. Going forward, Russia’s refined product shipments could fall further in August, while crude oil exports could rise, as several refineries sustained damages during Ukrainian drone strikes earlier this month. A Sunday drone attack on the Saratov refinery, owned by Russia’s oil giant Rosneft, prompted the facility to halt the intake of crude oil, a source with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg on Monday. The Saratov Refinery in the Volga region has the capacity to process 140,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, but it has now been forced offline due to Ukrainian drone strikes. The refinery has become the third Russian crude processing facility to have been damaged by Ukrainian drone strikes so far in August. The halt to three major refineries would mean that Russia will see lower domestic gasoline and diesel supply while it will have more crude available for export as it doesn’t have too much storage for the unprocessed crude. Last week, reports emerged that Russia is preparing to sharply increase crude oil exports this month after Ukrainian drone strikes disabled major refineries, prompting a shift toward western port shipments. Crude shipments from Russia’s western ports could increase to 2 million bpd in August, about 200,000 bpd more than previously planned, sources told Reuters last week.

    "fullContent": "Sex On The Moon: Inside NASA's Most Unusual $21 Million Heist In July 2002, 24-year-old NASA intern Thad Roberts — a triple major in physics, geology, and geophysics at the University of Utah — carried out one of NASA’s most audacious thefts. Struggling financially and supporting a wife back home, Roberts devised what he believed was a foolproof plan: steal a 600-pound safe from Houston’s Johnson Space Center containing lunar samples from every Apollo mission and a meteorite, together valued at $21 million, according to the NY Post. His first step was finding a buyer. With help from friend Gordon McWhorter, Roberts connected online with a Belgian interested in paying $1,000–$5,000 per gram. The buyer, however, alerted the FBI, which told him to keep talking while agents investigated. Around this time, Roberts began a whirlwind romance with 22-year-old NASA intern Tiffany Fowler. After just three weeks of dating, Roberts told her about the plan — and she agreed to help. They recruited another intern, Shae Saur, and one night used their NASA IDs to slip into the lab and wheel out the entire safe. The NY Post writes that at a hotel, they sawed it open. On July 20, the 33rd anniversary of the first moon landing, Roberts and Fowler drove to Orlando to meet associates of the “buyer.” While waiting, Roberts hid moon rocks under the bed covers. Roberts (Photo: NY Post) “I take some of the moon rocks and I put them underneath the blanket on the bed … I never said anything but I’m sure she could feel it,” he told CBS News in 2012. “It was more about the symbol of what we were doing, basically having sex on the moon. It’s more uncomfortable than not, but it wasn’t about the comfort at that point. It was about the expression. And no one had ever had sex on the moon before. I think we can safely say that.” When the meeting came, it wasn’t buyers waiting — it was undercover FBI agents. The rocks were recovered, but the FBI said they were now “virtually useless to the scientific community,” and the theft also destroyed 30 years of a NASA scientist’s handwritten research notes. After his arrest, Roberts admitted to also stealing dinosaur bones and fossils from the Natural History Museum in Salt Lake City. “We weren’t going to take this money we were getting from it to go buy a yacht or lots of cars or a big house,” he told CBS. “We were gonna live just the small kind of lifestyle we were, but fund science that might change the world, you know?” Roberts, Fowler, and Saur pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit theft and interstate transportation of stolen property. Roberts got eight years in federal prison, serving six; Fowler and Saur each received 180 days of house arrest and 150 hours of community service. McWhorter, convicted at trial, was sentenced to six years. Roberts and Fowler never saw each other again. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 20:30",

    "fullContent": "French Fries Versus Baked Potatoes: One Raises Diabetes Risk 20 Percent, The Other Doesn't Authored by Rachel Ann T. Melegrito via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Potatoes have long had a bad rap for being high in carbs. A new study backs that concern—at least in part. That weekly french fry habit could be setting you up for diabetes decades down the road. Research found that eating french fries just three times a week may significantly raise Type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk—but, surprisingly, other potato preparations showed no increased risk at all. RaraAvisPhoto/Shutterstock “Our findings suggest it’s not fair to put all potatoes in the same basket,” lead author Seyed Mohammad Mousavi told The Epoch Times. How You Like Your Potatoes Matters The study, led by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, tracked more than 205,000 adults across three major U.S. observational health studies for 30 years. Participants regularly reported what they ate, along with details about their health and lifestyle. The study found that every three extra servings of potatoes per week was associated with a 5 percent increase in T2D risk. For french fries, that jump was even higher—20 percent per three servings. In contrast, eating baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes was not associated with an increased risk, suggesting that french fries are the main driver behind the link between potatoes and diabetes. French fries are often loaded with salt, which can raise blood pressure and trigger inflammation, increasing the risk of T2D. However, it’s more than just the fat and salt content driving the diabetes risk. “French fries are typically deep-fried at very high temperatures, which can produce harmful compounds,” Mousavi said. One such compound is acrylamide, formed during browning and linked to inflammation, insulin resistance, and blood vessel damage. “Due to their deep-fried nature, they [fries] are also much higher in calories than baked or mashed potatoes,” said Melissa Mitri, a registered dietitian-nutritionist and owner of Melissa Mitri Nutrition, who was not involved in the study. The large amounts of oil used in frying also introduce trans fats, which further increase insulin resistance and inflammation. Combined with the high-temperature cooking that breaks down resistant starches, french fries become a perfect storm for blood sugar chaos. Potatoes and T2D Even outside of french fries, people who ate seven or more servings of potatoes per week had a 12 percent higher risk of developing T2D. The risk rose with greater intake. While preparation plays a key role in how potatoes affect diabetes risk, it’s worth noting they still have a high glycemic index, meaning they can rapidly raise blood sugar. Potatoes are a common source of carbohydrates, especially starch, which the body quickly breaks down into sugar. Because of this, eating potatoes can cause a sharp rise in blood sugar levels soon after a meal. Frequent blood sugar spikes force the pancreas to release more insulin repeatedly. Over time, this constant demand can cause insulin-producing cells to wear out or stop working properly. This contributes to insulin resistance and reduced insulin production—both key drivers of T2D. A potato’s glycemic index, which ranks how quickly and how much foods raise blood sugar levels after eating, depends on how they’re prepared. A higher glycemic diet is associated with an increased risk of developing T2D because the foods cause a rapid and significant rise in glucose levels. Mashed and boiled potatoes have higher glycemic indexes because cooking breaks down their structure and makes the starch easier to digest, leading to faster spikes in blood sugar. Deep frying also softens the starch inside, but the hot oil forms a crust with some resistant starch that slows digestion. The fat in fries also helps slow down how quickly sugar is absorbed, making their glycemic index a bit lower than mashed or instant potatoes. Using different food preparation methods can reduce potatoes’ risks: Chill potatoes after cooking to increase their resistant starch content, slowing digestion and causing a more balanced rise in blood sugar. Bake or boil potatoes with the skin to retain more fiber and micronutrients. Boil, bake, or roast potatoes with minimal oil instead of frying to avoid added fats. Air fry potatoes to reduce the formation of harmful compounds produced by deep frying. Replacing potatoes with other carbohydrates reduced T2D risk. Swapping mashed, boiled, or baked potatoes for whole grains like pasta, bread, or farro lowered diabetes risk by 4 percent, while replacing french fries cut it by 19 percent. Substituting fries with whole grains, legumes, brown rice, or vegetables also reduced risk by 19 percent. The only swap that increased risk was white rice, which was linked to a 3 percent higher risk of T2D. This may be because white rice has a high glycemic index. “White rice is stripped of fiber and nutrients, digests quickly, and causes sharper spikes in blood sugar,” Mousavi said. Whole grains have fiber that slows digestion and causes smaller blood sugar spikes. Effects Surface Years Later Perhaps most concerning, the study found that potato intake 12 to 20 years before diagnosis had the strongest association with diabetes risk—suggesting dietary choices in your 20s and 30s could determine your health in your 50s and 60s. Type 2 diabetes develops gradually, with insulin resistance and inflammation starting decades before symptoms appear. Who’s Most at Risk Even after adjusting for genetics, diet, and lifestyle, the link between french fries and diabetes remained strong. It was especially pronounced in people with higher body mass index (BMI) and in white participants. Mitri noted that excess weight is tied to inflammation. “Someone with a higher BMI may have more difficulty responding to insulin,” she said, which can worsen insulin resistance. “So for people with higher BMI, the same amount of potatoes may have a bigger impact on diabetes risk,” Mousavi said. The study also found that people who ate more potatoes often took in more calories, sugary drinks, and red meat, and were less physically active—factors that can raise diabetes risk.

    "fullContent": "US Reactivates Military Intelligence Unit On Korean Peninsula In Latest Build-Up Via The Libertarian Institute The Pentagon activated a military intelligence unit in South Korea. The move comes after the US established a second fighter \"super squadron\" on the Korean Peninsula. According to a statement from the US Army, the 528th Military Intelligence Company (MICO) is now operating in South Korea. The 528th will be part of the Second Infantry Division. US Army file image \"2ID is the last remaining permanently forward-stationed division in the U.S. Army. Its purpose is to deter aggression and maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula, and if deterrence fails, ‘Fight Tonight’ in support of the U.S.-Republic of Korea Alliance,\" the Army’s statement explained. The 528th was established during World War II and deployed to the Korean Peninsula during the Korean War. The 528th was disbanded in 2005, after deployments during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. According to the statement, the MICO will be \"utilized to collect, analyze, and disseminate information about enemy forces, terrain, and potential threats to support decision-making and ensure mission success.\" The reestablishment of the military intelligence company follows the Pentagon repositioning dozens of F-16s in South Korea closer to the demilitarized zone. Additionally, Washington and Seoul are set to kick off large-scale war games that often lead to a spike in tensions on the Korean Peninsula. However, the US and South Korea agreed to divide the war games, and will conduct half of the planned military exercises in September. Last month, Pyongyang said it was not interested in bilateral talks with Seoul, but was open to talks with Washington so long as the US dropped its demand for North Korean denuclearization.
