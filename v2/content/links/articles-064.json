    "summary": "- by New Deal democratMuch of the commentary on yesterday’s CPI report suggested that the tariff impacts were apparent. My own analysis was more cautious. That’s simply because we don’t know for sure which items were affected by tariffs, and at this point referring to, e.g., appliances that showed relatively large monthly increases in prices is speculative - not wrong, mind you, simply speculative. The closest to rigorous analysis I read was that goods inflation was more than services inflation, which would make sense because few “services” can be imported.That issue continued into this morning’s report on June producer prices.Headline PPI was reported this morning to have been unchanged for June, while that for raw commodities increased 0.6%. Still, as shown by the below, the YoY trend in each is hardly that of accelerating inflation. Final demand PPI was up 2.4% YoY, continuing its cooling trend, while that for commodities was up 1.7%, in line with its trend for the past 12 months:Wh",

    "summary": "Cody KallenRising geopolitical tensions and supply chain vulnerabilities have driven recent fragmentation of foreign direct investment (FDI). This paper provides systematic evidence of FDI fragmentation along ideological and geographic lines across five dimensions: shifting away from ideologically distant countries (ideological sorting), prioritizing politically aligned countries (friendshoring), reducing exposure to specific high-risk countries (derisking), moving production closer to the home country (nearshoring), and returning investment to the home country (reshoring). Measures of FDI based on financial transactions reveal evidence of ideological sorting and nearshoring. The capital expenditures of multinational enterprises and their affiliates display ideological sorting, derisking, nearshoring, and reshoring. Cross-border M&A deals reflect patterns of derisking, while horizontal (but not vertical) M&A exhibits broader ideological realignment. At the industry level, derisking and",

Shortly after the Russian attack, the projected cost (cumulative over six years) stood at $2.44 trillion for the region. Professional forecasters predicted a dramatic increase in macroeconomic uncertainty, significant spillover effects, some hysteresis effects as well as a changing nature of business cycles. We also use the war shock to study how professional forecasters acquire and process information. Our results point to state dependence as well as an important role of forward information in shaping macroeconomic outlook of professional forecasters.",
