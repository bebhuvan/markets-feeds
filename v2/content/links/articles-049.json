    "fullContent": "Global Food Prices Marching Higher Serves As Warning For 'Fragile States' The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' Food Price Index, a global benchmark for food commodity prices, registered its highest level since early 2023 in July. This marks a notable inflection point after a multi-year downward trend that followed the Covid and Russia-Ukraine war price spikes. The FAO Food Price Index averaged 130.1 in July, up 1.6% from June, driven primarily by sharp increases in meat and vegetable oil prices. \"The index tracks monthly changes in the international prices of a set of globally traded food commodities. In July, price increases in the meat and vegetable oil indices more than offset declines in the cereal, dairy and sugar indices,\" FAO wrote in its monthly report. The FAO Food Price Index has undergone a significant reversal since bottoming out in early 2024, following a downturn after the price spikes during Covid and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It is now at its highest level since February 2023, up 43% from its early Covid-era lows, and will likely remain elevated into next year. Here's a summary of the report: Headline Index: Averaged 130.1 (+1.6% MoM), driven by meat and vegetable oils. Still 18.8% below the March 2022 peak but 7.6% above July 2024. Cereals (106.5, -0.8% MoM): Wheat & sorghum prices fell on new harvests; maize & barley rose. Rice (-1.8%) declined on ample supply and weak demand. Vegetable Oils (166.8, +7.1% MoM): 3-year high. Palm oil up on strong demand; soy oil supported by biofuel sector; sunflower oil higher on Black Sea supply tightness; rapeseed oil down on new EU crop. Meat (127.3, +1.2% MoM): Record high. Bovine & ovine prices surged on China/U.S. demand; poultry edged higher as Brazil regained AI-free status; pig meat fell on oversupply & weak EU demand. Dairy (155.3, -0.1% MoM): First drop since April 2024. Butter & milk powders down on abundant supply; cheese prices up on strong Asia/Near East demand & tighter EU exports. Sugar (103.3, -0.2% MoM): Fifth monthly decline on expectations of 2025/26 production rebound (Brazil, India, Thailand), partly offset by recovering import demand. Last month's uptick signals increasing price momentum in global food markets. While the index remains well below its 160 peak in 2022, sustained upward pressure in global food prices could reignite inflationary pressures. Implications: Fragile States: A renewed price surge could spark food insecurity and social unrest in low-income, import-dependent nations. In the U.S., the Trump administration needs to place a larger emphasis on strengthening local food supply chains to mitigate external supply shocks. That means know your local rancher and farmer, as well as make plans for a backyard garden and chicken coop. Readers have been well-informed about this inflection point...

    "fullContent": "5 Things To Know About Trump's Order Banning Political Debanking Authored by Kevin Stocklin via The Epoch Times, President Donald Trump’s executive order banning politicized debanking is intended to reverse what some analysts say is a trend of banks and payment services refusing service to people and companies for political, religious, or ideological reasons. Advocates against political debanking cite cases of Christians and conservatives who they say have been victims of this process. This includes allegations by Christian organizations including Tennessee-based nonprofit Indigenous Advance Ministries, as well as Sam Brownback, the chairman of the National Committee for Religious Freedom (NCRF), and the president himself. Speaking to bank executives at the World Economic Forum in January, Trump said, “I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America.” Many conservative groups expressed support for this executive order. “Everyone needs access to basic financial services,” Brian Knight, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a leading advocate against ideological debanking, told The Epoch Times. “No American should have to worry that they could lose their bank account or have a payment declined because of their religious or political beliefs.” Banks have denied that they have taken part in political debanking. “We don’t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed,” Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase, told The Epoch Times in a statement. “We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right.” A Bank of America spokesperson told The Epoch Times in January: “We serve more than 70 million clients and we welcome conservatives. We are required to follow extensive government rules and regulations that sometimes result in decisions to exit client relationships. We never close accounts for political reasons and don’t have a political litmus test.” The Southern Poverty Law Center, a left-wing advocacy group, criticized efforts by groups including Alliance Defending Freedom, calling them “an ongoing crusade to force private businesses to adhere to conservative Christian theology, in part by spreading the false narrative that private sector banks have been dropping conservative religious clients since the Obama administration.” Trump’s executive order seeks to reorient federal regulators and law enforcement away from practices that may have supported political debanking and toward actions that will actively oppose it. Here are five key takeaways from the order. 1. Regulators Drop ‘Reputational Risk’ The order directs federal regulators to stop using criteria such as “reputational risk,” which some banks say have been used to pressure them to cancel customers whose political or religious views government officials don’t like. Some concerned shareholders say that banks that consider political views in deciding who they will serve also creates risks. One case in point, says Jerry Bowyer, CEO of Bowyer Research and an advocate for shareholders and customers against political debanking, is Trump’s allegation that several banks closed his accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the Capitol. “Just think about that—you debanked someone who might be the President of the United States,” Bowyer told The Epoch Times. “That doesn’t sound like risk management to me; that sounds like courting risk.” “Turns out that it was,” he said. Bank regulators have already taken steps to remove “reputational risk” from their criteria. In June, the Federal Reserve announced that reputational risk will no longer be a component of its bank supervision process, and said it was working with other regulatory agencies to assist them in also dropping this criterion. 2. Investigations of Unlawful Debanking to Commence The executive order requires federal banking regulators to investigate complaints of political debanking and pass any cases on to the U.S. attorney general’s office. Penalties for violations could include fines and consent decrees, as well as reinstating any customers who were unlawfully cancelled. This could include not only persons who have been refused service for ideological reasons but also companies. Operation Choke Point, which was enacted under the Obama administration, was a case in which regulators allegedly pressured banks to refuse service to industries like gun retailers and payday lenders, treating them as high-risk entities. A more recent version of this was Citibank’s policy, which started in 2018 but ended in June of this year, to refuse banking services to gun stores that sold to customers under the age of 21, which effectively prohibited business with much of the industry. 3. Financial Privacy Also a Focus Trump’s executive order also urges a federal investigation into alleged warrantless data mining of customers’ accounts by Bank of America (BOA) to hand over information to law enforcement regarding customers who traveled to Washington D.C., shopped at sporting goods stores that sold guns like Bass Pro Shops or Cabela’s, or expressed conservative political views during the 2021 Capitol breach. In May 2023, U.S. House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) issued a letter to BOA CEO Brian Moynihan that stated an FBI whistleblower charged that the bank “provided the FBI—voluntarily and without any legal process—with a list of individuals who had made transactions in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area with a BoA credit or debit card between January 5 and January 7, 2021,” and highlighted customers who bought firearms with a BOA credit card. 4. SBA to Reinstate Religious Organizations Trump’s executive order also instructs the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to reinstate clients who have been denied loans or other services for political reasons. Previously, the SBA had prohibited any group that was “principally engaged in teaching, instructing, counseling, or indoctrinating religion” from applying for Economic Injury Disaster Loans. The SBA ended this policy in July, in compliance with a 2016 Supreme Court decision in the case Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, which stated that excluding religious organizations from government programs was a violation of the First Amendment. 5. State ‘Fair Access’ Laws Several states have recently passed “fair access” banking laws that prohibit denying financial services by banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions on political or religious grounds. Florida enacted such a law in 2023, and Tennessee did so in 2024. Similar laws have been introduced in state legislatures in Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, and South Dakota, according to a legal analysis by law firm Latham & Watkins. The firm stated that critics of laws against political debanking “see such initiatives as an attack on environmental, social, and corporate-governance (ESG) policies in the financial system.” Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 19:15",

    "fullContent": "How Much Power Do Data Centers Use? Data center demand is rising at a break neck speed, with little signs of slowing. As the electricity consumption of AI rises, by 2028, a projected 12% of U.S. electricity demand could be driven from data centers. Beyond America, countries are pouring billions into AI sovereignty efforts which require data center facilities running 24/7 to power them. This graphic, via Visual Capitalist's Dorothy Neufeld, shows data center demand as a share of total power consumption, based on data from the IEA. The Boom in Data Center Demand Here is the share of each region’s total power demand that is driven by center centers: As we can see, America’s data center demand leads globally, at 8.9% of total power consumption. In Virginia, data centers account for 26% of the state’s total power consumption—or nearly triple the national average. This year, the state’s leading utility firm expects to connect 15 new data centers given surging demand. As big tech ramps up AI spending, a significant share is being funnelled into massive data centers along with the energy sources that power them. In particular, demand for nuclear is expanding at the fastest rate in decades. By comparison, data centers comprise 4.8% of the total power share in the European Union and 2.3% in China. To learn more about this topic from a global perspective, check out this graphic on the growth of data center capacity worldwide since 2005. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 18:50",

    "fullContent": "Most COVID Lung Abnormalities Heal Over Time, New Guidelines Confirm Authored by Rachel Ann T. Melegrito via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Up to half of hospitalized COVID-19 patients show lung abnormalities on chest CT scans long after the acute infection is over. Many fear these changes mean lasting damage or worsening lung disease. However, new guidelines on treating long COVID confirm that lung abnormalities usually stabilize or even improve over time. Magic mine/ShutterStock “The lungs are an organ, like skin, that are in constant contact with the environment. Because of that, they have a significant amount of stem cells in reserve and cells ready for healing,” Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, a pulmonary and critical care medicine physician and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine, told The Epoch Times. Recovery Takes Time Researchers found that in patients with lung damage following a COVID-19 infection, around 90 percent who continued to show lung abnormalities at the time of hospital discharge began to see improvements one to three years after infection. After a COVID-19 infection, roughly six in 100 people are estimated to develop persistent symptoms that can last for months to years—a condition known as long COVID. Common complaints include fatigue, joint and muscle aches, breathlessness, headaches, and difficulty concentrating, often called “brain fog.” Symptoms typically improve over time—usually within four to nine months. Lung recovery tends to follow a similar trajectory. After infection, the lungs can show changes that resemble scarring—such as inflammation, collapsed air sacs, or temporary thickening of lung tissue—but these often heal on their own, Dr. Joseph Varon, president and chief medical officer of Independent Medical Alliance, who is not one of the authors of the treatment guideline, told The Epoch Times. Based on Varon’s clinical experience, most patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-related lung issues show improvement on scans and of symptoms within three to six months. However, he noted that some people, especially older adults or those who had severe illness, can have lingering lung changes or symptoms for a year or more. In COVID-19, the early lung damage is mostly due to inflammation, not permanent destruction, he said. Once the infection clears and inflammation goes down, the lungs can start to heal, absorbing fluid and repairing tissue, a process that can take several months. “The body has the capacity to heal,” Dr. Pierre Kory, founder of Leading Edge Clinic, which treats long COVID patients, told The Epoch Times. COVID is typically an acute illness that heals over time rather than a chronic inflammatory condition—though in some cases, lingering lung inflammation or fibrosis can persist, he said. Many post-COVID lung changes seen in scans are not signs of permanent damage. They often reflect the lung’s natural healing process after inflammation, similar to what’s seen in other viral pneumonias or recovery from acute respiratory distress syndrome. Over time, these abnormalities often fade as the tissue repairs itself. Unlike chronic conditions such as interstitial lung disease, which involve ongoing triggers and progressive scarring, post-COVID changes are typically non-progressive. However, older patients who had been on mechanical ventilation or had severe or critical initial infection were more likely to have persistent lung changes, possibly due to the extent of initial lung injury. Residual Signs Versus Permanent Damage Chest CT scans often reveal lung changes long after COVID-19 infection that may look severe on imaging. These include ground glass opacities, which are hazy areas suggesting inflammation, or fibrous strands, thin bands of tissue left over from healing. However, many of these findings are residual effects from the infection, not signs of irreversible damage. “Radiologic findings often lag behind clinical recovery and must be interpreted within a broader clinical framework,” said Varon, “I have seen patients that have ‘white lungs’ for months and are doing well.” The disconnect between imaging and the actual patient condition may lead to confusion, unnecessary follow-up, or even overtreatment of long COVID. “Some patients report persistent symptoms despite near-normal imaging,” Varon said, likely due to lingering viral effects or nervous system issues rather than actual lung damage. “The key takeaway is that both lung damage and symptoms often improve—but not always in synchrony, and not always completely,” he said. That’s why an individualized, symptom-based follow-up approach remains essential in managing long COVID patients. Preventing Costly Overtreatment The new guidelines specifically address the tendency to over-interpret nonspecific findings as signs of progressive lung disease. The new consensus advises using CT only when clinically indicated, such as in patients with persistent or worsening respiratory symptoms. Mislabeling can also lead to costly treatments, repeated imaging, and even affect life insurance or disability claims. “These medications can cost up to $60,000 per year—and patients may not really need them,” Varon said. The new guidelines suggest providers request follow-up chest CT only in patients whose respiratory symptoms persist or worsen three months after infection, with those symptoms lasting at least two months and with no other identifiable cause. They also recommend low-dose protocols for follow-up imaging to reduce radiation exposure. CT was invaluable early in the pandemic, especially when RT-PCR testing was unreliable, Varon said, but its continued use in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic long COVID patients is often unnecessary. The guidelines also urge radiologists to avoid using terms such as “fibrosis” or “interstitial lung disease,” which often imply progressive or permanent scarring, when describing nonspecific residual findings. The bigger concern, Kory said, is the tendency to over-label nonspecific findings, like ground-glass opacities or mild fibrotic changes, as definitive signs of fibrotic interstitial lung disease. “I see this in my practice every single day,” he said. “These interpretations can trigger unnecessary anxiety, inappropriate referrals, and misguided treatment plans.” Kory takes a symptom-focused approach, monitoring patients clinically and repeating imaging only if conditions worsen. “My experience in general is that yes, most things in medicine are overused, including imaging,” he said.

    "fullContent": "​​​​​​​Gun Sales Fall Under 1 Million For First Time In Six Years; Ammo Prices Sink To Lows After years of pandemic-fueled surges and politically driven buying sprees, the U.S. gun market is sliding deeper into a downturn. With Republicans controlling both Congress and the White House, fears of sweeping federal gun bans from far-left Democrats have abated, stripping away one of the industry's most reliable sales catalysts. The latest July figures from the FBI show 1.94 million National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) background checks, down 4.2% from July 2024. After removing permit-related checks, the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) estimated 978,731 checks directly tied to gun sales, an 8.1% drop year-over-year and the first sub-million reading in six years. \"Summer months routinely show lower background check figures than other times of the year, and we've watched as the background check figures came down from astronomical highs several years ago,\" Mark Oliva, public affairs officer with the NSSF, told firearms website Guns.com via an emailed response. Oliva noted, \"There are factors that contribute to this, including relief of concern that politics would deny some from being able to exercise Second Amendment rights to purchase a firearm of one's choice and economic uncertainty.\" The gun panic-buying frenzy of 2020 and 2021 was never sustainable and has since ended in a complete bust for the industry. Notably, the downturn is likely to persist through President Trump's second term, given that a pro-2A administration won't infringe on gun owners, unlike the Biden-Harris regime, which aggressively did so. Nowhere is the gun bust more evident than in the decline of Smith & Wesson's shares: SWBI vs. NICS...

Bill Essayli posted on the social platform X after the raid. “The enforcement of federal law is not negotiable and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.” Messages were sent to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security seeking details on the raid, including how many people were arrested. U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Greg Bovino reposted Fox News reports of Monday’s arrests on X, calling the action “Operation Trojan Horse.” Breaking: DHS arrives in Penske trucks at a Home Depot in McArthur Park area of LA for early morning immigration enforcement.

A spokesperson for Penske Truck Rental said the company was looking into the use of its vehicles by federal officials, saying its regulations prohibit transporting people in truck cargo areas. “The company was not made aware that its trucks would be used in today’s operation and did not authorize this,” spokesperson Randolph P. Ryerson said in an email. “Penske will reach out to DHS and reinforce its policy to avoid improper use of its vehicles in the future.” Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 17:40",

    "fullContent": "Epstein's Butler Of 18 Years Breaks Silence: 'No Way He Killed Himself’ The longtime butler of Jeffrey Epstein is speaking out about the death of the deceased pedophile and disgraced financier, joining the chorus of voices expressing disbelief that he committed suicide. Valdson Vieira Cotrin, who oversaw Epstein's residence in Paris for 18 years, made the admission in an interview with The Telegraph. \"I am like his brother [Mark Epstein]. I don't believe this was suicide. He loved life too much,\" Cotrin told the British newspaper. JUST IN - The Telegraph has posted a photo of Jeffrey Epstein on his private jet in 2019. This photo, may be one of the last taken of the financier, shows him wearing an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) sweatshirt, The Telegraph reports pic.twitter.com/hpJyxdHUoD — Insider Paper (@TheInsiderPaper) August 8, 2025 Cotrin described his final encounter with Epstein, painting a picture of a man who appeared far from suicidal. Epstein was relaxed and discussing future plans, including additional investments in his islands, having discreetly purchased a second property that Cotrin had visited, and spending more time in Paris. \"I drove him to Le Bourget airport. It was a Saturday, because on Monday he was supposed to appear before the judge regarding all these accusations,\" the longtime servant said. The gravity of the situation became clear shortly after Epstein's departure, according to Cotrin. \"When I got home, two young women rang, his main girlfriend who had been with him officially for several years, Karyna [Shuliak] and another who worked for him. And then they told me, 'Mr Epstein has gone to prison. He arrived in New York. The police were waiting for him'.\" Cotrin also claimed that he worked dozens of times at Epstein's properties in New York, Palm Beach, Florida and on Little St James, Epstein's private Caribbean island, dubbed by the media as \"pedophile island,\" where he is said to have trapped and raped often underage victims. \"He trusted me completely,\" said Cotrin, who has not worked since his boss's death six years ago, adding that he never saw Epstein commit any sex crimes. \"I was his chauffeur, his cook, his housekeeper. I did everything in Paris, I was his only full-time, paid-up employee and worked for him from 2001 until his death. If someone could have seen something, it's Valdson, there's no one else,\" he said. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on August 10, 2019, at 6:30 a.m., hanging from his bed. The shadowy investor was pronounced dead at New York Downtown Hospital at 6:39 a.m. The Department of Justice and the New York City medical examiner ruled his death a suicide by hanging. However, Mark Epstein, the brother of Jeffrey Epstein, has consistently rejected the government's conclusion and repeatedly stated that he does not believe his brother took his own life. \"I believe he was killed because I believe that, a day after he died, and I heard on CNN that he was found dead from assumed suicide,\" Mark Epstein said. \"They came out of the autopsy and they both concurred that this looked more like a homicide than a suicide.\" The autopsy findings have become a key source of dispute. Epstein's autopsy was performed by New York City's Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson and a pathologist hired by the Epstein family, Dr. Michael Baden. JUST IN - New photo surfaces of Bill Clinton with Epstein’s butler aboard Epstein’s private jet - The Telegraph pic.twitter.com/LboTnrFkSL — Insider Paper (@TheInsiderPaper) August 8, 2025 Mark Epstein has pointed to specific forensic evidence that he believes contradicts the suicide ruling. \"One of the major things was the three broken bones in his neck. Now, Dr. Baden has done about 500 autopsies. He's been doing this for over 50 years. And I've spoken to other pathologists and they say, you know, on a soft hanging. Which is supposedly what Jeffrey was supposed to have done. You know, you might get a broken bone, maybe two, but no one's ever seen three broken bones in this kind of hanging,\" Mark Epstein said. Earlier July, the joint DOJ-FBI memo declared an \"exhaustive review\" of evidence from Epstein's death definitively ruled out murder. The agencies also denied the existence of a \"client list\" tied to Epstein, directly contradicting earlier remarks by Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi had previously suggested on Fox News that such a list was \"sitting on my desk\" for review, igniting speculation about Epstein's possible blackmailing of globalist elites. Trump has repeatedly sought to dismiss the scandal, accusing Democrats of fabricating a hoax around Epstein to thwart his agenda. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 17:20",

    "fullContent": "DOJ To Expunge Employees' COVID-19 Vaccination Records: Lawyers Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), The government has agreed to a settlement that involves expunging records showing the COVID-19 vaccination status of employees, lawyers representing workers who sued said on Aug. 7. Officials must expunge the records under the settlement and bar discrimination based on vaccine status, Feds for Freedom, the workers group, and its lawyers said in a statement. An email to the Department of Justice attorney who filed a voluntary dismissal in the case on Thursday returned a message saying he is on leave until Aug. 11. The department’s media office did not respond to a request for comment by publication time. The formal settlement has not been entered on the court docket, but lawyers for Feds for Freedom said it includes the reimbursement of some of the legal fees incurred in the case the organization brought against the government over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal workers. Feds for Freedom sued the government in 2021, after President Joe Biden imposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements on all federal workers. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown entered a preliminary injunction in January 2022 that blocked the mandate as the case proceeded, finding that Biden lacked the authority to issue such a mandate. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit several months later lifted the injunction, saying the federal workers who sued should have taken their complaints to an administrative board rather than the courts. The full appeals court in 2023 kept the mandate in place. The Supreme Court in late 2023 vacated the rulings in the case because Biden had rescinded the mandate, meaning none of the decisions will serve as precedent in future cases. Brown in March vacated the injunction. He also directed the government and plaintiffs to file a status report. The government in filings since then requested extensions to respond, saying officials were discussing appropriate next steps for the litigation and that they were dealing with staffing issues. Brown’s last order told the parties to enter a proposed briefing schedule no later than Aug. 7. Assistant U.S. Attorney James Gillingham on Aug 7 said in a stipulation that the parties had agreed to the dismissal of the case with prejudice. Biden defended the mandate, saying it prevented infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. President Donald Trump has criticized COVID-19 vaccine mandates, saying he supported people choosing not to receive a vaccine. In February, he signed an order that bars funding to schools that require COVID-19 vaccination. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 17:00",

    "fullContent": "Hemispheric Defense: Trump Directs Military For Kinetic Ops Against Foreign Drug Cartels Per The New York Times reporting, President Trump has issued a new directive authorizing the Department of Defense (DoD) to conduct direct military operations against select Latin American drug cartels designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). This represents a major escalation in the administration's counter-cartel posture, moving beyond law enforcement and intelligence support to offensive kinetic missions. The directive, according to people familiar with the matter, provides legal cover for potential direct U.S. military operations at sea and on foreign soil, bypassing the traditional law enforcement framework. \"It signals Mr. Trump's continued willingness to use military forces to carry out what has primarily been considered a law enforcement responsibility to curb the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs,\" The New York Times wrote in the report. The move follows the deployment of active-duty and National Guard troops along the southern border, expanding surveillance via reconnaissance aircraft, and designating multiple cartels and gangs as FTOs, including Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, which the administration alleges is run by Nicolás Maduro. On Thursday, the U.S. increased its bounty on Maduro's capture to $50 million. Recently, the Treasury Department accused Cartel de los Soles of providing material support to Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. Both cartels have been designated as FTOs, which the Treasury said are \"threatening the peace and security of the United States.\" Trump administration lawyers, including the new Pentagon general counsel and head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, are expected to face early tests in determining what operations are legally permissible. NYT noted, \"Trump's new directive appears to envision a different approach, focused on U.S. forces directly capturing or killing people involved in the drug trade.\" Earlier this year, we provided readers with the understanding that the groundwork was being laid for these types of authorizations, including capture/kill missions, maritime interdictions, and cross-border SOF raids against high-value targets: USAF Spy Plane Runs SIGINT Operation Near Cabo As U.S. Preps For Potential Cartel Fight USAF Spy Jet Flies Second SIGINT Operation On US Border With Focus On Narco Hub Border Czar \"Expects\" Kinetic Warfare Between U.S. Troops & Mexican Drug Cartels U.S. Designates Mexican Cartels As \"Foreign Terrorists,\" Signaling Financial Warfare Looms US P-3B Orion Spy Plane Spotted Over Mexico As SIGINT Ops Target Cartels U.S. Special Forces Deploy To Mexico For \"Training\" Mission Following Spy Plane SIGINT Operations Trump Weighs Drone Strikes On Mexican Cartel Terrorists Amid Major Hemispheric Defense Push Trump Mulls Deploying Special Forces To Assassinate Mexican Drug Lords: Report Former Green Beret: Trump Can \"Turn Loose Delta Force\" On The Cartels Trump's target of cartels is an initiative that appears nested within a broader strategic framework referred to as \"Hemispheric Defense,\" aimed at securing the Western Hemisphere against transnational criminal gangs and Beijing. The primary objective will be to fracture cartel command-and-control nodes to disrupt fentanyl trafficking networks, particularly those dependent on precursor chemical shipments originating from China (hybrid warfare) that kill 100,000 Americans every year. It's likely that before the kinetic action begins, the U.S. Treasury will exert more financial pressure on these cartels to disrupt their financial networks. Source: Heritage Foundation If implemented, this directive marks a major doctrinal shift for the U.S. to secure the Western Hemisphere in a world fracturing into a dangerous bipolar state. There are risks that this action could spark diplomatic fallout with Mexico and other surrounding countries. Another risk is that cartels may retaliate with asymmetric attacks targeting U.S. personnel, diplomatic buildings, or infrastructure. What's worse is that the Biden-Harris regime of far-left globalists flooded the nation with cartel members. There is a coming storm. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 16:40",
