    "fullContent": "Cracks Appear In NATO Unity Ahead Of Alaska Summit On Ukraine Territorial Concessions Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk, as head of NATO's largest and most well-armed 'eastern flank' country, expressed both concern and cautious optimism on Monday ahead of the upcoming Trump-Putin summit set in Alaska, focused on the war in Ukraine. Tusk emphasized 'hope' based on Washington's assurance that it would consult its European allies before the talks. \"The US has committed to consulting with its European partners ahead of the Alaska meeting,\" Tusk told a press conference. \"I will wait to see the outcome of the talks between Presidents Trump and Putin — I have many concerns, but also some hope.\" But he also laid out, \"The West, including European countries, will not accept Russian demands which simply amount to the seizure of Ukrainian territory.\" Tusk further stressed that European leaders were united in their stance on peace negotiations, insisting that Ukraine must be actively included in any talks. But the reality and elephant in the room is that Moscow is not going to sign onto a final peace settlement and halt its special military operation for nothing short of territorial concessions. It is not going to give up its conquered territories in the Donbas, which it has already declared part of the Russian Federation. \"For Poland and our partners, it is clear: borders cannot be altered by force,\" Tursk said. \"Russia must not gain from its aggression against Ukraine.\" The rest of European leadership clearly agrees with him. \"As we work towards a sustainable and just peace, international law is clear: All temporarily occupied territories belong to Ukraine,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said. \"A sustainable peace also means that aggression cannot be rewarded.\" And yet, on Sunday NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte actually for the first time opened the door a little on the question of territorial concessions: \"In the end, the issue of the fact that the Russians are controlling at this moment, factually, a part of Ukraine has to be on the table\" in any peace talks after the Alaska summit, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on CBS on Sunday. Rutte said Ukraine’s Western backers \"can never accept that in a legal sense,\" but he suggested that they might tacitly acknowledge Russian control. He compared it to the way that the U.S. hosted the diplomatic missions of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from 1940 to 1991, \"acknowledging that the Soviet Union was controlling those territories, but never accepting (it) in a legal sense.\" He explained, \"When it comes to the entire issue of territory, when it comes to recognition, for example, perhaps in a future agreement, that Russia actually controls part of Ukrainian territory, that must be an actual recognition, not a de jure political recognition.\" Watch Turk lay down Europe's red lines on negotiations and what's at stake: Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk [@donaldtusk] has warned Russia against getting the idea it can challenge other countries’ borders “with impunity.” He made the comments during a speech at Poland’s Nitro-Chem explosives plant. He also repeated the call for no deals about Ukraine… pic.twitter.com/FyWJarnBNk — TVP World (@TVPWorld_com) August 11, 2025 Does this reflect Trump's thinking too? If there's any hope whatsoever of making headway with Putin in Alaska, this will indeed have to be on the table. Otherwise there will be no point in talking and the whole meeitng will prove futile in terms of finding a settlement. Still, what Russia will come a away with is a big diplomatic win regardless - just in the optics alone - in the fact that 'isolated' Putin is given a face-to-face bilateral summit with Trump.

    "fullContent": "Germany's Federal Employment Agency Is Promoting Welfare Benefits To Young Migrants Authored by Thomas Brooke via Remix News, Germany’s Federal Employment Agency is actively promoting the country’s “citizen’s benefit” (Bürgergeld) to young migrants, presenting it online as a straightforward and appealing option for those without work. A dedicated section of the agency’s website, written in English for “people from abroad,” features a smiling young couple — including a man in his early thirties holding a book and a woman in a hijab — under the headline: “If you are unable to finance your own living expenses, under certain circumstances the Jobcenter will support you with the citizen’s benefit.” The site outlines that the benefit is a state welfare payment for those with “no income or who do not earn enough money” to support themselves and their dependents. Basic eligibility criteria are listed plainly: “You are capable of working,” “You are at least 15 years old,” and “You live in Germany and the center of your life is here.” The guidance stresses that applicants need not be elderly or unfit for work — those under 15 or unable to work can also receive support if they are part of a “community of need” with someone who qualifies. Alongside the requirements, the website presents the process as quick and simple. A prominent red box invites visitors to “apply online,” advising them that if they already have an account, they can begin their application “immediately.” The page also sets out obligations for recipients — attending Jobcenter appointments, informing the agency of any changes in personal circumstances — but the overall tone is one of ease and accessibility. Writing in Focus, columnist Jan Fleischhauer uses the site as a starting point for a broader critique of Germany’s welfare policy toward migrants. He notes that “one in two recipients of the citizen’s benefit doesn’t have a German passport,” and says the warm, promotional tone of the agency’s online material undermines political claims that immigration is essential to sustain the social safety net. “Germany is so generous that it not only explains to immigrants from abroad how to get a job, but also how to make ends meet in Germany without one,” he writes. Fleischhauer argues that few countries would so openly market their welfare systems to newcomers, and that the policy has been “a complete success” in driving take-up among non-citizens. He points to the steady rise in costs — from €39 billion in 2022 to €47 billion in 2024 — not including accommodation and healthcare expenses. He also highlights Health Minister Nina Warken’s proposal to shift medical costs for Bürgergeld recipients out of health insurance budgets and into general taxation, claiming advocates of the benefit “fear nothing more than transparency” about the true financial burden. Remix News has reported often on the imbalance between German citizens and foreigners receiving welfare benefits. In November last year, we cited statistics from the Federal Employment Agency (BA) which showed that of the 4 million people who can work but receive social benefits in Germany, more than 2.5 million have a migration background, constituting 63.5 percent of all recipients. This group includes foreigners and those who have a foreign background, which means their parents may have been born abroad. In June, Bild reported how nearly half of Germany’s €17.68 billion in housing support for 2024 was paid out to foreigners, citing government data. The money, distributed under the citizen’s benefit system, was used to cover rent, heating, operating costs, and deposits for low-income residents. Of the total, €8.15 billion went to people without German citizenship, even though they make up just around 15 percent of the population. The remaining €9.53 billion went to German citizens — this includes German-born individuals and those born elsewhere who have become naturalized. Following its electoral success, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) vowed to address the rising costs of immigrants claiming benefits. Its General Secretary, Carsten Linnemann, warned against this trend in April. “Once again, it shows how urgently this citizen’s allowance needs to be abolished.” He said the new government, which his party will lead, will “tackle this quickly.” Read more here...
