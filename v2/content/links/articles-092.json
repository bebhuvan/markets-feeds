    "fullContent": "One Of The World's Oldest Asset Classes Just Hit Record Highs Farmland is one of the oldest asset classes, rivaling precious metals in its ability to preserve generational wealth. Unlike stocks or fiat currencies, farmland and cropland are tangible, finite, and highly productive. As the global population continues to grow and demand for healthier food intensifies, arable land per capita is shrinking due to urban sprawl and environmental degradation. This makes farmland not just a low-volatility store of value, but also a necessary hedge against rising global instability and inflationary pressures. The latest USDA Land Values 2025 Report from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reports a 4.3% increase in average farmland values, pushing prices to a record $4,350 per acre. This follows a 5% ($200) increase between 2023 and 2024 and marks the fifth straight year of gains in agricultural real estate. Cash rents for cropland also hit a new high, rising .60% to $161 per acre. Average Farm Real Estate Value – United States: 2011-2025 2025 Farm Real Estate Value by State Average Cropland Value – United States: 2011-2025 2025 Cropland Value by State Average Pasture Value – United States: 2011-2025 2025 Pasture Value by State There's a reason billionaires like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos are quietly buying up vast amounts of farmland: it's low-volatility and an asset that preserves and grows generational wealth.

    "fullContent": "Taibbi Obliterates Dean Of Columbia Journalism School In Open Letter Authored by Matt Taibbi via Racket News, Letter to Bill Grueskin, former Dean of the Columbia Journalism School, on his recent article in the Columbia Journalism Review Mr. Grueskin, Regarding your August 1 article, “Knowing: Still Only Half the Battle,” which lauds Charlie Savage of the New York Times for having “dissected and eviscerated” Director of Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s claims about corruption of intelligence in the Trump-Russia investigation: You praised Savage’s article, “New Reports on Russian Interference Don’t Show What Trump Says They Do,” as an example of the work of an “experienced beat reporter” who can distill complex stories into a “coherent, compelling whole.” Your sub-headline stressed the importance of “showing receipts” in journalism, where “most people don’t follow stories very closely,” but “they can learn a lot when an experienced beat reporter helps them sort out what’s important and what’s chaff.” Chaff. Except — and you should know this because the Columbia Journalism Review published over 20,000 words on the subject in January 2023 — Savage and his colleagues at the Times have badly miscovered this story for nearly a decade, and continue to do so. The 2018 Pulitzer Prize the paper won on the topic along with the Washington Post will go down as the same kind of “disgrace” as its 1932 Pulitzer for Walter Duranty’s breathless coverage of Stalin’s Russia. In this case, the Times drifted so far from its traditional mission that it became an animating motive for Gabbard and other investigators in Donald Trump’s administration. Witness FBI Director Kash Patel throwing down a gauntlet this weekend, right after your piece ran. He challenged media figures who called him a “liar” in 2018, when as an investigator in the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) chaired by California’s Devin Nunes, he outed the Steele Dossier as “fictitious intelligence” used to deceive a federal judge and unlawfully spy on Trump’s campaign. Patel added, “Now I’m the FBI Director,” then hinted that he might release “more docs” so “we can see who is lying,” before ending with a reference to “bogus Pulitzers. Kash Patel calls out the media Is this normal FBI Director behavior? Would Louis Freeh or William Webster call out a newspaper in such a personal way? Probably not. Would most Times readers even know what Patel is talking about? Also probably not, because the paper has consistently responded to criticism by doing what you did in “Knowing: Still Only Half the Battle”: casually dismiss allegations as “false conspiracies” and “chaff,” things educated people may safely ignore, in favor of the wheat in papers like the Times. That attitude only works if the facts are on your side. On this story, they aren’t, and it’s not close. About those “receipts” you praised: As you note, Savage decried “overheated and attention-grabbing claims” made by Trump’s “top officials,” who “accused Mr. Obama of treason and “made criminal referrals” about national security officials under Mr. Obama. Savage may rightly call claims of “treason” overheated, since nothing released yet comes close to meeting the legal definition (though the Times and some of those same “national security officials” similarly overreached when they invoked the word at the beginning of Trump’s first term). There are reports today of the case going to a grand jury, but it’s true we don’t know yet how compelling any criminal evidence might be. Still, Savage added an unsupported line: The administration is trying to distract supporters who are angry about its broken promise to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. It’s a small detail, but characteristic of what the Times has become. An experienced beat reporter would know the administration has been investigating Russiagate since Trump’s inauguration, that Patel referenced a discovery in this investigation on the Joe Rogan Experience on June 6th, and that CIA Director John Ratcliffe kicked off the recent releases with a report on the Trump-Russia probe that came out on July 2, before the much-criticized Epstein announcement by Pam Bondi’s Justice Department on July 7th. There is no fact anywhere to support the idea that recent Russiagate releases are an attempt to “distract supporters who are angry about its broken promise to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.” It’s merely something that sounds right to Times readers, probably because it’s been a talking point hammered by Democratic Party politicians like Arizona’s Mark Kelly (“I think they do not want to talk about Jeffrey Epstein”), Connecticut’s Jim Himes (“A transparent effort to distract from… refusal to release the Jeffrey Epstein files”), even a spokesperson for former President Barack Obama, Patrick Rodenbush (“These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction”). Since when is it good practice for a paper like the Times to present partisan talking points as facts? Savage went on to bristle at Tulsi Gabbard’s recent release of a report prepared by Patel’s team in 2017-2018, about the construction of a January 6, 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) concluding Russia and Vladimir Putin “aspired” to help Donald Trump, for whom he developed a “clear preference.” The HPSCI report dovetailed with Ratcliffe’s report in showing dissent within the team that put together this critical Assessment. While Ratcliffe showed that then-CIA Director John Brennan overrode the written objections of his own Deputy Director of Analysis and the judgments of two of his top Russia experts in using a piece of paid opposition research originating from the Clinton campaign, the Steele dossier, the HPSCI report showed “CIA officer judgments” objecting to the three other key pieces of evidence as containing “substandard information.” The HPSCI report also described how two senior CIA analysts confronted Brennan about the flaws of the Steele dossier, and he replied, “Yes, but doesn’t it ring true?” Your experienced beat writer deigned to describe these and other damning details as “messy,” then dismissed them. One of the key pieces of “evidence” was a “scant, unclear, and unverifiable fragment of a sentence” Brennan himself was told by a supposedly well-placed Russian source eventually “exfiltrated” to Virginia. The fragmentary line, “whose victory Putin was counting on,” turned out to be the only evidence bolstering the notion that Putin specifically wanted to help Donald Trump. Brennan’s own team objected to the fragment’s use because “five people read it five ways,” because the top source was passing on information of unknown origin, and because Brennan’s methods of conveying the intelligence were suspect. The report was not “formally disseminated” or put in writing; Brennan briefed the group and President Obama orally. The HPSCI investigators summarized complaints of the ICA’s authors: By briefing the information orally, however, DCIA could have tailored his message to different officials, unconstrained by a consistent record copу. Savage conveyed many of the details just related: that the intelligence faced objections from report authors, that the report failed to notice this key piece of evidence was “disputed,” that analysts didn’t know what the line meant or “who specifically the mole had heard that from,” and that Ratcliffe concluded the report incorrectly described the key judgment that Putin “aspired” to help Trump warranted “high confidence,” a designation that requires multiple sources, when “only one source explicitly and directly backed that finding.” So yes, Savage agreed, the sole piece of evidence on which the judgment that Putin “aspired” to help Trump was thirdhand, rejected intelligence of disputed meaning that was also incorrectly labeled as warranting “high confidence.” There is a but passage coming, but it’s worth pausing to note what Savage conceded about the evidentiary basis for countless New York Times stories, including an A1 bombshell put together online on December 9th, 2016, hours after Barack Obama ordered the writing of the new Assessment. In the next day’s print edition, it was headlined: “Russian Hackers Acted to Aid Trump, U.S. Says.” The lede from that piece: WASHINGTON — American intelligence agencies have concluded with “high confidence” that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton’s chances and promote Donald J. Trump, according to senior administration officials. The Times trumpeted “high confidence” for years, only calling attention to the dissent by the NSA and other CIA analysts when Brennan himself wrote about it in his book, Undaunted, in October of 2020. (The CIA Director had time to write a book before the Times zeroed in on this key detail!) That years-too-late story was called, “Brennan Rebuffed Requests to Lower Confidence in Key Russia Finding.” As for the use of the Steele dossier in the ICA, the salient fact for any editor attempting objectivity would be that this crude intelligence forgery — later demolished as “rumor,” “speculation,” and “hearsay” in a report by Obama-appointed Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who noted the FBI found “zero” corroboration for its claims — was employed at all in such an impactful report. Not according to Savage, who appeared laser-focused on setting up a legal defense against perjury charges for Brennan, writing about how the newly disclosed material “complicates” Brennan’s Congressional testimony: Mr. Brennan has publicly said the Steele dossier material was not incorporated or used in the assessment itself because of the C.I.A.’s concerns. In 2017, he told Congress that the dossier “was not in any way used as a basis for the intelligence community assessment that was done.” The newly disclosed material complicates that narrative. For one, it showed that Mr. Brennan internally defended appending a summary of the dossier to the assessment after C.I.A. analysts resisted the compromise, too… For another, the material has revealed that the classified version of the assessment alerted readers to the existence of the annex. It did so in a fourth bullet point under the judgment that Mr. Putin aspired to help Mr. Trump’s chances of winning. “For additional reporting on Russian plans and intentions, please see Annex A: Additional Reporting from an F.B.I. Source on Russian Influence Efforts,” the bullet point said… Mr. Trump’s allies have argued that this sentence means the information from the Steele dossier was incorporated into the assessment itself. The great New York Times is reduced to arguing an absurd semantic point, that material included in an “annex” to a report can properly be described as having not been used “in any way” as a “basis” for that same report. Savage’s other effort in this article is to defend against charges that the CIA used discarded, unclear, unverifiable evidence to secure a “high confidence” judgment by conceding all of the above, but noting that the NSA properly ascribed to the claim “moderate confidence,” which in the intelligence world means something between “not really” and “definitely maybe.” That is what you described as Savage having “dissected and eviscerated” allegations that Obama and his deputies ginned up “false conspiracies” around the 2016 election. As a reminder, these “false conspiracies” are the same stories a hyperventilating Times rode all the way to a Pulitzer Prize. How shameful was that Pulitzer? Take one of the winning entries: “Unlikely Source Propelled Russian Meddling Inquiry,” from December 30, 2017. That bombshell report by Sharon LaFraniere, Mark Mazzetti and Matt Apuzzo, about the ostensible origin story of the Trump-Russia investigation, opened in dramatic fashion: During a night of heavy drinking at an upscale London bar in May 2016, George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, made a startling revelation to Australia’s top diplomat in Britain: Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton. About three weeks earlier, Mr. Papadopoulos had been told that Moscow had thousands of emails that would embarrass Mrs. Clinton, apparently stolen in an effort to try to damage her campaign. Obviously, you’re a former Journalism School Dean and I’m not, but I wouldn’t have thought you could win a Pulitzer Prize writing a lede with no attributions in which all the new facts are wrong. The assertion that the young Trump aide Papadopoulos spoke of “dirt” or “thousands of emails” was eventually blown up by Alexander Downer, the Australian diplomat mentioned. From the report by Special Counsel John Durham, who noted that Downer said in interviews there was “no mention” of these headline details, and that Papadopoulos simply said “the Russians have information”: No one deconstructed this story more thoroughly than Jeff Gerth in the same Columbia Journalism Review. Gerth noted that the Times omitted to include public denials by the ostensible source of the “dirt,” a mysterious Maltese professor named Josef Mifsud. Gerth also noted that the lead investigator of “Crossfire Hurricane,” Peter Strzok, told him “There never was a case opened on the Trump campaign—it was opened to identify whoever might have received the Russian offer.” The Russian offer in question was actually a Maltese offer, which the Maltese person denied offering (Mifsud told the FBI he “did not make any offers or proffer any information to Papadopoulos”), and which Downer denied hearing. Incidentally, Savage in 2023 would link to this prizewinning story, which he described as being about “an Australian diplomat’s tip that a Trump campaign adviser had seemed to disclose advance knowledge that Russia would release hacked Democratic emails.” By then there was no one left still claiming to have said or heard anything about “advance knowledge” of releasing hacked emails. As noted in this space a few days ago, the Times in the piece you praised rewrote a passage about the Downer story without mentioning the name “Papadopoulos,” or “dirt,” or “emails,” or “advance knowledge,” saying only that the Trump campaign “had received outreach from Russia and knew what it would do.” All the juicy headline details from this and other big Times Trump-Russia stories have been wiped away by time. Take the worst story the Times wrote about this topic, “Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence.” It wasn’t a Pulitzer entry, but it was “almost entirely wrong,” as Comey agreed in testimony that year. The Times was nonetheless so excited about its non-scoop that, as Gerth recounted, it hired a Showtime crew to film them faceplanting the editorial process for a documentary called The Fourth Estate. “Are we sure we’re not feeding a conspiracy,” reporter Mark Mazzetti asked, with “recurring themes of contacts?” No, and it was “the biggest story in years,” triumphant editor Dean Baquet chirped. It was the biggest story in years, but because it was wrong and embarrassing, not the other reason. Still, your Columbia Journalism Review found the scene dazzling: The film shows that the “daily miracle” of the Times is an enormous undertaking. The “daily miracle.” That’s not at all a fatuous, self-congratulating or grandiose sentiment! Thank goodness it’s others who serve up “chaff” and “false conspiracies.” With respect, isn’t it time someone at the Times stepped outside the bubble, and took a hard look back?

    "fullContent": "Sensex, Nifty, Share Prices LIVE: Indian markets are expected to open flat to negative due to concerns over tariffs, with the Gift Nifty indicating a potential slip of about 50 points. Market sentiment is affected by uncertainty following recent statements from the US President and a lack of significant positive surprises from Q1 FY25 earnings. Analysts suggest that all attention is now on the upcoming RBI MPC meeting, where the tone of commentary will be crucial amid global uncertainties. While volatility has slightly decreased, key resistance levels are identified at 24,800 and 25,000, with support at 24,600. Traders are advised to adopt a cautious yet optimistic approach, focusing on quality stocks and managing risks effectively. Heavy selling by foreign portfolio investors adds to the negative bias, particularly impacting oil and gas sectors.",

    "fullContent": "Trump Accumulates Wins On Supreme Court's Emergency Docket - Key Takeaways Authored by Sam Dorman via The Epoch Times, President Donald Trump’s ambitious agenda has been met with order after order from lower courts temporarily blocking him. Many of those have been lifted by the Supreme Court, handing Trump several wins and raising questions about how lower courts have been handling his cases. These decisions have mostly come on what’s known as the “emergency” or “shadow docket,” a set of more urgent appeals that the Supreme Court often decides without oral argument. The Supreme Court sometimes issues a ruling without explanation in these cases. The resulting decisions—at least 21 in Trump’s second administration—have prompted varying alliances and opinions that reflect apparent frustration among the justices. Here are some takeaways from Trump’s battles at the Supreme Court during the 2024-2025 term. Trump’s Winning Streak The administration has been remarkably successful at the high court, obtaining relief in 14 of the 18 appeals that have been ruled on by the justices. So far, the Supreme Court has allowed Trump to block spending across multiple departments, remove high-ranking bureaucrats and probationary employees, and move forward with immigration enforcement measures. Perhaps his biggest victory came in June when the justices ruled against the use of nationwide injunctions. Such orders have blocked many of Trump’s policies on a nationwide basis, rather than just for the parties before the court. But Trump’s victories so far have been relatively limited, usually scoring temporary relief from lower court orders while the justices refrained from making final decisions on the legality of Trump’s policies. “The merits of most challenges to Administration policies did not reach the Court so we have no clear sense of how much of the President’s agenda it will sustain,” Georgetown University Law Professor David Super told The Epoch Times. In at least a handful of cases, the justices ruled against Trump. For example, they said in May that Trump had provided inadequate due process for individuals subject to deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. A majority of the justices temporarily halted deportations on two occasions while leaving unresolved meatier questions about whether Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act was valid. That decision—and another effectively forcing the disbursement of foreign aid—drew some heavy criticism from Justice Samuel Alito. “Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?” he asked in an opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch in March. “The answer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No,’ but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise,” he added, noting that he was “stunned.” Lower Courts’ Authority Alito’s comment was one of many questioning the authority of lower courts in blocking the president’s policies. Much of the administration’s arguments in court have focused on whether federal district judges have authority to even hear particular cases or second-guess the administration’s judgments. Trump’s mass firings, for example, have brought into focus how much Congress can limit his ability to fire employees. That’s particularly true for high-ranking bureaucrats, whose positions Congress may have attempted to insulate by saying they cannot be fired without cause. A long list of officials have already sued, providing cases for the Supreme Court to weigh in on a nearly century-old precedent on the president’s removal power. While the Supreme Court initially refused Trump’s request to fire a watchdog within the government, it temporarily allowed other removals of labor board officials and those on a consumer safety commission. While the ruling on nationwide injunctions limited courts’ authority, many other questions remain unanswered—including how litigants might obtain nationwide relief through other legal tools. Besides that question, the Supreme Court could grapple more deeply with whether disputes with federal employees must go through an administrative process before reaching federal courts. Another question is whether challenges to Trump’s funding cuts should be brought in those courts rather than in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. A law known as the Tucker Act grants the Court of Claims jurisdiction over contract disputes, but some federal judges have said the administration is misapplying this law. In April, a majority of the Supreme Court seemed to side with the Trump administration when it removed a lower court’s block on Trump’s attempt to freeze millions in Education Department grants. While they didn’t offer a final opinion on lower courts’ jurisdiction, an unsigned majority opinion seemed to favor the president’s view. “The Government is likely to succeed in showing the District Court lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money,” the “per curiam,” or unsigned opinion, read. Moving Too Quickly? Not everyone was on board with that opinion. Besides Chief Justice John Roberts, the three liberal justices—Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson—said they would have ruled differently. In that case and others, the dissents featured similar concerns from both conservative and liberal justices. Kagan worried that the court was moving too quickly on the education grants and failed to thoroughly consider the issue. “The risk of error increases when this Court decides cases—as here—with barebones briefing, no argument, and scarce time for reflection,” she said, before suggesting the court created “new law” on the emergency docket. Sotomayor later quoted that portion of Kagan’s opinion when she dissented from the court’s decision to remove blocks on Trump’s Alien Enemies Act deportations in April. The administration’s deportations under the 18th-century law have sparked four decisions from the court this past term. In one decision, justices said the administration had to facilitate the return of one of the men deported to El Salvador. In a separate case, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked Trump’s deportations for a group of detainees in Texas before that group or class had been certified in a lower court. In class action lawsuits, a court has to certify the class of plaintiffs before the action can proceed. A dissent written by Alito and Thomas had strong words for this aspect of the decision and others. “In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,” the dissent, authored by Alito, read. The opinions in these cases have been brief, often leaving questions about how lower courts should view particular legal issues. At an event for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Kagan said in July that the court “should be cautious” about acting on the emergency docket and cited issues like a lack of briefing. “The orders themselves don’t tell anybody anything about why we’ve done what we’ve done,” she said. “I think there are some things you can pretty well guess, but there are lots of other things … where you can’t,” she said. According to media outlets, Kavanaugh defended shorter orders at an event in Missouri on July 31. “There can be a risk, in writing the opinion, of a lock-in effect, of making a snap judgment and putting it in writing, in a written opinion that’s not going to reflect the final view,” he said.

    "fullContent": "Brazil's Lula Defiant: 'I Will Not Call Trump, Am Not Afraid' President Trump has sent a message to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva saying the Brazilian leader could \"call him anytime\" to discuss the trade dispute centered on the country's treatment of ex-leader Jair Bolsonaro. Lula has defiantly responded Tuesday with the statement, \"I will not call Trump because he does not want to talk.\" He further asserted that nobody gives him lessons in negotiations. Speaking during an event held in Brasilia, he made clear: \"I don’t want people to think I am afraid of Donald Trump\" and that \"the US president had no right to announced the tariffs on Brazil the way he did\" - especially as they make no sense. Via AFP Additional vehement complaints about the US position, at a moment a record-setting 50% tariff has taken effect for many Brazilian goods entering the US, are as follows via Bloomberg: US attacks on instant payment system Pix are unjustified, we cannot be penalized for developing a free and efficient system, said Lula The allegations about the Pix payment system, regulation of digital platforms and deforestation are unreasonable “Pix is a national heritage and an international reference for public and digital infrastructure. I would like President Trump to try out Pix in the US.” Brazil never left the negotiation table Political and electoral interests cannot contaminate commercial relations Critical minerals belong to Brazil and will not be explored by other nations The Trump administration is demanding that charges against Bolsonaro, stemming from his rejection of the election results which brought Lula back to power, be dropped. However, the government has emphasized the independence of the judiciary. A week ago the US slapped sanctions on Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. But regional analyst Bruna Santos of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington DC, has explained that dropping the charges against Bolsonaro is simply not going to happen. \"The ask for Lula was undoable,\" he was quoted in the Associated Press as saying. \"In the long run, you are leaving a scar on the relationship between the two largest democracies in the hemisphere.\" ‘I’m NOT going to call Trump to negotiate’ – Lula Brazilian Prez. says Trump has no interest in talking He also reveals what he’ll be saying to Putin, Xi, and Modi pic.twitter.com/GCUlnsvviA — RT (@RT_com) August 5, 2025 As of Monday Bolsonaro has been ordered under house arrest, with the federal top court citing violations related to stoking resentment via social media and public messaging. For now at least, it looks like the government is backing down, despite the damage to trade relations and future economic pain. Tyler Durden Tue, 08/05/2025 - 20:30",
