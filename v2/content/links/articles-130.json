None of the weaknesses addressed this month are known to be actively exploited, but 14 of the flaws earned Microsoft’s most-dire “critical” rating, meaning they could be exploited to seize control over vulnerable Windows PCs with little or no help from users. While not listed as critical, CVE-2025-49719 is a publicly disclosed information disclosure vulnerability, with all versions as far back as SQL Server 2016 receiving patches. Microsoft rates CVE-2025-49719 as less likely to be exploited, but the availability of proof-of-concept code for this flaw means its patch should probably be a priority for affected enterprises. Mike Walters, co-founder of Action1, said CVE-2025-49719 can be exploited without authentication, and that many third-party applications depend on SQL server and the affected drivers — potentially introducing a supply-chain risk that e",

Our emphasis on high-quality financials with healthy asset quality and consistent growth continues to reflect in steady performance. While overall loan growth in the sector has moderated, KCP lenders remain ahead of the broader banking space and have maintained resilient asset quality. Our bottom-up investment approach has led to selective additions across home finance, microfinance, and fintech, keeping valuation discipline in focus. #KingsOfCapital #Marcellus #Finance",
