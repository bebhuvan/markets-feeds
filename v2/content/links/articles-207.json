Although I love a good pool, its other incredible amenities actually won me overKristine HansenI love booking hotels with pools, so I was excited to stay at The Royal Sonesta Kaua'i resort.This resort has one of the biggest pools in Hawaii, and it really looked incredible.However, I barely went in it because I enjoyed the property and its proximity to the beach so much.Most travelers have an amenity that either makes or breaks a hotel reservation. For me, it's the pool.Each year, I spend about 60 nights in hotel rooms — but I'll only book a stay after I've scanned a property's website and socials to confirm it has a pool that looks like the epitome of relaxation.Honestly, I care about having a pool more than I do a great view from my room or a rainfall shower. I love swimming, and I'm even happir when I can enjoy comfy lounge chairs and poolside service between dips.Such lounging is exactly what ",

    "fullContent": "Apple Inc. reported third-quarter revenue that handily topped analysts’ estimates, boosted by surprisingly strong sales of the iPhone and products in China. Revenue rose 9.6% to $94 billion in the period, which ended June 28, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts estimated $89.3 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple had projected a $900 million headwind from tariffs during the period, saying that revenue would grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Though US tariffs are still expected to weigh on results in the long run, they likely provided a boon to Apple in the latest period — with consumers rushing to stores to get out ahead of expected price increases. The company also has been staging a comeback in China, a market where local phone brands have made inroads with consumers. Bloomberg's Sarah Frier and Tigress Financial Partners CIO Ivan Feinseth join Bloomberg Businesswek Daily to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)",
