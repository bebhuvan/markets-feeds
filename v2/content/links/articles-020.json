From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&P 500 are up 28 and DOW futures are up 168 (fair value). Oil prices were down over the last week with WTI futures at $65.16 per barrel and Brent at $68.44 per barrel. A year ago, WTI was at $79, and Brent was at $81 - so WTI oil prices are down about 20% year-over-year. Here is a graph from Gasbuddy.com for nationwide gasoline prices.

The designation, issued by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on July 25 under counterterrorism authorities, blocks all property and interests of the group within U.S. jurisdiction, and generally prohibits Americans from engaging in transactions with it. “Today’s action further exposes the illegitimate Maduro regime’s facilitation of narco-terrorism through terrorist groups like Cartel de los Soles,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. “The Treasury Department will continue to execute on President [Donald] Trump’s pledge to",

This involves not selecting the features or predictors to be included in the model, but rather the statistical techniques that will generate the best predictions. Not all modeling approaches are the same, so knowing when to use the best techniques is an important skill. The paper \"From OLS to neural nets: Comparing regression models in systematic trading\" is not the final word on this question. Still, it does a good job of making comparisons across techniques. It does not address all the machine learning techniques, yet it does compare many of the simple techniques that most researchers may employ. The tables from the paper are nice to have handy for anyone starting out when thinking about modeling.",

In 2018, the firm changed the information displayed on its internal platform, so that financial advisors could no longer observe which clients’ holdings were in paper gain or loss. Using data on portfolio stock transactions between 2016 and 2021, we show that, while all investors exhibit a significant disposition effect before 2018, i.e., a greater propensity to realize gains than losses, highly-advised investors see their bias significantly reduced afterward. Our paper shows that by appropriately manipulating advisors’ information, financial firms can successfully reduce their clients’ biases.",

    "summary": "Governments have a long history of regulating entrepreneurs’ use of limited liability by mandating a minimum amount of paid-in equity. While opponents argue that these requirements pose an unnecessary barrier to entrepreneurship, proponents maintain that they protect stakeholders, in part by screening out low-quality entrepreneurship. We exploit a 2012 Norwegian reform that lowered the capital requirement from $17,000 to $5,000 to study this quantity-quality trade-off.

    "summary": "Judge Maintains Nationwide Block On Trump's Birthright Citizenship Order Authored by Sam Dorman via The Epoch Times, A federal judge in Massachusetts has maintained his nationwide block on President Donald Trump’s policy restricting birthright citizenship, saying that a narrower injunction would be impractical and create too many problems for states that sued the administration. “The record does not support a finding that any narrower option would feasibly and adequately protect the plaintiffs from the injuries they have shown they are likely to suffer if the unlawful policy announced in [Trump’s] Executive Order takes effect during the pendency of this lawsuit,” U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin said in an opinion on July 25. Sorokin’s opinion came nearly a month after the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v.

    "summary": "Bezos Dumps $5.7 Billion In Amazon Stock. Now CNBC Buyout Rumors Swirl Jeff Bezos has generated billions of dollars in Amazon stock sales since late June under a 10b5-1 plan. The divestitures coincide with a new report suggesting he's mulling over a potential acquisition of CNBC. According to Bloomberg data, Bezos has been on a selling spree since late June, capitalizing on Amazon's stock rebound from its April lows. So far, the sales have generated $5.7 billion for the billionaire. Here's more from the Bloomberg report: The sales, which began when Bezos unloaded $737 million around his weekend nuptials in Venice, were part of a trading plan for up to 25 million shares that he adopted earlier this year. He sold the last of the 25 million on Wednesday and Thursday, divesting about 4.2 million shares for $954 million, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Friday. Amid Bezos' dumping of stock under the 10b5-1 plan, a new report emerged last week from The New York Pos",
