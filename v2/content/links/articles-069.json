Drawing on leadership experience at CalPERS, British Telecom Pension Scheme, and Nuveen, Anson reflects on regulatory complexity, the evolution of global equity markets, and why a 30/30/40 allocation model remains relevant. The episode explores emerging market opportunities, accessing the illiquidity premium in private capital, and how rising uncertainty—from geopolitical shifts to potential changes in endowment taxation—is shaping portfolio strategy. Anson also shares thoughtful advice for early-career professionals on developing global perspective and getting the most out of the CFA® charter. Tune in for a timely conversation on building resilient portfolios in an increasingly interconnected—and unpredictable—world.",
