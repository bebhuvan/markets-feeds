From Goldman Sachs: We forecast a 100k increase in payrolls in July. Big data indicators point to a rebound in private sector job growth, though to a still soft pace. ... We expect the unemployment rate to rebound to 4.2% based on the signal from other measures of labor market slack such as continuing jobless claims.emphasis addedFrom BofA: July NFP are likely to rise by 60k.
