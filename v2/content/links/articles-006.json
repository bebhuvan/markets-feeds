Roads in several areas got inundated after the heavy downpour. Some low-lying areas like the Andheri Subway and Lokhandwala Complex witnessed water accumulation at a few locations, affecting traffic movement. Local trains, considered as the lifeline of the metropolis, were running late by 8 to 10 minutes and there was no suspension of services, according to officials. In its latest bulletin, the IMD has upgraded and issued a ‘red’ alert for Mumbai, Thane and Raigad districts for the next two days. Data from the IMD shows that in the 24 hours ending 8.30 am on Monday, the suburban Santacruz station received 99 mm rainfall while the Colaba coastal observatory registered 38 mm of rainfall. As heavy rains lashed Mumbai on Monday, waterlogging was reported in several pockets, leading to slow moving traffic. Airlines such as Akasa Air and IndiGo issued advisories for travellers, asking them to keep additional time in hand as some routes leading to the Mumbai airport witnessed traffic congestion.",
