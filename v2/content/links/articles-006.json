    "fullContent": "US, Gulf Tie Lebanon Reconstruction Funds To Total Hezbollah Disarmament Via The Cradle Lebanon is under pressure from the US and Gulf nations to completely disarm Hezbollah in exchange for loans and investments needed to rebuild the country following a devastating war with Israel last year, Bloomberg reported Saturday. US President Donald Trump has presented Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam with recommendations for dismantling the group, according to Tom Barrack, the US envoy to the country. Barrack said the US has told Aoun it is willing to serve as an intermediary if he moves to disband Hezbollah. Source: AFP At the same time, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait have told President Aoun and Prime Minister Salam that “funds for reconstruction and investment in Lebanon are contingent upon a timetable-bound plan to fully disarm Hezbollah,” Bloomberg wrote, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter. US envoy Barrack also emphasized that disarming and dismantling Hezbollah, the Shia resistance movement that has defended the country from Israel for decades, is the key to unlocking Gulf funding. “Gulf countries have said, ‘if you do these things, we will come to the south of Lebanon, and we will fund an industrial zone, renovation, and jobs,’” he said. Much of southern Lebanon was destroyed by relentless Israeli bombing during the two-month war last fall. Prime Minister Salam has asked the Lebanese military to present a plan by the end of August to dismantle all non-state armed groups by the end of the year. Hezbollah issued a statement on Wednesday saying it would not respect the government’s demand that it disarm. The group accused Salam of committing a “grave sin” by pursuing a “surrender strategy” amid “ongoing Israeli aggression and occupation.” Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem said Tuesday that Hezbollah “won’t engage on disarmament just because the US or a certain Arab country is seeking and applying all the pressure it can muster.” During a cabinet session earlier this week, Lebanese Minister of Labor Mohammad Haidar spoke against US envoy Barrack’s proposal to disarm Hezbollah. “I am one of the people – how can I face the mother of a martyr or a young man living in existential anxiety and tell him he must give up the only guarantee that protects him?” Haidar stated. He emphasized that any discussion of Hezbollah giving up its weapons is premature without Israel’s withdrawal, the return of prisoners, an end to attacks, and a serious reconstruction process. ⚡️ Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem: \"We don't accept to be slaves to anyone, neither to America nor to some Arab countries nor to anyone in the world... Either Lebanon, all of Lebanon, will come out victorious, or all of Lebanon will lose.\" pic.twitter.com/vn9R8gf4SO — COMBATE |🇵🇷 (@upholdreality) August 5, 2025 Despite the ceasefire reached between Israel and Hezbollah in November last year, Israel continues to occupy five positions inside Lebanon and regularly bombs Lebanese territory, killing dozens. On Thursday, an Israeli strike targeted a vehicle in eastern Lebanon near the Masnaa border crossing with Syria, killing five people. Among the dead was Mohammed Wishah, a member of the central committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and his bodyguard. Another drone strike the same day killed a Lebanese civilian in the town of Kfar Dan, west of Baalbek. The Israeli air force bombed 10 sites in south Lebanon the day before, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA). Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 03:30",

    "fullContent": "UK Homelessness Minister Quits After Making Her Own Tenants Homeless Authored by Thomas Brooke via Remix News, Rushanara Ali has resigned from her role as Minister for Homelessness in Keir Starmer’s left-wing government following reports that she removed tenants from her east London townhouse and relisted the property with a £700-per-month rent increase. The revelations, first reported by the i Paper, raised concerns about a perceived conflict between Ali’s personal actions as a landlord and her public stance on housing policy. Bangladeshi-born Ali, who represents Bethnal Green and Stepney, submitted her resignation to Prime Minister Keir Starmer in a letter late on Thursday. She wrote, “It is with a heavy heart that I offer you my resignation as a Minister,” and emphasized that she had always followed legal requirements, stating, “I believe I took my responsibilities and duties seriously, and the facts demonstrate this.” It has been an honour to have served in this Labour Government. To avoid any further distraction for the government, I have resigned as a Minister. My letter to the Prime Minister.https://t.co/fOes7m3cUH pic.twitter.com/TNJIXxzhWU — Rushanara Ali MP 💙 (@rushanaraali) August 7, 2025 The MP said she was stepping down because her continued presence in the role would be “a distraction from the ambitious work of the government.” She cited supposed achievements made during her tenure, including tackling rough sleeping, strengthening democracy, and developing a pathway to end the war in Gaza. It is unclear why a homelessness minister elected by Brits in the United Kingdom considered the war in Gaza to be on her list of priorities. Ali has previously spoken out against landlords who exploit private renters and supported Labour’s upcoming Renters’ Rights Bill, which will bar landlords from relisting properties at higher rents within six months of ending a tenancy to sell. A source close to Ali claimed the tenants were told their lease would not be renewed and were offered the option of staying on a rolling contract. The source said the house was initially put up for sale, and only relisted for rent after a buyer was not found. In response to her resignation, Prime Minister Keir Starmer thanked Ali for her work in government. “Your diligent work at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, including your efforts to put in measures to repeal the Vagrancy Act, will have a significant impact,” he wrote. “I know you will continue to support the Government from the backbenches and represent the best interests of your constituents in Bethnal Green and Stepney.” Read more here...
