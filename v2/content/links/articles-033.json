    "fullContent": "Trump Tempers Expectations Ahead Of Alaska \"Feel-Out Meeting\" With Putin During President Donald Trump's wide-raning news conference held at the White House on Monday, he was asked about the much anticipated Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which is of course stirring much controversy given European fears that he'll do a deal which sidelines Ukraine's interests. \"This is a war that should never have happened,\" Trump began in this section of the presser. \"This is a war that wouldn't have happened if I were president, it would never have happened.\" These statements are nothing new, but what followed is a first. Trump then interestingly for the first time used language about the Friday planned summit which appears aimed at greatly tempering expectations. This is after several rounds of US-backed Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul failed to produce any breakthroughs. Trump described the talks with Putin as merely a \"feel-out meeting\" and said that Putin \"wants to get involved\". He then voiced his belief that Putin wants to get the war \"over with\". Via Shutterstock \"I've said that a few times and I've been disappointed because I'd have a great call with him and then missiles would be lobbed into Kyiv or some other place,\" Trump stated. He futher pledged that he'll tell Putin \"you've got to end this war, you've got to end it\". And he sought to once again reassure European leaders -\"who I get along with very well\" - saying they will be the first phone call after the talks are over. As for whether a final deal could be achieved in Alaska, Trump emphasized that \"it's not up to me\". Again choosing language which seeks to manage expectations, Trump casually said: \"I got a call to say they'd like to meet, and I'm going to see what they want to meet about.\" \"I'd like to see a ceasefire, I'd like to see the best deal that could be made for both parties, it takes two to tango,\" he added, which could be interpreted as a jab toward Ukraine. Trump at one point in his comments mistakenly said: \"We're going to Russia. That's going to be a big deal.\" He perhaps has a future trip to Russia in mind, as a return gesture for Putin coming to American soil to talk. But then near the end of the remarks he offered a corrective, saying \"I thought it was very respectful that the president of Russia is coming to our country, as opposed to us going to his country, or even a third, third party place.\" Such warm words said of Putin will likely make Zelensky nervous, hearkening back to the opening months of Trump taking office, when Trump's relations with Zelensky hit a low-point, and criticisms aimed at Kiev came weekly. Some analysts have already pointed out that these Monday statements from Trump don't bode well for Ukraine and a favorable settlement on its terms. 'This is a feel-out meeting' — Trump on Alaska sit-down with Putin Claims Putin 'wants to get it over with', but laments missiles flying into Kiev after 'great calls' Says 5–7k dying weekly, Ukraine now drafting 60-year-olds https://t.co/iZLnNvgjtl pic.twitter.com/cFBJcRXLPq — RT (@RT_com) August 11, 2025 Meanwhile, Zelensky in fresh statements has highlighted Russia has only stepped-up aerial attacks on Ukraine of late. He talled that in just the past week, Russia sent more than 1,000 air bombs, nearly 1,400 drones and several missile strikes on Ukraine. But Ukraine has also been hitting Russian oil refineries on a weekly basis at this point, as both sides continue to target energy infrastructure. Ukraine's position has been to accuse Russia of simply trying to buy time, and that it's not actually interested in negotiating peace. The fact that Trump is even meeting with Putin is being felt as a huge slap in the face in Kiev. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 14:25",

    "fullContent": "86% Of Americans Feel Stressed About The Cost Of Groceries Authored by Michael Snyder via TheMostImportantNews.com, Why are social media platforms filled with videos of Americans complaining about grocery prices right now? Needless to say, those videos must be striking a chord, because some of them are receiving millions of views. Government bureaucrats are telling us that the cost of food is only going up a few percentage points per year, but we can all see that is a load of nonsense. A trip to the grocery store has become an enormous expense, and this is especially true if you have kids to feed. As I wrote about earlier this month, one survey found that in 25 percent of U.S. households at least one person is skipping meals so that there will be enough money to pay the bills. Sadly, we are being warned that the cost of groceries will go even higher in the months ahead. Several years ago, I kept warning my readers over and over again that soon the cost of groceries would become very painful. Without a doubt, that time has arrived. According to a recent AP poll, the cost of groceries is a “source of stress” for 86 percent of U.S. adults… Does your run to the supermarket cause a spike in your blood pressure? You’re in good company. The overwhelming majority of Americans – 86% – say the cost of groceries is at least a minor source of stress. The number includes 53% who say it’s a major source of anxiety in their lives right now. That’s according to a new Associated Press/NORC poll. Those are very alarming numbers. But this is the world that we live in now. And this is why we are seeing so many videos on social media about grocery prices. Someone put together a compilation of some of the best videos where people are really flipping out emotionally… In my entire lifetime, I have never seen it so bad. At one grocery store in Chicago, one woman admitted that it feels like “you’re spending your soul on groceries”… At a South Loop grocery store, customers experience sticker shock and frustration. “No matter if it’s organic or if it’s regular, it’s still going to be an arm and a leg for it. It’s like you’re spending your soul on groceries,” said shopper Tria Hutson. This is one of the reasons why I get so frustrated with the talking heads on television that are telling us that everything is fine. Just look around you. People are hurting. Some companies are trying to hide their price hikes by keeping the prices the same but putting less stuff in each package. This is known as “shinkflation”, and Jim Quinn recently shared a personal anecdote from his own life… I think a personal anecdote I’ve experienced will show you the devious methods corporations will use to pass these tariffs along. I have been buying a pack of coated paper plates at Wal-Mart for years. The pack contained 70 paper plates. Within the last four months, the pack was reduced to 50 plates, for the same price. They know the average dolt, after years of government schooling, is deficient in math skills, so they would not realize they just experienced a 40% increase in price per plate. This will show up nowhere in the fake BLS numbers. Shrinkflation is just as bad as inflation, but they can hide it and pretend all is well, while maintaining their profits. I am sure that you are running into the same thing. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning. How can I be so confident in saying that? Let me give you just one example. Approximately two-thirds of U.S. adults drink coffee, and approximately one-third of all the coffee we drink comes from Brazil. Thanks to the 50 percent tariff that was just placed on imports from Brazil, coffee is about to become a lot more expensive… The U.S. relies heavily on Brazil to import coffee for the 165 million people who need their daily caffeine fix, but Trump’s 50 percent tariff threatens the long-term availability and price of the drink. “When people go to their local coffee shop, whether it’s Starbucks or something else, by and large they will likely be buying some form of Brazilian coffee,” Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told NPR. “A 50 percent tariff will kill that market.” I still remember the days when you could get a cup of coffee for 10 cents. What did your latest cup of coffee cost you? Of course everything else is becoming more expensive too, and our cost of living crisis never seems to end. As a result, 62 percent of Gen Z Americans have no emergency savings at all… 62% of Gen Z have no emergency savings, nearly double the rate of baby boomers. 51% of Americans would use a credit card for a $500 emergency, with usage jumping to 70% among students. Two-thirds of consumers have six months or less in savings, with Gen X the least prepared. 76% lack a credit card set aside for emergencies, relying instead on everyday-use cards. Most of the country is living on the edge financially. The middle class is steadily shrinking, and those that remain in the middle class have much less discretionary income than they once did. So restaurants all over the nation find themselves torn between rapidly rising costs and customers that now have a lot less money to spend… Ike’s Chili in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has been around for 117 years, surviving a myriad of challenges like the Great Depression, the Covid-19 pandemic and a once-in-a-generation burst of inflation. But 2025 already holds an even more complicated challenge. “The cost of everything’s just going up, and we’ve got to figure out how to manage it right,” Len Wade, a managing partner at the restaurant, told CNN. He pointed to surging beef prices as an example, specifically hamburger meat on the wholesale level. In July, those prices were up nearly 21% compared to the same month 10 years ago, federal data shows. And passing the buck to customers might not be the best solution, Wade said. Tourist destinations from coast to coast are experiencing the same thing. Las Vegas is getting far less tourist traffic than it once did, and those that do arrive are tipping a lot less… Las Vegas servers say they’re feeling the heat as high prices and declining tourism hammer their tip earnings across the Strip. Tipping in Sin City is reportedly down by as much as 50% among servers, as some of them blame the economy and policy while others point to high prices, a tipping backlash and poor service. On Reddit’s r/VegasLocals forum, one cocktail waitress wrote, “I used to average about 80 cents a drink. Now I’m averaging about 10 cents.” Nobody can deny what is happening. We really are experiencing a very serious economic crisis. Sticking our heads in the sand and pretending that everything is okay is not going to fix anything. Our standard of living really is collapsing, and a lot more pain is ahead as our economic bubbles continue to burst. We were warned that this storm was coming for a long time, and now it is here.
