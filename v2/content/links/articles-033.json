(NYSE:ICE) ... today released its June 2025 ICE First Look, which shows that while overall mortgage payment performance remains strong, delinquencies rose on a monthly basis while foreclosures trended notably higher year over year (YoY).

FHA delinquencies, which tend to experience more seasonality, rose by 41 bps in the month, hitting their highest June level since 2013, excluding the 2020-2021 pandemic-era impact. • Serious delinquencies (SDQs) – loans 90+ days past due but not in foreclosure – held",

Sales of new single-family houses in June 2025 were at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 627,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The first graph shows New Home Sales vs. recessions since 1963. The dashed line is the current sales rate. New home sales were below pre-pandemic levels. The second graph shows New Home Months of Supply. The months of supply increased in June to 9.8 months from 9.7 months in May. The all-time record high was 12.2 months of supply in January 2009. The all-time record low was 3.3 months in August 2020. This is well above the top of the normal",

    "summary": "The determination of the macroeconomic drivers of stocks and bands is a topic that has received much attention. If you can crack the holy grail of what drivers the major asset classes, you will be in a great position to manage any diversified stock bond portfolio. We know that the corrrelaiton between these two assets follows wide regime changes from positive to negative and then back again, so it is critical to find the key relationships. The recent CFA Institute brief, \"Macroeconomic Drivers of Stocks and Bonds,\" utilizes an extensive dataset of macroeconomic variables to identify the key drivers. The focus of the paper is on factor selection using LASSO regression, which facilitates the stability selection of variables, and out-of-sample random forest regressions to enhance the prediction of key variables. The brief finds that LASSO regression can help narrow the set of factors used in finding these key relationships, and the use of random forests can lead to a significant reduction",

The four week average declined -5,000 to 214,500, also the lowest such number since mid-April. Contrarily, with the typical one week delay continuing claims rose 4,000 to 1.955 million, close to its 3.5 year high set four week ago:On the more important for forecasting YoY basis, initial claims were down -8.1%, and the four week average down -4.1%. Only continuing claims were higher, by 5.5%:Initial claims are squarely in the middle of their range over the past 3.5 years, suggesting that very few people are getting laid off. Indeed, as a percentage of the labor force, so far this month the average is only about 0.13% of the labor force has been laid off, among the lowest p",
