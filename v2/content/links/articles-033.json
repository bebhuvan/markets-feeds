    "fullContent": "Kellogg's Agrees To Remove Artificial Dyes From All Cereals WK Kellogg is the first company to commit in a legal agreement to removing artificial dyes from its products, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Aug. 13. “I’m proud to officially say Kellogg’s will stop putting these unhealthy ingredients in its cereals,” Paxton, a Republican, said in a statement. Studies have linked the artificial dyes to health problems, including hyperactivity. Kellogg’s produces a variety of cereals, including Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes. They currently contain dyes such as Red 40 and Yellow 5. As Zachary Stieber reports for The Epoch Times, Paxton began investigating Kellogg’s earlier this year for possibly violating state law by advertising cereals as healthy despite them containing the additives. “There will be accountability for any company, including Kellogg’s, that unlawfully makes misrepresentations about its food and contributes to a broken health system that has made Americans less healthy,” Paxton said in a statement in April. The investigation led to an assurance of voluntary compliance, a legal document that certifies that the company is committed to removing artificial colorings from its cereals by the end of 2027. A spokesperson for Kellogg’s told The Epoch Times in an email on Aug. 14 that the company appreciates the chance to work with the office of the Texas attorney general. The spokesperson confirmed that Kellogg’s will remove the artificial dyes from its products by the end of 2027. “We see the growing focus on health as an opportunity to meet consumer needs in even more meaningful ways,” the spokesperson said. The company has said that 85 percent of its cereal sales contain no artificial dyes, and that it long ago removed Red No. 3, which federal regulators in January said they were banning. Regulators later banned two additional dyes—Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B. They stopped short of banning the other allowed artificial colors, saying they wanted to work with companies to voluntarily remove them. After the announcement, on April 28, a Kellogg’s spokesperson told The Epoch Times that it was reformulating its cereals served in schools so that they would not contain the dyes, and that it would not launch any new products with the dyes effective January 2026. At the time, the company also said it was working with federal officials to figure out ways to “effectively remove” dyes from the products that still contain them, but did not commit to a timeline for the removal. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during a meeting in March that featured an executive from Kellogg’s that companies have two years to remove the dyes.

    "fullContent": "DOE Taps 10 Advanced Reactor Companies For Expedited Nuclear Pilot By Robert Walton of Utility Dive, Summary: The U.S. Department of Energy on Tuesday selected 11 advanced reactor projects to participate in a nuclear pilot program that aims to expedite deployment without Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing, according to a June request for applications. DOE wants to achieve criticality of at least three test reactors using an expedited authorization process by July 4, 2026. Oklo and its Atomic Alchemy subsidiary were selected to develop three of the projects. DOE “is opening the door to the market so new ideas, new approaches, and new designs can be built more quickly and efficiently,” Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte said in a statement. DOE unveiled its reactor pilot program in June, building on a May executive order signed by President Donald Trump that reformed reactor testing. The program aims to expedite testing of reactor designs authorized by DOE and located outside of the national laboratories. DOE cited the Atomic Energy Act’s authorization of reactors under the agency’s “sufficient control,” in authorizing the pilot. “Reactors built and operated pursuant to the DOE pilot program will not require Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing,” the June request for applications said. “Nevertheless, DOE-approved reactor designs can and will be fast tracked for future NRC licensing. ... [The pilot will] provide a fast track to an NRC license, and hence, commercialization for authorized reactor design.” DOE on Tuesday named 10 companies that could access a “fast-tracked approach to future commercial licensing activities.” They are: Aalo Atomics; Antares Nuclear; Atomic Alchemy; Deep Fission; Last Energy; Oklo; Natura Resources; Radiant Industries; Terrestrial Energy; and Valar Atomics. Each company will be responsible for all costs associated with designing, manufacturing, constructing, operating, and decommissioning their test reactors, the DOE said. “Seeking DOE authorization provided under the Atomic Energy Act will help today’s selected companies ... unlock private funding and provide a fast-tracked approach to future commercial licensing activities,” it said in a release. DOE Deputy Secretary of Energy James Danly said in a statement that the agency will “do everything we can” to support the companies’ aim of “safely” achieving criticality by July 4, 2026. “This shows that the DOE is ushering in a new era of building new nuclear in America by unleashing its unique capabilities to enable American nuclear innovators to build,” Oklo’s DeWitte said. “DOE’s selection of a number of projects provides a sweeping injection of urgency to meet the moment.” DOE tapped Oklo for two projects and its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy, was selected for a third. Oklo completed its acquisition of the radioisotope producer in March. While nuclear boosters have hailed DOE’s pilot program, critics say the lack of NRC licensing requirements creates safety risks. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, in May criticized the White House’s plan to move nuclear reactor siting, licensing and fuel supply for some projects outside the NRC. “By fatally compromising the independence and integrity of the NRC, and by encouraging pathways for nuclear deployment that bypass the regulator entirely, the Trump administration is virtually guaranteeing that this country will see a serious accident or other radiological release that will affect the health, safety and livelihoods of millions,” Lyman said.

    "summary": "Trump Signs Order Easing 'Restrictive' Space Industry Rules Authored by Melanie Sun via The Epoch Times, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 13 to ease regulations for the commercial space industry and enhance “American greatness in space.",
    "fullContent": "Trump Signs Order Easing 'Restrictive' Space Industry Rules Authored by Melanie Sun via The Epoch Times, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 13 to ease regulations for the commercial space industry and enhance “American greatness in space.” The order directs Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to work on streamlining the license and permitting process for commercial launch and reentry vehicles to “eliminate outdated, redundant, or overly restrictive rules,” according to a White House fact sheet. This includes actions to “eliminate or expedite Department of Transportation’s environmental reviews” and other processes deemed to be unnecessary. Licensing is administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The order emphasised the need to enable a “competitive launch marketplace” and substantially increase “commercial space launch cadence and novel space activities by 2030.” “Ensuring that United States operators can efficiently launch, conduct missions in space, and reenter United States airspace is critical to economic growth, national security, and accomplishing Federal space objectives,” the president said in the order. In reforms for rocket safety, Trump ordered the streamlining of regulations that overlap with existing safeguards already in place for vehicles, such as flight termination systems, automated flight safety systems, and Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness certificates. He also directed the Department of Transportation to investigate whether requirements for rocket permits should be expanded to ensure that operators can demonstrate the reliability of their reentry vehicles to “protect against a high-consequence event on reentry.” The transportation secretary has 120 days to implement the order, which includes reporting on any new assessments or changes made to the president’s economic policy team. Earlier this year, the FAA grounded SpaceX’s Starship test flights for nearly two months after back-to-back post-launch explosions rained debris over Caribbean islands and forced dozens of airliners to change course. The FAA expanded the aircraft hazard zone along Starship’s launch trajectories before licensing future flights. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly complained that licensing reviews required by the FAA, post-flight mishap investigations, and environmental impact studies needlessly slowed testing of SpaceX’s Starship rocket, which was under development at the company’s South Texas launch facility. Starship is the centerpiece of Musk’s long-term SpaceX business model, as well as a core component of NASA’s ambitions for returning astronauts to the moon’s surface, establishing a permanent human lunar presence, and ultimately sending crewed missions to Mars. State Government Approval Trump also directed the secretaries of commerce, defense, transportation, and the NASA administrator to examine whether state and local governments comply with the Coastal Zone Management Act when it comes to regulating spaceport infrastructure projects. The cabinet members and NASA head are to report their findings to the Department of Justice, as well as advise on whether reforms should be made to revoke the need for state approval for such projects. They have a 180-day deadline. The policy document also ordered the expediting and streamlining of existing regulatory frameworks involved in authorizing unmanned space missions to “enable American space competitiveness and superiority,” and the creation of a new Department of Transportation role in which a “senior executive noncareer employee” will oversee “innovation and deregulation in the commercial space transportation industry.” The order also directs the secretary of commerce to elevate the Office of Space Commerce to a secretary-level office within 60 days.
