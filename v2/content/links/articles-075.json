    "fullContent": "'Lawfare At Its Finest': Biden's DOJ Secretly Targeted Trump's Inner Circle Authored by Matt Margolis via PJMedia.com, There are new, disturbing revelations about the weaponization of the federal government against former Trump officials that demand attention. Just weeks before returning to the White House, officials who served President Donald Trump during his first term discovered they had been swept up in a politically charged dragnet under orders from the Biden administration. Google, following a legal process that the FBI triggered, quietly collected personal information from their accounts, only alerting the targets after the fact, and only because the court-imposed gag order had finally lifted. Dan Scavino, now White House Deputy Chief of Staff, received one of these anonymous yet chilling notifications from Google. ‚ÄúGoogle received and responded to a legal process issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation compelling the release of information related to your Google account. A court order previously prohibited Google from notifying you of the legal process‚Ä¶‚Äù The Orwellian undertone cannot be missed. Scavino described it as ‚ÄúBiden lawfare‚Äù in action, calling it ‚Äúa small taste of the INSANITY that many of us went through‚Äîright here in the United States of America. LAWFARE at its finest. A Complete and Total Disgrace!!!!!‚Äù Imagine patriotically and proudly serving in the first Trump White House for four years, and departing in January of 2021 . . . Then, during the four years you're out, BIDEN LAWFARE kicks in, and you receive the below email five weeks before re-entering the White House again in‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Dan Scavino Jr.üá∫üá∏ü¶Ö (@DanScavino) August 1, 2025 According to Fox News Digital, soon after Scavino‚Äôs post, Kash Patel, who now serves as FBI Director, revealed he too received one of these covert warnings. This wasn‚Äôt a one-off; this was a coordinated campaign of intimidation. Jeff Clark, acting administrator at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, also stepped forward, stating he got a similar message. ‚ÄúIndeed, a whole Jack Smith team was assigned to go through my emails after there was a privilege review.‚Äù Clark didn‚Äôt stop there; he exposed how the ‚Äúgroup of lawyers ignored my religious pastor privilege, marital privilege, and other privileges and basically shipped all they could to Jack Smith. But it still cost me tens of thousands to try to protect my communications.‚Äù Smith, the former special counsel whom Merrick Garland handpicked, got the green light to relentlessly pursue Donald Trump and his allies through a series of politically charged investigations. His mandate? To criminalize Trump‚Äôs efforts to challenge the highly questionable 2020 election results and, later, to go after him over the possession of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, despite a long history of former officials handling such matters without prosecution. Smith‚Äôs team rolled through personal data with utter disregard for privacy and protected communication. ‚ÄúMy medical records and other private communications had nothing to do with the 2020 election,‚Äù Clark said. ‚ÄúThey were no one's business. But it didn't matter to these thugs with law degrees and the willingness to abuse government power.‚Äù This was vengeance dressed up in legal jargon. And once again, we‚Äôre staring down undeniable proof that under Biden‚Äôs watch, the law wasn‚Äôt blind; it was a weapon aimed squarely at his political enemies. The administration didn't treat the Constitution as a safeguard but as an obstacle to ignore. Those who dared to challenge the regime were met not with due process, but with the full force of a weaponized federal machine. This is the legacy of the Left‚Äôs ‚Äújustice‚Äù: intimidate, isolate, and destroy. Stunned by this chilling government overreach? You‚Äôre not alone‚Äîthese revelations highlight how far the Left will go to silence dissent. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 14:05",

    "fullContent": "Shale Giant Diamondback Slashes CapEx Again Ahead Of Crude Supply Flood Three months ago, then-CEO of Diamondback Travis Stice made waves when he declared that US shale-oil production had peaked, a forecast that shook the industry. It was also accurate (for now): since then, domestic crude drilling activity has dropped by 12% to the lowest in almost four years. The CEO also took the rational and prudent step of slashing the Permian shale giant's capex spending amid the ever growing OPEC+ price war, instead of engaging in a race to the bottom. Fast forward to today when the largest independent Permian Basin oil driller is now warning of a bearish influx of crude supplies to global markets in coming months. In preparation, Diamondback Energy is cutting even more capex - $100 million to be precise - narrowing its output forecast and delaying some fracking work. The moves announced Monday by the company's new CEO Kaes Van‚Äôt Hof are, like three months ago, defensive in nature and aimed at avoiding the trap of boosting production when there‚Äôs a risk of weaker prices in a well-supplied market. In a letter to shareholders, Van‚Äôt Hof never mentioned the OPEC+ alliance. He didn‚Äôt need to: the cartel has been hammering oil markets with a series of supply increases despite bleak demand signals that combined to sent US crude down 17% since mid-January. ‚ÄúThe projected increase in global oil supply in the second half of this year is hard to ignore,‚Äù the CEO wrote. ‚ÄúTherefore, we have set up our business for the rest of 2025 to hold oil volumes flat while cutting spending.\" Diamondback also reported weaker profit in the second quarter of 2025, despite growing revenue and increasing production during the period. The Midland, Texas-based oil and gas company said net income attributable to the company fell 16% to $699 million in the second quarter ended June 30, down from $837 million a year earlier. Yet total revenue increased 48% to $3.68 billion from $2.48 billion, and production surged with daily combined volumes growing 94% to 919,879 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from 474,670. The problem is that total costs and expenses also spike, rising 91% to $2.54 billion from $1.33 billion. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 13:45",
