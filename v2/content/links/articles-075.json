Brennan openly accused DNI Tulsi Gabbard of lying even though the documents are declassified for all to read. And he did this with Jen Psaki, the former Biden Press Secretary. On Wednesday John Brennan went on with Jen Psaki to lash out at Tulsi Gabbard, accusing her of lying. Two Obama admin liars lying about lying, running cover for a hoax.

Acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea accused Beijing of covertly aiding Moscow's military machine, and urged China to \"stop fueling Russia’s aggression\" in Ukraine. Washington has long suspected Beijing of intentionally shipping dual civilian-military goods in order to prop up Russia's defense industrial sector. \"Beijing’s claim to have implemented strong export controls on dual-use goods falls apart in the face of daily recovery of Chinese-produced components in the drones, weapons, and vehicles that Russia uses against Ukraine,\" Ambassador Shea said.

    "summary": "Bezos Dumps $5.7 Billion In Amazon Stock. Now CNBC Buyout Rumors Swirl Jeff Bezos has generated billions of dollars in Amazon stock sales since late June under a 10b5-1 plan. The divestitures coincide with a new report suggesting he's mulling over a potential acquisition of CNBC. According to Bloomberg data, Bezos has been on a selling spree since late June, capitalizing on Amazon's stock rebound from its April lows. So far, the sales have generated $5.7 billion for the billionaire. Here's more from the Bloomberg report: The sales, which began when Bezos unloaded $737 million around his weekend nuptials in Venice, were part of a trading plan for up to 25 million shares that he adopted earlier this year. He sold the last of the 25 million on Wednesday and Thursday, divesting about 4.2 million shares for $954 million, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Friday. Amid Bezos' dumping of stock under the 10b5-1 plan, a new report emerged last week from The New York Pos",

A Chinese hydrology expert has described the project as outright illegal, pointing out that it violates multiple international agreements and China’s environmental laws. The estimated $167 billion project, formally known as the Motuo Hydropower Station, is situated on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. It is set to become the world’s largest hydroelectric dam, with a projected annual output of 300 billion kilowatt-hours. On July 19, Chinese Premier Li Qiang attended the groundbreaking ceremony, referring to it as the “project of the century,” according to Chinese state media.

He added, “There is exasperation at Zelensky in the donor community.” Early last week, there were unexpected images coming from Kiev of the largest demonstrations against the Ukrainian government since Russia invaded more than three years ago, as more than 2,000 people gathered near the president's office, shouting \"shame\" and \"veto the law,\" after President Zelensky signed a law gutting the country's anti-corruption agency.

The pact comes less than a week before a Friday deadline for President Donald Trump’s higher tariffs to take effect on August 1. The president in May threatened to impose a 50% duty on nearly all EU goods, adding pressure that accelerated negotiations, before lowering that to 30%. Trump made the announcement at Trump Turnberry, his seaside golf resort in western Scotland, after meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who leads the EU’s executive body. 🚨BREAKING: President Trump lands EU trade deal: - EU to purchase $750 billion in US and invest $600 billion in US - EU to purchase a “vast amount” of military equipment - EU opens up markets ",

President Trump’s signature piece of legislation allocated $3.3 billion to the DOJ, some of which will go toward the Byrne-JAG Grant Program, a federal initiative created in 2005 which provides support for local law enforcement and criminal justice efforts. To access the new funds, which supplement the $499 million already appropriated for the Byrne-JAG program in 2025, localities must comply with a section of federal immigration law that forbids them from restricting communication between their law enforcement entities and the Department of Homeland Security regarding an individual’s immigration status.

There were also instances of drowning as aid was dropped into the sea during the 2024 efforts. For example a single day in March of last year saw 18 people die trying to desperately access the aid. But given that at this point scores of people are dying each day from hunger, air drops are increasingly a risk everyone (or Western countries) is willing to take - even as Israel's military is still exercising a tight grip on what aid is allowed into Gaza and who distributes it.
