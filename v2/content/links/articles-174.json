    "fullContent": "CDC Reveals Children Have Highest Intake Of Ultra-Processed Foods 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) coverage in the corporate media has spiked in recent days, marking one of the highest story counts in months. The timing isn't a coincidence, given that the 'back to school' season is fast approaching and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is preparing to roll out new national dietary guidelines next month. On Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a new nutrition survey showing that Americans receive more than half of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods, with salty and sugary items making up an even larger share of children's diets. This heavily processed diet is fueling America's health crisis. Here are the highlights from the CDC's new report titled \"Ultra-processed Food Consumption in Youth and Adults: United States, August 2021–August 2023\": Overall: Americans aged 1+ consumed 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. Youth (ages 1–18): Averaged 61.9%, with the highest intake in children aged 6–11 (64.8%). Adults (19+): Averaged 53%, with intake decreasing as age increases (down to 51.7% for those 60+). Top sources: Sandwiches (incl. burgers), sweet bakery goods, savory snacks, sweetened beverages, pizza (for youth), and breads/tortillas (for adults). CDC explained, \"Ultra-processed foods tend to be hyperpalatable, energy-dense, low in dietary fiber, and contain little or no whole foods, while having high amounts of salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats. Ultra-processed food consumption has been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.\" Here are the ultra-processed food groups that were top sources of calories among youth and adults... The findings support Secretary Kennedy's move to revise U.S. dietary guidelines and reduce reliance on the processed foods industrial complex. On Monday, Secretary Kennedy and others celebrated \"MAHA Monday\" with the announcement that six more states have agreed to remove junk food from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Speaking at the press conference earlier this week at the White House, Secretary Kennedy said, \"Taxpayer dollars shouldn't go to junk food that makes our kids sick. We're fixing that—state by state, step by step—to Make America Healthy Again.\" Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 05:45",

    "fullContent": "Nearly 10,000 Killed In Syria Since 'Diversity-Friendly Jihadists' Seized Power Via The Cradle The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has documented the violent deaths of nearly 10,000 people in Syria since the former ISIS commander, Ahmad al-Sharaa, was installed in power in Damascus. After Sharaa toppled the government of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in December last year, he was widely praised. An article in the UK's Telegraph described his armed group, the former Al-Qaeda affiliated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), as \"diversity friendly jihadists\". Getty Images Since that time, his HTS-led security forces have gone on a killing spree targeting Syria's minority groups. SOHR reported on 7 August that \"due to ongoing violence and violations by local and foreign actors, coupled with widespread security chaos,\" at least 9,889 people have been killed since 8 December 2024, the day Damascus fell. The SORH said that 7,449 civilians were among the victims, including 396 children and 541 women. It also stressed that there has been no accountability for killings carried out by members of Syria's security forces and affiliated armed factions, while “in some cases, perpetrators are being covered up and facts are being distorted.” The SOHR noted, for example, that the fact-finding committee formed to investigate the massacre of roughly 1,600 Alawite civilians in Syria's coastal regions in March “did not provide results consistent with the facts,” and was released while government forces and affiliated factions were carrying out new massacres of Druze civilians in Suwayda. At the same time, pro-government media have launched campaigns aimed at undermining any groups seeking to document or expose the human rights violations, including by “disseminating sectarian and inflammatory rhetoric” against specific religious minority groups. For example, media campaigns have been launched to deflect from the massacres by calling Alawites “remnants of the regime” of Bashar al-Assad, calling the Druze “collaborators” with Israel, and calling the Kurds “separatists.” In many videos posted online, Syrian government-affiliated fighters regularly refer to both Alawites and Druze as “pigs” before executing them in their homes and the street. The SOHR stated as well that thousands of detainees – who have not had a proper trial or been allowed to appear before a judge – remain in prison. Among the detainees are people arrested after the fall of Assad, and others who were arrested during raids or at security checkpoints. Many of these detainees have no clear charges against them and are being arbitrarily detained without due process, SOHR added.

An inspiration to us all. pic.twitter.com/mjANpLoPQP — Lindsey Snell (@LindseySnell) August 6, 2025 On 5 August, SOHR reported that families of kidnapped civilians renewed calls for Syrian authorities to reveal the fate of young Alawite men taken from their homes without charges during the massacres on the coast in March. The missing detainees are from the villages of Hmeimim, Bustan al-Basha, Al-Qabo, and Al-Sanober. Families told SOHR activists that armed groups stormed houses and took the young men to an unknown location without explaining the reasons or issuing official arrest warrants. Since then, Syrian authorities have provided no information about their fate despite repeated demands from their families. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 05:00",
