The least understood issue right now, is how isolated and alone Tulsi Gabbard is on her mission to bring sunlight to the Intelligence Community weaponization and corruption. …”There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things”… The IC uses various media leaks and narrative engineers as the tools against their enemy; in this case DNI Tulsi Gabbard. The most common arrow in their manipulative quiver is the term “sources and methods.” The Washington Post notes how the Intelligence Community is upset about DNI Tulsi Gabbard compromising their ‘sources and methods’ by releasing the House Intelligence Report that deconstructed the Russiagate Intelligence Community Assessment. What has them so upset is Tulsi’s release of the House Intel report. This is the report that drove the FBI to raid Mar-a-Lago in an effort to retrieve it from Trump. This is the report that outlines how the CIA fabricated the Russiagate claims. Tulsi is being targeted for releasing this specific report. That tells you how important it is to the CIA. WASHINGTON DC – […] The document that Gabbard ordered released on July 23 is a 46-page report stemming from a review begun in 2017 by majority Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. It takes issue with U.S. intelligence agencies’ finding earlier that year that Russian President Vladimir Putin developed a preference for Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton and aspired to help him win the election. […] The House report is the most sensitive document the Trump administration has yet released, and details of how its publication occurred have not been previously reported. […] The document contains multiple references to CIA human sources reporting on Putin’s plans. Such sources are among the agency’s most closely guarded secrets. After the report was completed in 2020, it was considered so sensitive that it remained in storage at the CIA rather than on Capitol Hill. […] as the Trump administration prepared to release the report publicly, there were multiple versions of it circulating, some with more redactions to protect sensitive information, current and former U.S. officials said. Gabbard, who has led the administration’s effort to relitigate the 2016 campaign, pushed to release as much as possible, they said. “CIA put forward their proposed redactions and edits to the document,” said a person familiar with the process. Gabbard “has greater declassification authority than all other intelligence elements and is not required to get their approval prior to release.” Trump then approved the publication of the version from Gabbard’s office “with minimal redactions and no edits,” this person said. […] It is unclear exactly how Trump gave his approval, or if he examined the competing versions of the House report beforehand. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. (READ MORE) ~ The HPSCI Report is Here ~ The HPSCI report release is what is driving the CIA bananas. Despite efforts by Donald Trump to declassify the HPSCI report before leaving office, the CIA never released it. No one except the internal Intelligence Community (CIA/DNI) had seen the HPSCI report until Tulsi Gabbard released it on July 22nd. This is a key point, because the HPSCI report touches on all of the other declassified evidence recently released. The authors of the HPSCI report had reviewed all of the same information John Durham reviewed. The HPSCI report walks through the entire construct of the Intelligence Community Assessment ordered by President Obama on December 6, 2016. Arguably, because of the underlying evidence reviewed to produce it, the HPSCI report is the most critical of the declassified release in the last few months. The HPSCI report walks through the timeline, as the ICA was created between early to late December 2016. Do NOT forget. Tulsi Gabbard is essentially all alone on this mission of sunlight. Tulsi’s isolation is the one issue people do not quite seem to understand. Pam Bondi (AG) isn’t with her. Director Kash Patel (FBI) and Director John Ratcliffe (CIA) are not with her. Susie Wiles (CoS) is not with her. In all of these efforts DNI Tulsi Gabbard is all alone. The Israel-First media and activist group is also aligned against her. If you doubt that’s the scenario, show me a single voice from inside the administration who stood up to (even gently) defend her when Tulsi was attacked about her position on the Iran nuclear capabilities. Tulsi is all alone. She is all alone on this mission and even physically all alone when on task within the administration. Watch for it and you can clearly see it. Once you see it, you cannot unsee it. This is not about President Trump per se’. The Office of the President is not a significant participant at the moment, and those who control power within the Oval Office keep Tulsi isolated and away from the President. However, if DNI Tulsi Gabbard turns against Palantir, she will be removed. Full stop. We saw those Palantir boundary rails surface when DNI Gabbard was not fully behind the bombing of Iran. People argue against the power of the ODNI, saying the office is a functionary only. These are historically old arguments by people who do not fully understand the nature of the silo system. Yes, this is the typical viewpoint; however, readers on these pages will note that I have said repeatedly for years now, the DNI position can be used for powerfully good purposes. The DNI can look at anything in Washington DC. Anything, inside any silo. As noted by the angered WaPo, “Gabbard has greater declassification authority than all other intelligence elements and is not required to get their approval prior to release.” The DNI can look at anything in any silo and put sunlight upon it. Yet, people claim the DNI has no power. lol The ability to bring sunlight is power. Go Tulsi! Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 22:35",

    "fullContent": "Trump To Nominate Long-Time Labor Statistics Critic As Head Of BLS Just over a week after Trump's shocking termination of BLS head, Erika McEntarfer (a 2023 Biden appointee), following a weak jobs report which saw the biggest negative revision outside of covid and prompted Trump to allege that the agency’s economic data was “rigged\", the president announced on Monday that he plans to nominate E.J. Antoni, the chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The position requires Senate confirmation. Antoni, a longtime critic of the agency’s handling of jobs data and fervent booster of ZeroHedge and our data on X, had the support of conservatives like former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. “Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” Trump posted Monday to Truth Social. “I know E.J. Antoni will do an incredible job in this new role.” Antoni’s nomination is the latest indication that the president wants to see a major makeover to the agency. As a quick look at @RealEJAnthony X account shows, he has been almost as critical of BLS data manipulation as ZeroHedge, which is why we shudder to think what the next jobs report will look like if the new BLS commissioner decides to kitchen sink all the accumulated BS. One thing is for certain: a negative 10 million jobs report will certainly accelerate Fed rate cuts, and send both gold and crypto to the moon, more or less literally. While the BLS is an independent agency under the Labor Department which is responsible for measuring and analyzing data on jobs, wages, and the economy, including the monthly jobs report, and helps paint a picture of America’s overall economic health, its data has come in under stark attack in recent years due to massive (mostly downward) revisions in recent years, most notably the near record 818K negative revision in August of 2024, which prompted the September 50bps rate cut by the Fed, viewed by many as a political (if ultimately futile) intervention by the central bank to boost Kamala Harris' chances of election. The BLS came under fire after Trump and some of his allies accused it of politicizing revisions to recent jobs reports. And while everyone knows that the BLS is in charge of the jobs numbers, fewer are aware that the BLS also cooks the inflation books, so to speak, and is the agency responsible for the CPI report... such as the one that drops at 8:30am tomorrow and will shape monetary policy well into 2026. Finally, if Trump indeed intends to politicize the BLS, expect an epic miss in tomorrow's CPI report. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 22:10",

    "fullContent": "Know-Your-Customer: Crypto's Quiet Kill-Switch Authored by 'Ghost Ghost' via BitcoinMagazine.com, The know-your-customer (KYC) threat isn’t coming. It’s already here, and it didn’t arrive through a nationwide ban or an emergency executive order. It quietly showed up with a checkbox and a Terms of Service agreement. While the influencers make noise about CBDCs and paper bitcoin, the real control system has already been deployed: Know Your Customer. Not dramatic. Not dystopian. Just regulated, normalized and accepted. But compliance isn’t neutral. It’s the infrastructure of financial control, and if you’re still handing over your ID to stack sats, you’re not buying freedom. You’re financing your own cage. The Real Attack Vector from KYC KYC regulations are marketed as a hedge against money laundering and fraud. The framing is safety. The reality is traceability. The moment you attach your identity to Bitcoin through an exchange signup — a utility bill attached, a passport uploaded — you forfeit the very autonomy that Bitcoin was designed to preserve. It’s not about what you’re doing. It’s about who you are. Once that link is made, every transaction becomes searchable, timestamped and admissible. This isn’t a theory. It’s how the system is already working. Canada froze bank accounts based on political donations. The U.K. arrests protestors using facial recognition. The U.S. executes geofence warrants without individual suspicion. Add KYC to that apparatus, and you’ve built a turnkey surveillance machine. No subpoenas. No charges. Just silent blacklists and frozen withdrawals. Didn’t you find it odd that they arrested the developers of mixers like Whirlpool and Tornado Cash, instead of the criminals that used them? KYC is Centralization by Design Governments didn’t need to outlaw Bitcoin; they just needed to know who’s using it. The combination of centralized exchanges, KYC records and behavioral analytics turns every bitcoin purchase into a breadcrumb trail. Every withdrawal from Coinbase or Kraken becomes part of a profile logged, indexed, stored. When regulators talk about “compliance,” this is what they mean: usable data pipelines. Sanitized, labeled UTXOs. A fully mapped ecosystem of wallets tied to real names and IP addresses. What they’re building isn’t about stopping crime. It’s about preemptively labeling dissent. You Are the Honeypot The most dangerous part of KYC is that it doesn’t look dangerous. There’s no siren, no red alert. Just a few forms, a phone verification — maybe a bonus if you sign up today. But each form you complete feeds the machine. Not just for you, but for everyone you interact with. KYC isn’t just surveillance. It’s contagious. A single identity-linked wallet poisons the privacy of every address it touches. Chain analysis firms don’t need to know everyone, they just need to know someone. Once that anchor point is set, mapping becomes mathematics. You’re not stacking sats. You’re stacking evidence. Exit Is a Deadline This is the accumulation phase. The calm before the enforcement. We’re in the same pre-crackdown posture we saw before the war on cash. The pattern is familiar: Normalize surveillance Demonize privacy Criminalize autonomy The result? Most users walked themselves into a trap. Not under threat, but under convenience. The “just in case” crowd, the ones who signed up, KYC’d and hoped it wouldn’t matter, are already compromised. Not because they did something wrong, but because they let someone else decide what’s wrong. And once that line moves? They’re already inside it. “But they can’t stop me from moving my bitcoin and transacting P2P.” No one wants blacklisted coins: They’ll be radioactive and useless. What Real Privacy Requires There’s no affiliate link for real privacy. No app store solution. No 10% discount for using your ID. It looks like discipline. Friction. Small decisions that don’t scale. Buying peer-to-peer instead of custodial Mining to clean wallets Using tools that don’t log your metadata Walking away from platforms that promise speed in exchange for obedience. It’s not glamorous. But it’s the difference between ownership and permission. Final Thought Bitcoin was never supposed to be polite. It was a way out. But as we normalize compliance in exchange for access, we risk turning that exit ramp into a regulated channel. KYC is not a bureaucratic detail. It’s the quiet kill switch for sovereignty. It doesn’t matter how many sats you stack if every one of them is logged, tagged and ready for blacklist. So ask yourself: What does it mean to own something? If the answer starts with a government ID, you’re already losing. No name. No compromise. No delay. Build the exit while you still can. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 21:45",
