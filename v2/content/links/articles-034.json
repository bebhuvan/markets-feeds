    "fullContent": "Macrons Secretly Hired Investigator To Dig Up Dirt On Candace Owens French President Emmanuel Macron and First Lady Brigitte Macron have been revealed to have hired a private investigation firm to research conservative commentator Candace Owens, according to a new report from the Financial Times. The investigation comes as the French presidential couple pursues a defamation lawsuit against Owens over repeated allegations across multiple platforms that Brigitte Macron was born male. The cross-continental probe was conducted by New York-based firm Nardell & Co, which, according to the British business news outlet, attempted to uncover damaging information about Owens by scrutinizing her public statements and political connections. Investigators reportedly looked into whether the popular podcaster had any direct ties to Russian officials or business interests. While the investigation failed to establish any direct Russian connections, researchers did document Owens' online interactions with Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin. The report noted that both figures have shared each other's content on social media platforms various times. The 218-page lawsuit, filed in Delaware Superior Court last week, includes 22 separate counts against Owens, including defamation, false light invasion of privacy, and defamation by implication. The legal action centers on Owens' repeated allegations across multiple platforms that Brigitte Macron was born male. Researchers also documented her connections to other prominent conservative figures, including conservative journalist Tucker Carlson and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. \"When it comes to Brigitte Macron, abusing Emmanuel and then blaming it on Russia is an unfortunate and sinister pattern,\" Owens responded to the Financial Times report. The Macrons' attorney Tom Clare has characterized the case as straightforward defamation, stating that Owens \"both promoted and expanded on\" what he called \"discredited falsehoods originally presented by a self-proclaimed spiritual medium and so-called investigative journalist.\" According to court documents, Owens has promoted these claims through social media posts and an eight-part YouTube series titled \"Becoming Brigitte,\" which the Macrons' legal team argues has led to significant online harassment of the first lady. Court filings indicate the Macrons' representatives made multiple requests for retractions before filing the lawsuit. The presidential couple said in a joint statement that legal action became \"the only remaining avenue for remedy\" after Owens allegedly continued to promote the claims. Despite calls for retractions, Owens has stood firm in her position, declaring in a 2024 social media post that she would \"stake my entire professional reputation on the fact that Brigitte Macron is in fact a man.\" The U.S. lawsuit follows mixed results for the Macrons in French courts addressing similar allegations. In July, a Paris appeals court overturned lower court convictions against two French women who had made comparable claims about the first lady. The appellate court ruled that defendants Amandine Roy and Natacha Rey had acted in \"good faith\" despite making false claims, eliminating their financial liability for damages previously awarded to the Macrons.

    "fullContent": "US Ignores Horrific Syrian Govt Massacres Caught On Video As Sharaa Embraced In Amman Authored by Jason Ditz via AntiWar.com, The number of people killed in the massacres in Syria’s Suwayda Governorate is still yet from being fully documented, as tensions continue to flare and the whole governorate is effectively on lockdown from the government. Talks aimed at addressing concerns about that situation are scheduled for this week in Amman, Jordan. But while early reports were that a number of representatives of the Druze minority would be present for the talks, that turns out not to be the case, as the Syrian Islamist government has insisted only government representatives could participate, and therefore no Druze will be present. Tom Barrack with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, image via X That’s hugely important since the violence in Suwayda mostly involved massacres of the Druze population, and the Syrian government security forces are accused of participating in at least some of those. The talks are now scheduled to only involve Syria and Jordan’s respective foreign ministers, as well as US envoy Tom Barrack. Barrack said the talks will affirm their “collective determination to move towards a future in which Syria and all its people can live in peace, security and prosperity.” It’s not at all clear, however, that any concrete efforts will be discussed at these talks. State Department spokesman Michael Mitchell urged “restraint” in Suwayda, and warning against excessive use of force against protesters. The administration in general, however, seems to be overwhelmingly behind the Syrian government on effectively all issues, and is pushing for the Druze, the Kurdish SDF and others to voluntarily disarm so that the Islamist central government has a monopoly on arms. The Kurds have rejected those demands, and the Druze seem to be headed in that direction as well, with their religious leaders united against the Syrian government after last month’s massacres. A new video has drawn more attention to the killings in Suwayda, showing uniformed forces entering a hospital and summarily executing an unarmed man who was identified as a hospital volunteer. They had rounded up hospital staff for questioning and killed the man after he confirmed he was Druze. Before the video surfaced, state media was accusing Druze forces of carrying out the massacre at the hospital, and while this video only shows a single execution, it’s plainly by government security forces. The government is now promising an investigation into the matter. That probably won’t lead to much, as myriad promised investigations into the massacre of Alawites in northwest Syria earlier in the spring similarly were just extended until the matter was more or less dropped publicly. Both the anti-Alawite purge and the violence against the Druze led to well over 1,000 deaths, and simmering violence that has continued to rage in both cases. Bet he constantly dreamed of sitting on this special chair next to a Gulf-owned American diplomat billionaire while he was coordinating suicide bombers to hit US convoys and hiding in caves. An inspiration to us all. pic.twitter.com/mjANpLoPQP — Lindsey Snell (@LindseySnell) August 6, 2025 Since Trump met with Syria’s de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in May, the US has been overwhelmingly supportive of their position, and while noting the massacres, there is little sign they intend to pressure them in any real way to resolve the tensions with their religious minorities. The ruling Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) continues to give lip-service to the idea of being a unifying force, despite its historical ties to al-Qaeda and its present involvement in massacres, but that seems to be sufficient for the administration.

    "fullContent": "OpenAI Brings GPT-4o Back After Users Revolt Over GPT-5 Update: Updates to ChatGPT: You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people. Rate limits are now 3,000 messages/week with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 13, 2025 * * * OpenAI has brought back GPT-4o following the rollout of their latest GPT-5 model, after users complained that the new model was lame in comparison. The company advertised the new model as the \"smartest, fastest, most useful model yet,\" which uses a \"real-time router\" to switch between more efficient models for basic questions vs. deeper reasoning for more complex demands. During a Reddit AMA, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to a question by saying that GPT-5's writing quality is better than previous models - only to have several Redditors say the new model felt \"sterile\" and \"much worse\" - and answered \"briefly and dryly,\" according to engadget. \"We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways,\" Altman posted on X. The return of GPT-4o was celebrated, but there's still no guarantee that OpenAI will keep its older model around indefinitely. In the same X post, Altman said that OpenAI \"will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for.\" In the meantime, OpenAI is focusing on finishing the GPT-5 rollout and making changes that will \"make it warmer.\" However, for users who have grown attached to GPT-4o as more than just an AI chatbot, this could be the beginning of the end. OpenAI called GPT-5 a 'significant upgrade' which used PhD-level intelligence and amazing coding skills, only for users to immediately complain. \"I’ve been trying GPT5 for a few days now. Even after customizing instructions, it still doesn’t feel the same. It’s more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,\" wrote one Redditor. \"Kill 4o isn’t innovation, it’s erasure.\" \"Sure, 5 is fine—if you hate nuance and feeling things,\" wrote another user. On Friday, Altman took to X to say that the company would keep the previous model running for Plus users, and promised to implement fixes to improve GPT-5's performance and user experience. Altman also promised to double GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, saying \"We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback.\" As Wired notes further; The backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion. In March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o, after it became too sycophantic. “It seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more \"business\" and less chatty,” says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. “I personally think of that as a good thing because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing, and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.” h/t Capital.news Tyler Durden Tue, 08/12/2025 - 16:40",

    "fullContent": "Newsflash: Governments Lie Authored by Ron Paul via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace & Prosperity, Bureau of Labor Statistics head Dr. Erika McEntarfer is one of the latest persons President Trump has told “you’re fired.” President Trump said this month that he fired Dr. McEntarfer because the president believed she manipulated jobs data. Manipulations, he stated, include the updated May and June BLS numbers showing the U.S. economy created 258,000 fewer jobs than originally reported, as well as the weaker than expected July jobs report. All of this, the president suggested, was designed to make President Trump look bad. Following Dr. McEntarfer’s firing, many commenters worried that President Trump’s actions would create the perception that government unemployment and inflation data is manipulated to produce the numbers desired by the president. A loss of confidence in government statistics could impact demand for US Treasuries. This is because the value of Treasuries is adjusted based on the BLS-issued Consumer Price Index (CPI). If investors don’t trust the CPI figures, they can demand higher returns, increasing government’s interest payments. President Trump is correct that BLS manipulates statistics related to the economy, but it has been doing so since long before Donald Trump moved to the White House. For example, starting in 1994, the BLS stopped including “discouraged” workers who have stopped looking for work in the official unemployment figures. The BLS also includes those working part-time as employed even if the only reason they are working part-time is they cannot find full-time work. According to John Williams, publisher of the website Shadow Stats, including discouraged and part-time workers who want full-time work in the unemployment figures increases the unemployment rate by almost 20 percent! The government also understates the effects of inflation. One way it does this is by using “chained CPI.” Chained CPI means that even if price inflation has made steak unaffordable for most Americans, the government does not consider their standard of living lowered if they can buy a “substitute” such as hamburger. This ignores the fact that if consumers viewed hamburger and steak as equivalent then they would likely have chosen cheaper hamburger before Federal Reserve-caused price inflation made steak unaffordable, leaving them no choice but to purchase hamburger. According to John Williams’s Shadow Stats, using a more accurate definition of inflation would increase the inflation rate to as much as 12 percent. Manipulating the unemployment and inflation rates allows the government to gaslight the people into believing that the economy is strong and any signs of weakness — such as rising prices or an increase in unemployment in their town — are anomalies that do not reflect the economy’s real condition. Manipulating the inflation figures to understate the true amount of inflation also lowers the “cost of living” increases the government must provide for veterans, beneficiaries of Social Security, and others. This provides a way for government to cut spending without Congress members having politically difficult votes President Trump has done a service by highlighting that government statistics regarding the economy are manipulated. Many of those criticizing President Trump for endangering the “credibility” of government’s inflation and unemployment numbers are either unaware of, or more likely have no problem with, manipulating data to fool the public into thinking the welfare-warfare system and the fiat money system are “working.” They only object to manipulating the data to benefit President Trump. President Trump should ensure the government’s unemployment and inflation figures are as accurate as possible by appointing John Williams of Shadow Stats to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
