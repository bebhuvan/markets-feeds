    "summary": "We study whether Algorithmic Market Makers using Q-learning produce competitive or supra-competitive prices in a quote-driven asset market. We show, through simulations and analytically, that the result depends on the way the algorithm is set up. A basic Q-learning algorithm leads to loss-free prices and is, therefore, not fit for trade. Carefully choosing the exploration and learning parameters leads to less extreme prices, but still far away from the competitive ones. When we endow the algorithm with a basic understanding of the market and basic information about outstanding quotes, the Q-learning algorithms produce competitive prices.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20459",
    "summary": "How does the expansion of commodity export production impact the skill premium in a developing colonial economy? In this paper, we examine this question by relating sugar and coffee production – two key exports – to the relative wage of skilled to unskilled workers in early twentieth-century Java, Indonesia. Drawing on a newly-constructed dataset of regionally-disaggregated production figures and wages, we find a positive relationship between sugar production and the skill premium, but no relationship between coffee production and the skill premium. Using several instruments exploiting exogenous variation in global market prices and local production suitability, we find evidence for a causal effect of sugar production on the skill premium. Specifically, we estimate that a 10% increase in sugar production boosted the skill premium by about 10-11%. A substantial amount of skilled labour was involved in commodity production processes, in particular that of sugar, but there was a general s",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20458",
    "summary": "Rational individuals who obtain a premium by passing an imprecise test change their choice of costly competence when the pass threshold varies. At given premium that reaction prevents variation of the failure rate completely if the marginal cost of competence is constant, only partially if it is increasing. The offsetting effect of endogenous competence is stronger when the pass premium varies in the same direction as the threshold, as it plausibly does when in equilibrium it depends on the expected competence differential between otherwise unobservably heterogeneous individuals who pass and fail. Failure rates remain very similar as different thresholds elicit different endogenous competence, and depend much more strongly on the test's precision: the outcome of a frequently failed test must be very random from the point of view of those who take it.",

    "summary": "This paper studies how artificial intelligence (AI) affects the finance labor market when humans and AI perform different tasks in investment projects, and workers earn agency rents that grow with project size. We identify two key effects of AI improvement: A freeriding effect raises worker rents by increasing the probability of successful investment when the worker shirks; A capital reallocation effect shifts investment toward workers with higher or lower rents, depending on which tasks AI improves. Contrary to standard predictions, AI can raise both worker rents and labor demand. We derive implications for capital allocation, labor demand, compensation, and welfare.",

    "summary": "Do trade dependencies leave countries vulnerable to geopolitical coercion? We study the economic costs of trade and financial sanctions, from 1920 to the present. We first develop a continuous measure of sanction intensity, using bilateral commodity-level data to calculate the importance of specific flows that fall under sanctions. We find that sanctions inflict relatively small costs on average: sanctioning 1% of GDP worth of imports or exports leads to approximately 0.3 percentage points of lost GDP over a 5-year period and a 0.1 percentage point increase in unemployment. However, we show that sanctions are far more costly for countries whose trade is highly concentrated, and for countries that rely heavily on exporting primary commodities. Low income and developing countries appear most vulnerable to trade sanctions, while high income financial centers and some EU countries are among the most exposed to financial sanctions.",

    "summary": "Mark Carlson, Zack Saravay, and Mary TianWe examine how primary dealers utilized repo operations conducted by the Federal Reserve from September 2019 until May 2020 and how usage affected dealer borrowing and lending. Using daily dealer-level supervisory data, we find that during normal market conditions, dealers primarily used Fed repo to expand their total repo borrowing and on-lent much of this funding to a broad variety of counterparties. However, during market stress in March 2020, dealers used Fed repo as a substitute for funding from other counterparties and focused their on-lending to affiliated counterparties. Moreover, dealers with more headroom under the Supplementary Leverage Ratio requirement used more of their Fed repo borrowing to provide intermediation in funding markets. Our results underscore the critical role that the Fed's repo operations played, especially in March 2020, by reducing dealer funding stress and enabling dealers to pass on liquidity.",

    "summary": "We consider a privately informed sender selecting a mediated communication device to influence players’ actions. In contrast to standard information design, there is no ex-ante commitment, and the communication device relies on information elicited from the informed parties. We define an informed communication equilibrium (ICE) as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium outcome of the informed mediated communication game. We show that the set of ICE is the subset of communication equilibria (CE) that yield sender payoff vectors bounded below by an equilibrium payoff vector of the silent game, under some consistent interim beliefs. The principal’s ex-ante optimal CE may not be an ICE. In sender-receiver games, the set of CE payoff vectors lies in the convex hull of the set of payoff vectors above silence. Hence, if the latter set is convex, as is the case when the sender has transparent motives, the sets of CE and ICE coincide.",

Professional traders do not produce the price bubbles observed with student subjects and aggregate private information better; bubbles also do not arise in mixed markets with traders and students trading together. Professional traders exhibit higher strategic sophistication than students as measured by their Guessing Game choices. We link strategic sophistication to trading in the financial market, and show that traders with higher levels of strategic sophistication earn higher capital gains and trading profits.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20452",
    "summary": "This paper provides econometric evidence on how exchange rates respond to tariffs. We construct a new tariff-shock database, which captures tariff-related announcements, threats and implementations by the U.S., China, the Euro Area and Canada between 2018 and 2020, and in 2025. Our shock measure accounts for both the size of tariff rates and their economic relevance. We show that exchange rates react to U.S. tariff shocks in systematically different ways depending on retaliation: the U.S. dollar (USD) appreciates if the tariff is imposed unilaterally, but depreciates if other countries retaliate. This empirical pattern resonates with the predictions of recent open-macro models with dominant currency pricing. In light of our evidence and drawing on theory, we conclude that the USD depreciation following the U.S. tariff announcement on April 2nd 2025 was not surprising. The spike in long-maturity U.S. Treasury yields was, however, more unprecedented.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20454",
    "summary": "Government spending is large, persistent, and disproportionately allocated to a select number of firms within industries through federal procurement contracts. To identify the effects on firm outcomes, we construct government spending shocks at the firm level as the difference between realized and expected contract awards. We measure expectations by tracing the allocation of each dollar to firms back to appropriations bills and exploiting predictable agency-to-firm procurement shares. Firms receiving positive government spending shocks increase markups and profitability, outperform industry peers in the stock market, and gain market share, fostering rising industry stars.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20453",
    "summary": "We investigate how fuel taxation reduces climate and pollution externalities by evaluating the world’s largest environmental tax reform. Using spatially detailed emissions data from more than 1,000 European regions in a synthetic difference-in-differences framework, we evaluate the impact of Germany’s 1999 ecological tax reform on transport-related carbon and air pollutant emissions. We document sizable aggregate reductions for all emissions, exceeding 10 percent on average per year relative to synthetic baselines. Using official damage valuations, we estimate avoided external costs of more than €100 billion, two-thirds of which stem from health benefits due to reduced air pollution. Emission reductions and associated monetized benefits are larger in lower-income regions, contrasting with a slightly regressive distribution of fuel costs. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating air quality co-benefits when evaluating the efficiency and distributional effects of fuel an",

    "summary": "This is a book that is a historical retrospective of the many key issues that Ken Rogoff researched over the last four decades. It is autobiographical as Rogoff walks through how he was engaged with many of the key topics of international finance. It was quite a run of problems: The Cold WarThe Asian currency crisisThe rise of China The issue of Japan and currency movesThe single currency in Europe All of these policy and economic issues required fundamental research to make the right choice and understand the crises being faced. Rogoff makes all of the issues approachable. The complexities are presented clearly, mixed with personal stories. If you want to understand the problems of international finance over the last few decades, you could not do better than read this book.",

    "summary": "Gold is going higher, so it must be the case that commodities are also going higher? The data tells us otherwise. Commodities, on average, have been rangebound, but the gold versus commodity ratio tells a different story. The gains in gold are the result of something different. It is driven by the demand for a safe asset, not for its use in some production process or for consumption.  Does this mean that commodity prices should see a gain in the future? There could be a general commodity rise, but it is not in the card based on a ratio. Sometimes a charge is interesting but not informative.",

When deciding whether to do something compare it with the best opportunity you have.”from farnanstreeetblog.comEvery finance decision, in fact every decision, has to be compared with the opportunity cost associated with the next best decision. Any use of time has to be compared with the next best alternative. Every decision has to be compared against other options every day. This is not supposed to drive a decision maker crazy because there are costs with changing decisions. Still, the idea of continuously measuring the opportunity cost is the basis for improving the use of time, energy, and money.",

    "summary": "I have written that the dollar decline is significant, but the fall only places the current dollar value near the long-term average. However, we need to acknowledge the extreme moves in the dollar over the last six months. The reason for the dollar decline is truly self-inflicted on the part of the US.The dollar decline is not driven by systematic factors that would have been picked up by a quant model. The trend/momentum would have called for a short signal, but the exogenous factors have not been seen in past data. Growth in the US is not below the rest of the world. There is the threat of a recession, but the numbers do not suggest lower relative growth. Inflation is still higher than desired, but again the numbers do ot suggest a dollar decline. The three areas of concern are uncertainty, trade, and debt. Usually, higher uncertainty will lead to a flight toward safety, but in this case, the uncertainty is with the US. The trade and tariff issue is real, but we lack sufficient evide",

    "summary": "This paper studies the economic impact of commodity trade fragmentation. Using a novel production and trade dataset of 48 key commodities, we develop a partial equilibrium framework to identify the most vulnerable commodities to trade disruptions and assess the ensuing economic risks. Trade fragmentation can cause large price changes for many commodities, with minerals critical for the clean energy transition and selected agricultural commodities being the most vulnerable. The economic relevance of commodity trade fragmentation, measured by changes in consumer and producer surplus, varies across countries. However, offsetting effects across commodity exporting and importing countries, imply modest global surplus losses.",
