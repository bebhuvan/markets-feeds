    "fullContent": "President Trump Is More Popular In Britain Than The British Prime Minister Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, President Trump has a higher favourability rating in Britain than Kier Starmer, the country’s leftist Prime Minister, a new poll has revealed. The City AM survey found that 26 per cent of the British public view Trump favourably. It is still firmly considered trendy among normies to publicly and loudly declare to each other that Trump is literally Hitler. However, that figure does represent a nine-point increase over the past month for Trump. 🚨 NEW | Labour PM Keir Starmer is now less popular in Britain than US President Donald Trump. 🇺🇸 Trump -31 net rating 🇬🇧 Starmer -37 net rating Via Freshwater Strategies, 1-3 August pic.twitter.com/JZCSLKBqKM — Stats for Lefties 🍉🏳️‍⚧️ (@LeftieStats) August 5, 2025 And more importantly, it’s three points higher than Starmer’s popularity rating, which stands at a paltry 23 percent, just one year after he was voted into power with a massive majority. The Labour Prime Minister has a 60 percent unfavourable rating. The poll also revealed that so-called Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch also only has a 24 percent approval rating. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage scored a 37 per cent favourability rating, which is massive in comparison. In a desperate attempt to stave off complete annihilation, Starmer’s government recently announced it is going to lower the voting age to 16, effectively allowing children to vote. Reform has made massive gains, and looks set to give Labour a run for its money at the next election, prompting Starmer to start making overtures, albeit transparently empty ones, toward those who would vote for Farage’s party. The current government has seen its popularity even among its own base fall off a cliff after breaking campaign promises, increasing taxes, mindlessly following green energy policies, and overseeing record levels of illegal migration. It’s also obsessed with further eroding free speech and going after those who spread undesirable “narratives.” Farage has also focused on the increasing lawlessness in Britain, which he urges is a precursor to societal collapse.

    "fullContent": "Swedish PM Slammed After Admitting He Uses ChatGPT To Help Run Government First we learn that doctors are using ChatGPT to treat patients. Now, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson is taking a heaping ration of Lutfisk for admitting he's been using ChatGPT to help run the government. Kin Cheung - Pool/Getty Images Speaking with a Nordic news site, Kristersson said that he sometimes asks ChatGPT for a \"second opinion\" when it comes to governance strategies. \"I use it myself quite often,\" he said, \"If for nothing else than for a second opinion. What have others done? And should we think the complete opposite? Those types of questions.\" Kristersson's comments predictably came under fire. \"The more he relies on AI for simple things, the bigger the risk of overconfidence in the system,\" Virginia Dignum, a professor of responsible artificial intelligence at Umeå University, told DiGITAL. \"It is a slippery slope. We must demand that reliability can be guaranteed. We didn’t vote for ChatGPT.\" \"Too bad for Sweden that AI mostly guesses,\" wrote Aftonbladet’s Signe Krantz. \"Chatbots would rather write what they think you want than what you need to hear.\" \"You have to be very careful,\" Simone Fischer-Hübner, a computer science researcher at Karlstad University, told Aftonbladet, noting that people shouldn't submit sensitive information to GPT. As Gizmodo opines; Krantz makes a good point, which is that chatbots can be incredibly sycophantic and delusional. If you have a leader asking a chatbot leading questions, you can imagine a scenario in which the software program’s algorithms only serve to reinforce that leader’s existing prerogatives (or to push them further over the edge into uncharted territory). Thankfully, it doesn’t seem like a whole lot of politicians feel the need to use ChatGPT as a consigliere yet. Kristersson spokesman Tom Samuelsson 'clarified' that the PM doesn't take risks in his use of AI. \"Naturally it is not security sensitive information that ends up there. It is used more as a ballpark,\" he said. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 02:45",
