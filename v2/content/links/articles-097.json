    "fullContent": "Iran Executes Man Accused Of Spying For Mossad Amid Surge In Hangings Iran on Wednesday has executed a man accused of spying for Israel, state media has confirmed, after he was allegedly caught passing information to foreign intelligence related to Iran's nuclear program. The executed man, Rouzbeh Vadi, had previously worked in one of the Islamic Republic's most \"important and sensitive organizations\" - where he gained secretive information to hand to Israel, the Iranian government claims. Illustrative image of an execution in Iran. AFP/ISNA State media says he \"committed a wide range of crimes against the country’s internal and external security, which have caused severe disruption to public order.\" \"Vadi was allegedly recruited online and met Mossad – the Israeli intelligence service – officers five times in Vienna, Austria,\" reports say. In particular, Iran's judiciary’s news outlet Mizan has reported that the information Vadi provided was used by Israel to kill a top nuclear scientist during the June 12-day war. Several military commanders and nuclear scientists were killed, also through Mossad sabotage operations which took place inside the country - likely through a ground asset like the dissident organization MEK. The last several weeks have seen court-ordered executions ramp up in Iran, as authorities say they've been busting up Mossad-connected spy rings. There was a second execution on Wednesday, involving Sunni Islamic terrorism: Separately, Iran hanged a member of the ISIL (ISIS) group on Wednesday after he was accused of plotting sabotage, Mizan also reported. Officials accused Mehdi Asgharzadeh of being a member of the group who participated in military training in Syria and Iraq before illegally entering Iran with a four-member team, who were killed in a fight with Iranian security, the news site reported. The trials of alleged spies on behalf of Israel appear to be taking place in rapid format, in military and judicial tribunals, sometimes convened in small rooms - and some were even hastily held while Israeli warplanes were still circling Iran's skies in June. Surge in hangings in Tehran... It has become clear that Israel was engaged in a massive spying and espionage campaign to pave the way for its 'Operation Rising Lion' - which is intent on destroying Iran's nuclear energy program, and possibly even accomplishing regime change. But so far both sides have held to the Trump-backed ceasefire which ended the exchange of attacks. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 23:00",

    "fullContent": "Peter Thiel-Backed Startup Aims To Revolutionize American Uranium Production Critical minerals startup General Matter announced ambitious plans this week to construct a $1.5 billion uranium enrichment facility at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in McCracken County, Kentucky, as the Trump administration seeks to reduce reliance on rare earths from China. The groundbreaking project would be the first U.S.-owned, privately developed uranium enrichment facility and marks the largest economic development initiative in Western Kentucky's history. General Matter will develop the 100-acre uranium enrichment facility on the same site originally selected 75 years ago by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission for uranium enrichment activities. The facility will produce both low enriched uranium (LEU) and high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU), materials essential for powering advanced nuclear reactors, while the company has already secured DOE contracts for both LEU and HALEU production. The project is expected to create substantial economic opportunities, generating 140 high-paying permanent jobs along with various construction positions during the development phase. Local officials, including Gov. Andy Beshar (D) and Rep. James Comer (R), praised the initiative for its potential to position Kentucky as a leader in the nuclear energy sector and attended the plant’s ceremony to break ground.

General Matter is headed up by Scott Nolan, a partner at venture capital firm Founders Fund, which led the startup’s $50 million Series A round. In a rare move, Founders Fund CEO Peter Thiel has joined the company’s board. General Matter is bringing uranium enrichment back to the United States, starting at the site where the U.S. enrichment industry was born. We’ve signed a lease with the Department of Energy to establish the nation’s first U.S.-owned, privately developed uranium enrichment… pic.twitter.com/G30a9oTxrv — General Matter (@generalmatter) August 5, 2025 President Donald Trump has taken steps to bolster domestic critical mineral development, primarily through executive actions aimed at reducing U.S. reliance on foreign imports and enhancing national security. In March, the president signed an executive order — the \"Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production” — which invokes the Defense Production Act to provide financing, loans, and investment support for domestic mining and processing projects, including a dedicated critical minerals fund managed by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation in collaboration with the Department of Defense. In April, Trump signed an additional executive order focused on offshore critical minerals, aiming to develop domestic capabilities for seabed mineral exploration and processing to counter China’s influence. China's grip on the global rare earth supply chain spans from mine to magnet, positioning Beijing as the dominant force in materials critical to everything from wind turbines to military hardware. The world's second-largest economy produces 58% of light rare earths and commands 90% of heavy rare earth output, according to the Hudson Institute. Myanmar, an ally of Beijing, supplies the remaining 10% of heavy rare earths. China's stranglehold extends well beyond raw materials. The country processes 90% of rare earth ores worldwide and controls more than 80% of the market for rare earth magnets — the refined products that power electric vehicles, defense systems and renewable energy infrastructure.
