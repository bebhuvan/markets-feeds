    "fullContent": "China Seizes Opportunity To Praise 'Beloved Brazilian Coffee' While Blasting Trump's 'Bullying' Tariffs China has quickly stepped up to defend Brazil after President Trump slapped the largest South American economy with 50% tariffs on many goods, which took effect Wednesday. China is now looking to benefit by expanding access to its market for Brazilian coffee, which one of the products hit hardest by the new trade restrictions, given the US has long ranked as the world's largest coffee importer. To underscore it is seizing on this new opportunity, China's embassy in Brasília shared a video on X that featured major food delivery company Meituan. \"And the exchange goes both ways: Brazil is also strengthening its footprint in China with its popular coffee,\" the post stated. China has this week granted export authorization to 183 additional Brazilian coffee companies, with five-year permits - something also announced by the embassy. The drink \"is becoming part of everyday life for the Chinese people,\" the embassy proclaimed further. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had declared Tuesday, \"I will call Xi Jinping, I will call Prime Minister Modi. I won’t call Putin, because he can’t travel now. But I will call many presidents.\" He's now getting some of the desired initial rebuke against the US out of his powerful BRICS friends. A Wednesday statement by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing: \"...firmly supports Brazil in safeguarding its national sovereignty and national dignity,\" and \"opposes unwarranted external interference in Brazil’s internal affairs.\" He emphasized that China backs Brazil in \"resisting the bullying imposition of tariff measures\" in a strongly-worded message while vowing to intensify cooperation among Global South countries within the BRICS framework. Wang also in a phone call with a top Lula aid communicated to the Brazilian presidencity that \"using tariffs as a weapon to suppress other countries violates the UN Charter, undermines WTO rules, and is both unpopular and unsustainable.\" China has approved 183 Brazilian coffee firms to export their products to the Chinese market, the Embassy of China in Brazil said on X. The measure took effect on July 30 and is valid for five years. @EmbaixadaChina pic.twitter.com/6vbZG58oT0 — Yicai 第一财经 (@yicaichina) August 5, 2025 Trump has in the recent past voiced criticisms of BRICS, and this week Lula has remained defiant while proposing a BRICS meeting to issue a joint response to US tariffs. Lula has stated that Trump is not \"the emperor of the world\" even if he's trying to act as such. The US has accused Lula of carrying out a \"witch hunt\" against ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently on trial related to corruption and \"coup\" activities related to rejection the election results. Brazil meanwhile may be forced to go looking for other close trade partners. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 20:30",

It’s called 107 Days, because that’s how long everyone had to endure her word salad cackling before Trump won a massive landslide victory. It’s also the same amount of time that she managed to burn through one and a half billion dollars. It also serves as her excuse as to why she lost. The title of the book is a suggestion that she didn’t have long enough to put together a winning strategy. But given she never even coherently explained one policy, one can only assume it would take her years. What do you think will be in her book? Will she finally answer the question ‘how are you different from Joe Biden?’ X user Jarvis has imagined what the content might be like, and it seems pretty accurate. Kamala's book is going to be incredible. pic.twitter.com/PoEwpHH8wF — Jarvis (@jarvis_best) August 5, 2025 Lol. A sick horse. Sold me at “witch or sick horse”.

I'm going to say yes. — Jarvis (@jarvis_best) August 5, 2025 It’s definitely real. In the sense that Harris actually wrote our dictated it? No. But it's OUR truth, and people need to respect that. — JeffDay (@JeffDay20746) August 5, 2025 Was gonna ask Grok if this is real, but it has that ring of undeniable authenticity. 😀 — Mr. Flake (@MrFlake2) August 5, 2025 As a professional novelist, it is time for me to hang it up, because I will never equal this level of literary brilliance. — Larry Correia (@monsterhunter45) August 5, 2025 Others pointed out that there are giveaways that it’s not hers.

According to a statement of Putin’s longtime foreign policy aide, Yury Ushakov, \"At the suggestion of the American side, an agreement in principle was made to hold a bilateral meeting at the highest level in the coming days.\" He laid out that the idea of a Trump-Putin-Zelensky meeting (which apparently Washington pushed for) \"for some reason was mentioned by Washington yesterday\" but \"not specifically discussed,” Ushakov added, explaining that the Russian side \"left this option completely, completely without comment.\" Meeting during Trump's first term. Sputnik/Reuters This was in reference to the intense three-hour meeting that Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff had with both Putin and his top negotiator and investment chief Kirill Dmitriev. \"We have launched work to discuss the parameters of such a meeting and the venue for it jointly with our American colleagues now,\" Ushakov said additionally. \"By the way, I’d like to note that the venue, too, has been agreed in principle and will be announced a bit later,\" he added. Putin's office has described that the interest in a face-to-face meeting, which will mark the first of Trump's second term - was mutual. One location being already floated as a possibility is the United Arab Emirates. As for a Zelensky meeting, President Trump has indicated this would happen just bilaterally soon following his sit-down with Putin. Trump had been quoted Thursday as saying \"that there will be a meeting [with Putin] very soon\" and \"that we could be ending\" the Ukraine conflict. \"We haven’t determined where [the meeting would take place], but we had some very good talks with President Putin today.\" But this is all a bit surprising as nothing has fundamentally changed in the warring sides' stances. Moscow has not backed off its maximalist war goals, and will not budge from giving up the four eastern territories it has long declared part of the Russan Federation after a popular referendum, or what was fundamentlally annexation vote. The Zelensky government hasn't issued any indication that it's ready for territorial concessions - and it even wants to keep laying claim to Crimea. Meanwhile the tariffs offensive continues, with more taking effect overnight: After months of threats, delays and extensions, President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs took effect overnight, raising the overall average tariff rate to more than 17%, its highest since the Great Depression. Everything from European Union appliances and Japanese cars to food, furniture and toys from China TVs from South Korea will be hit. However, selected oil and gas imports, along with some smartphones and goods covered by a pre-existing trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, are not affected. Trump has indicated his trade offensive won’t stop. The president said he still plans to impose import taxes on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Amid that pressure, Apple said it plans to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years amid pressure from Trump to shift its supply chain to American soil. Meanwhile, Trump hiked the tariff rate for India to 50% because of the nation’s purchases of Russian oil, and he said he could raise the European Union’s tariff level to 35% from 15% if it reneges on an investment commitment. PUTIN AND TRUMP MAY MEET IN DUBAI, UAE \"The UAE is one of the suitable places for the meeting [with Trump],\" - Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, during his meeting with UAE's Mohammed bin Zayed at the Kremlin. pic.twitter.com/HqBYnT9Enu — Russian Market (@runews) August 7, 2025 As for the upcoming meeting, Anti-Kremlin punits have accused Putin of using the whole dialogue with Washington as a way to keep stalling - all while sustaining battlefield gains - and to gain a reputational boost. They see Putin as having everything to gain with a direct meeting with Trump, in terms of global standing and domestic opinion - but he's not expected to make any significant compromise. At this point from Moscow's point of view the fate of the war is being decided, but wholly on the battlefield. Ukraine's near-daily cross-border drone attacks also means the Russian military is unlikely to take its foot of the gas pedal operationally. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 19:44",

    "fullContent": "Toyota Q1 Net Profit Plunges 37% After Trump Tariff Hit Toyota Motor expects a 1.4 trillion yen ($9.5 billion) hit to operating profit for the fiscal year ending March 2026 due to higher U.S. import tariffs, according to Nikkei Asia. The automaker revised its net profit forecast downward by 14% to 2.6 trillion yen, citing the new 25% duty imposed on Japanese car imports in April by U.S. President Donald Trump. Previously, Toyota had only factored in the impact of tariffs for April and May—estimated at 180 billion yen. The company's net profit for the April–June quarter fell 36.9% year-on-year to ¥841 billion, reflecting both the stronger yen and the increased U.S. tariff rate. “The [U.S. tariff] has risen to 15% from the previous 2.5%, which obviously has a significant impact,” said Takanori Azuma, Toyota’s chief accounting officer. “And it is a thing we are not able to control. The major challenge is to ensure that our North America business generates solid profits. The result [of a trade deal] remains tough.\" Azuma added that Toyota is exploring countermeasures. “If there is excess production capacity in the U.S., we will make use of it. ... We want to refine our operations by considering every possible scenario.” In June, Toyota raised U.S. prices by an average of $270 on new vehicles built after July 1. “We'll consider adjusting prices if there is an appropriate timing which is acceptable to our customers,” Azuma said. Despite the tariff pressure, Toyota's global sales rose 7% in Q1 to 2.4 million units, including a 12.7% increase in North America and 11.4% in Japan. North America remains Toyota’s largest market, accounting for 33% of total sales. The U.S. recently agreed to lower tariffs on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, with the new rate expected to take effect in August. Even after the 25% tariff was imposed in April, Toyota continued to increase U.S. exports: 41,573 units in May (+22.9%) and 52,745 units in June (+15.9%). First-quarter operating profit dropped 10.9% to 1.1 trillion yen, while net sales rose 3.5% to 12 trillion yen. Tariffs alone reduced operating profit by 450 billion yen. Currency fluctuations are expected to further cut profits by 725 billion yen, with rising material costs subtracting another 300 billion yen. Nikkei writes that Toyota is aiming to offset these hits through increased sales, cost cuts, and growth in parts and financial services. The automaker kept its net sales forecast unchanged at 48.5 trillion yen. Meanwhile, the company announced plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture, with operations starting in the early 2030s. Investment details are still under wraps. “Our top priority is to maintain the production base of 3 million vehicles in Japan,” Azuma said. “This is the foundation of Toyota's business... We want to work together to protect it, including through measures to stimulate domestic demand.\" Other Japanese automakers are also struggling with the tariff impact. Honda posted a Q1 operating loss of 29.6 billion yen due to U.S. tariffs and weak China sales. Mazda reported a 46 billion yen loss. Both companies are shifting focus to expand U.S. production and reroute exports from Japan. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 19:40",

    "fullContent": "Federal Judge Strikes Down California's Unconstitutional Deepfake Law Authored by Jonathan Turley, I previously criticized the California law, called the Defending Democracy from Deepfake Deception Act of 2024, as flagrantly unconstitutional. Signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, the law would have gutted free speech protections for political parodies. Now, in Kohls v. Bonta, Senior U.S. District Judge John Mendez has rebuked the state for a law that he concluded had to be rejected in its entirety as flawed to its core: “No parts of this statute are severable because the whole statute is preempted. No parts of A.B. 2655 can be salvaged.” An example of the challengers was described by the court: “Plaintiff Christopher Kohls (aka “Mr. Reagan”) is an individual who creates digital content about political figures. His videos contain demonstrably false information that include sounds or visuals that are significantly edited or digitally generated using artificial intelligence …. Plaintiff’s videos are considered by him to be parody or satire. In response to videos posted by Plaintiff parodying presidential candidate Kamala Harris and other AI generated “deepfakes,” the California legislature enacted AB 2839. AB 2839, according to Plaintiff, would allow any political candidate, election official, the Secretary of State, and everyone who sees his AI-generated videos to sue him for damages and injunctive relief during an election period which runs 120 days before an election to 60 days after an election….” Social media companies like X Corp. challenged Assembly Bill 2655, which requires certain platforms to remove “materially deceptive content” about political candidates, elections officials, and elected officers. Challengers argued that federal law gives service providers immunity from suits stemming from content created by a third party. They also argued that the law violated the First Amendment. Mendez agreed with the companies that the law “punishes [social media companies] for doing something that they’re clearly protected by [the Communications Decency Act] from doing.” Attorney Johannes Widmalm-Delphonse, representing plaintiffs the Babylon Bee and Kelly Chang Rickert, argued the required disclaimer under the law constituted compelled speech because it changes what the content creator wants to say: “A disclaimer kills the joke.” The court agreed: AB 2839 does not pass constitutional scrutiny because the law does not use the least restrictive means available for advancing the State’s interest here. As Plaintiffs persuasively argue, counter speech is a less restrictive alternative to prohibiting videos such as those posted by Plaintiff, no matter how offensive or inappropriate someone may find them. “‘Especially as to political speech, counter speech is the tried and true buffer and elixir,’ not speech restriction.” … It is a powerful statement in support of free speech. The opinion also further separates this country from the anti-free speech measures coming out of the European Union. What is interesting is how California pulled out the same old saw used by many in the anti-free speech community in claiming that common law defamation shows that speech can be curtailed. I have previously addressed that flimsy argument, including in my book The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage. The court wrote: While Defendants attempt to analogize AB 2839 to a restriction on defamatory statements, the statute itself does not use the word “defamation” and by its own definition, extends beyond the legal standard for defamation to include any false or materially deceptive content that is “reasonably likely” to harm the “reputation or electoral prospects of a candidate.” At face value, AB 2839 does much more than punish potential defamatory statements since the statute does not require actual harm and sanctions any digitally manipulated content that is “reasonably likely” to “harm” the amorphous “electoral prospects” of a candidate or elected official. Moreover, all “deepfakes” or any content that “falsely appear[s] to a reasonable person to be an authentic record of the content depicted in the media” are automatically subject to civil liability because they are categorically encapsulated in the definition of “materially deceptive content” used throughout the statute. Thus, even artificially manipulated content that does not implicate reputational harm but could arguably affect a candidate’s electoral prospects is swept under this statute and subject to civil liability. The statute also punishes such altered content that depicts an “elections official” or “voting machine, ballot, voting site, or other property or equipment” that is “reasonably likely” to falsely “undermine confidence” in the outcome of an election contest. On top of these provisions lacking any objective metric and being difficult to ascertain, there are many acts that can be “do[ne] or [words that can be] sa[id]” that could harm the “electoral prospects” of a public official or “undermine confidence” in an election Almost any digitally altered content, when left up to an arbitrary individual on the internet, could be considered harmful. For example, AI-generated approximate numbers on voter turnout could be considered false content that reasonably undermines confidence in the outcome of an election under this statute. On the other hand, many “harmful” depictions when shown to a variety of individuals may not ultimately influence electoral prospects or undermine confidence in an election at all. As Plaintiff persuasively points out, AB 2839 “relies on various subjective terms and awkwardly-phrased mens rea,” which has the effect of implicating vast amounts of political and constitutionally protected speech. Defendants further argue that AB 2839 falls into the possible exceptions recognized in U.S. v. Alvarez (2012) for lies that involve “some … legally cognizable harm.” However, the legally cognizable harms Alvarez mentions does not include the “tangible harms to electoral integrity” Defendants claim that AB 2839 penalizes. Instead, the potentially unprotected lies Alvarez cognized were limited to existing causes of action such as “invasion of privacy or the costs of vexatious litigation”; “false statements made to Government officials, in communications concerning official matters”; and lies that are “integral to criminal conduct,” a category that might include “falsely representing that one is speaking on behalf of the Government, or … impersonating a Government officer.” 567 U.S. at 719-722 (2012). AB 2839 implicates none of the legally cognizable harms recognized by Alvarez and thereby unconstitutionally suppresses broader areas of false but protected speech. Even if AB 2839 were only targeted at knowing falsehoods that cause tangible harm, these falsehoods as well as other false statements are precisely the types of speech protected by the First Amendment. In New York Times v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court held that even deliberate lies (said with “actual malice”) about the government are constitutionally protected. The Supreme Court further articulated that “prosecutions for libel on government”­—including civil liability for such libel—”have [no] place in the American system of jurisprudence.” See also Rosenblatt v. Baer (1966) (holding that “the Constitution does not tolerate in any form” “prosecutions for libel on government”). These same principles safeguarding the people’s right to criticize government and government officials apply even in the new technological age when media may be digitally altered: civil penalties for criticisms on the government like those sanctioned by AB 2839 have no place in our system of governance…. The law was struck down under the strict scrutiny standard, another expensive loss for California democrats who continue to pass impulse-buy legislation with impunity. It is only the latest assault on free speech from the left and it is unlikely to be the last. Fortunately, there remain judges like Mendez who remained tightly tethered to our constitutional values: In addition to encumbering protected speech, there is a more pressing reason to meet statutes that aim to regulate political speech, like AB 2839 does, with skepticism. To quote Justices Breyer and Alito in Alvarez, “[t]here are broad areas in which any attempt by the state to penalize purportedly false speech would present a grave and unacceptable danger of suppressing truthful speech.” In analyzing regulations on speech, “[t]he point is not that there is no such thing as truth or falsity in these areas or that the truth is always impossible to ascertain, but rather that it is perilous to permit the state to be the arbiter of truth” in certain settings. The political context is one such setting that would be especially “perilous” for the government to be an arbiter of truth in. AB 2839 attempts to sterilize electoral content and would “open[] the door for the state to use its power for political ends.” “Even a false statement may be deemed to make a valuable contribution to public debate, since it brings about ‘the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.'” When political speech and electoral politics are at issue, the First Amendment has almost unequivocally dictated that Courts allow speech to flourish rather than uphold the State’s attempt to suffocate it. Well said Judge Mendez and thank you. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 19:15",

    "fullContent": "'Hazardous Waste Sites': Homeless Camps On Seattle Private Property Spark Fines And Frustration Homeless encampments on private property in Seattle are creating costly challenges for landlords, who say they’re being penalized for issues they didn’t cause but are forced to manage, according to KOMO News. On Capitol Hill, a vacant lot on Melrose Avenue recently became overrun with tents, trash, and illegal activity, prompting numerous complaints from neighbors. \"The problems had gone on too long,\" residents said, while accusing the property owner of being slow to act. Eventually, a city inspector issued a notice of violation, giving the owner a deadline to clean and secure the site or face fines of up to $500 per day. Clean-up crews, hired by the property owner through We Heart Seattle, arrived Wednesday to clear what had become “a hazardous waste site,” according to Andrea Suarez, founder of the outreach group. “It affects the community, it affects the restaurants, and it affects the residents,” she said. The site was littered with used needles, gas canisters, and makeshift weapons. After Seattle police ordered about a dozen homeless individuals to leave the private lot, Suarez’s team helped many of them connect to services, including drug treatment and medical care. KOMO News writes that the property owner, through a spokesperson, acknowledged responsibility for the lot’s condition but estimated the cleanup and repairs—fencing, graffiti removal, and trash abatement—would cost an additional $10,000. “Thousands of dollars to restore a lot, abate the graffiti, abate the trash, and help the homeless,” Suarez said. “It costs thousands of dollars. Where are they supposed to put that kind of money?\" She also called for more flexibility and support from the city. “We need to find a common ground both in helping fund these kinds of cleanups and helping bring outreach to these private vacant lots as well,” Suarez added, “but give these owners a little bit more leeway.\" While fines may be delayed if a property owner shows progress, many struggle to meet city deadlines due to difficulties in securing contractors for fencing and security upgrades.

    "fullContent": "Jim Quinn Questions Tariff-Mania Authored by Jim Quinn via The Burning Platform, Tariffs are going to Make America Great Again!!!! Our deficit problems will be cured. The national debt will decline. Our fiscal nightmare is over. Right? Trump is so excited, he can’t sleep. He’s boasting about the billions in tariff revenues at midnight. He ain’t wrong. The chart below clearly shows the massive surge in tariff revenue generated by his policies since taking office. The total tariff revenues in the 6 months since he has taken office are $120 billion, versus the $50 billion taken in those same 6 months in the prior year. Based on current trends, Trump’s tariffs could bring in close to $400 billion on an annualized basis. Not too shabby compared to the $100 billion taken in the years prior to his new tariffs. Trump isn’t bashful about hyping what he believes are outstanding achievements, like quadrupling tariff revenues and forcing those foreign countries to “pay their fair share”. The numbers don’t lie, but a little perspective on the scale and ultimate impact of these tariffs may be helpful. The national debt is on course to increase by $1.9 trillion this fiscal year ending 9/30/25. It is up $700 billion since Trump took office. The Big Beautiful Bill didn’t cut one dime from the budget. The national debt will increase by about $2 trillion in the next fiscal year, and the one after that, and the one after that, and the one after that. You get the picture. Increased debt until economic collapse. The national debt will increase by approximately $5.5 billion per day forever, because the spending is on automatic pilot. Trump and your corrupt congress maggots have no intention of cutting any spending. A recession, war, or another fake pandemic would just drive the spending higher. So basically, the $300 billion in added tariff revenue will be frittered away by your government in less than 2 months. And if Trump goes through with his tariff rebate idea, the revenues will evaporate quicker, not that we should mind having the money in our pockets, rather than Nancy Pelosi’s and Chuck Schumer’s. I know the Trump cheerleaders and social media influencers have been ecstatic that the tariffs have not created the dreaded surge in inflation predicted by the Fed and other economic “experts”. As the chart clearly shows, the tariffs have only been in place for 4 months. Does anyone understand the inflation impact is going to lag the implementation period? Does anyone understand there are only two possibilities regarding these tariffs? – either the corporations buying the goods wholesale eat the increase and decrease their profits or they pass along the price increases to the customers. In the first case, corporate profits will decline and the stock market (at all-time highs and valuations) will likely decline significantly. In the more likely case, the corporations will pass the price increases to their customers, generating an increase in inflation and further robbing the average household of their spending power. Of course, Trump will instruct his new head of the BLS to fake the CPI number even more than it is already faked, to hide the real inflation caused by his tariffs. I think a personal anecdote I’ve experienced will show you the devious methods corporations will use to pass these tariffs along. I have been buying a pack of coated paper plates at Wal-Mart for years. The pack contained 70 paper plates. Within the last four months, the pack was reduced to 50 plates, for the same price. They know the average dolt, after years of government schooling, is deficient in math skills, so they would not realize they just experienced a 40% increase in price per plate. This will show up nowhere in the fake BLS numbers. Shrinkflation is just as bad as inflation, but they can hide it and pretend all is well, while maintaining their profits. Tariffs sounded great on the campaign trail. Foreign countries were clearly taking advantage of the U.S. through unfair trade practices. Trump’s threats and follow through on those threats have forced concessions from dozens of major trading partners. But his threatening rhetoric hasn’t worked on China, Brazil, India or the other BRIC countries, as they maneuver to replace the U.S. ruling economic empire. And now using tariffs/sanctions against Russia, China, and India to force Putin into an unacceptable peace plan with Ukraine/NATO is rhyming with FDR’s oil embargo on Japan in 1941. The unintended consequences of his actions are yet to be revealed, but ultimately these tariffs should be judged by their overall results, rather than the intentions and narratives surrounding them.

    "fullContent": "UBS Pushes Back China Property Recovery Timeline Amid Faltering Sales John Lam, head of China and Hong Kong property research at UBS, has pushed back his recovery timeline in China's battered real estate sector to the second half of 2026. The delay reflects fading sales momentum and growing stimulus fatigue from the People's Bank of China, raising doubts about near-term tailwinds for the world's second-largest economy. In March, Lam told clients that home prices across top-tier markets would \"turn stable\" by early 2026. That forecast has been pushed out to mid-to-late 2026 unless more stimulus measures are rolled out. \"The sales momentum has become tepid in recent months,\" Lam said in an interview, quoted by Bloomberg, adding, \"If that continues, a recovery will occur later than expected.\" Last month, Goldman analysts led by Andrew Tilton warned clients that China's housing market continues to accelerate to the downside (read the note). This raised questions about whether Beijing may revive its 2015 stimulus playbook (read the note). Related: China's Big Housing Stimulus Rescue Is Wishful Thinking Bloomberg noted, \"Lam is known for downgrading China Evergrande Group at the start of 2021, 11 months before the nation's most indebted developer defaulted during the housing meltdown,\" adding, \"He also took a bold stance last year by turning bullish on the sector, even as most of his peers were forecasting a further decline.\" Here are some of the key points from Lam about China's delayed property market recovery: Sales Slowdown: Home sales by the top 100 developers have declined over 20% for two consecutive months, while new-home prices fell .27% in June, marking the steepest drop in eight months. Inventory Rising: Inventory turnover in tier-one cities rose from 14 months in March to 20.7 months in June, signaling soft demand and delayed absorption. Stimulus Fatigue: Existing stimulus measures appear to be slowing. The Politburo recently declined to add more property-specific support despite mounting pressure. The bottom line is that China's property market downturn will persist through the second half of this year and into early next year. Signs of recovery may begin to emerge at some point in 2026, potentially creating upside scenarios in beaten-down property stocks. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 18:00",
