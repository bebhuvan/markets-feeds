    "fullContent": "Germany's Insolvency Tsunami: Structural Breakdown Underway By Thomas Kolbe Collapse of a Sham Economy Germany is being hit by a wave of insolvencies. Now in the third year of a prolonged recession, the economic situation is more alarming than during the 2009 financial crisis. The death spiral of German businesses has reached dramatic proportions. According to the Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Halle (IWH), the second quarter of 2025 saw the highest number of insolvencies among partnerships and corporations in 20 years. Despite a slight decline in June, the trend remains: Germany’s economic substance is eroding — and with it, the nation is quietly bidding farewell to its prosperity. Mass Extinction of German Companies In June alone, the IWH economists counted 1,420 corporate bankruptcies — down 4% from May. But year-on-year comparisons reveal the full scope of the crisis: a 23% increase from June 2024. The figures are also over 50% higher than the pre-lockdown average. Particularly noteworthy: In economically strong states like Bavaria and Hesse, insolvencies rose disproportionately by 80% and 79%, respectively. Altogether, 4,524 company insolvencies were recorded in Q2 — a 7% rise compared to Q1 2025. Economists cite not only the ongoing recession but also a long-overdue market correction following years of ultra-low interest rates from the European Central Bank. As Steffen Müller, head of insolvency research at IWH, puts it: “For many years, extremely low interest rates prevented bankruptcies, and during the pandemic, state aid kept alive firms that were already weak.” Now, the market is reclaiming its cleansing power. Avoidance of Root Cause Analysis But this structural rupture meets a vacuum in economic policy. While the IWH analysis avoids addressing the deeper structural weaknesses and self-inflicted political damage, these remain the decisive factors behind Germany’s economic isolation. High energy costs, overregulation, and tax burdens — by international standards — are driving companies either to bankruptcy or abroad. Workers are now increasingly feeling the effects. According to consulting firm Ernst & Young, over 100,000 jobs will likely be cut in 2025, especially in the industrial sector — the main victim of the energy and regulatory crisis. Since the pre-COVID period, German industry has lost roughly 10% of its production volume. Viewed in isolation, the sector resembles a depression more than a recession. A return to a sustainable growth path is unlikely under current conditions. The heavily hit construction sector also suffers. Once a stabilizing force in 2020–21, building activity has collapsed since 2022. Real construction output fell 4% in 2024, with another 2.5–3% decline expected for 2025. Overall, real construction volume in 2025 will be 10–12% below 2019 levels. False Hopes for a Rescue The German government plans a €847 billion debt-financed stimulus over four years, mainly for military upgrades and infrastructure. However, most of the funds will likely be diverted to plug holes in Germany’s hemorrhaging social security system. In 2025 alone, a social insurance deficit of at least €140 billion is expected. The federal government must fill this gap to avoid spiraling secondary costs. If so, the ambitious investment plans of the Merz administration will collapse. Germany has become a socioeconomic problem case — and its leaders are clinging to the outdated Keynesian playbook. State spending, financed through debt and backstopped by ECB rate suppression, is expected to jump-start the economy. But this will not happen. Only the market can efficiently allocate scarce capital toward productive uses that create prosperity. Berlin has yet to grasp this reality. The recent U.S.-EU trade deal will cost Germany roughly €6.5 billion in tariffs in the first year. But far more damaging will be the accelerating exodus of companies relocating operations to the U.S. to avoid tariffs — unless Germany’s tariff regime changes. The Merz government’s debt binge may briefly delay the insolvency wave by flooding markets with artificial capital. But this merely postpones the inevitable reckoning — a purge of subsidized zombie firms that thrived on cheap credit or EU Green Deal handouts. Big Government, Green Ideology Just weeks into Friedrich Merz’s chancellorship, one thing is clear: There will be no return to market-based economic policy. Merz has revealed himself as a proponent of big government, interventionism, and green transformation orthodoxy. Germany still holds the political weight to derail Brussels’ transformation agenda and force a return to economic rationality. But so far, the country’s rapid deindustrialization and prolonged recession have not triggered a critical reassessment of its political course.

    "fullContent": "Moldova Jails Popular Pro-Russian Governor, Outraging The Kremlin Just over two weeks ago Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) issued a statement accusing the West, under US leadership, of turning Moldova into a military outpost aimed at confronting Russia, akin to what has happened over several years with Ukraine. Moscow has also accused the West of long meddling in the Republic of Georgia with the same purpose in mind. The SVR's provocative statement, which came in mid-July said Washington wants to use the country as \"cannon fodder\" in future hostilities, which is allegedly being fast-tracked by Western foreign policy decision-makers. Now the tiny country with EU aspirations (having been granted candidate status in 2022) is front and center in regional headlines, after a main opposition figure was arrested for alleged Russian-ties related to corruption. Governor of the Russian-speaking Gagauzia autonomous region Evghenia Gutul, file image The Kremlin has accused Moldovan authorities of engaging in political persecution after a court sentenced the pro-Russian governor of Moldova’s autonomous Gagauzia region to seven years in prison on Tuesday. Gagauzia’s governor, Evghenia Gutul, is accused of channeling Russian funds to a banned political party. The government alleges that she transferred Russian money to the outlawed Shor Party between 2019 and 2022, paving the way for deeper 'Russian influence' in Gagauzia, a southern Moldovan region made up primarily of Russian-speaking ethnic Turks. Gutul, who has rejected the accusations, has appealed for international help - especially in messages to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. She had been under arrest since March 2025, but prior to that reportedly traveled to Moscow to gain the support of Kremlin officials. She has previously stated, \"A fabricated criminal case has been brought against me. The Anti-corruption Prosecutor's Office, under the influence of (Moldovan President Maia) Sandu, is targeting those who have improved lives in their country, worked for the benefit of the people, and opposed the government's destructive actions, rather than tackling corruption.\" Today, another court hearing took place in the fabricated criminal case against me — a case that has been political, not legal, from the very beginning. pic.twitter.com/FMtqeeOZ1M — Evghenia Gutul (@EvgheniaGutul) April 14, 2025 Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov blasted the ruling as \"clearly politically motivated\" as it represents \"open and arguably unlawful pressure on political opponents\" ahead of Moldova’s parliamentary elections this September. Peskov added, \"We are seeing the systematic suppression of opposition forces in Moldova, essentially stripping voters of the chance to choose freely. It’s clear that democratic standards and principles are being continuously undermined.\" Tensions are soaring, with pro-Gutul protesters taking to the streets, also after Moldovan President Maia Sandu's recent warning and allegation that Russia was preparing an \"unprecedented\" campaign to interfere in the small country's fall elections. The tiny Eastern European nation bordering Ukraine has experienced the same kind of internal political pro-EU vs. pro-Russia tug of war historically on display in other countries such as Ukraine or Georgia. One thing which has long alarmed the West is the presence of Russian 'peacekeeping' troops in Moldova's breakaway Transnistria region. As for Transnistria, although it has diverse ethnic demographics almost equally apportioned between Russians, Moldovans, Romanians and Ukrainians, the Russian demographic slightly ekes out its counterparts with a plurality of 29% of Transnistrians belonging to the group. NATO wants to bring Moldova directly into its orbit, and ultimately kick Russian troops out of the region. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 02:45",
