    "fullContent": "These Are The Most Turbulent Flight Routes On Each Continent The visual below, created by Julie Peasley via Visual Capitalist, maps the single most turbulent flight route on each continent using Turbli’s 2024 rankings. Turbli compiles daily turbulence along actual flight tracks and reports average intensity using the eddy dissipation rate (EDR) scale from 0 to 100 (light to extreme). South America’s Mendoza (MDZ)–Santiago (SCL) tops the chart at 24.684 average EDR, followed by mountain-hugging routes such as Kathmandu–Lhasa, Albuquerque–Denver, and Christchurch–Wellington. Interestingly, SCL has the distinction of being the world’s most turbulent airport. Europe’s Nice–Geneva and Africa’s Durban–Johannesburg also make the list. What the Data Shows Several of the bumpiest routes trace over or alongside major mountain chains—the Andes, Himalayas, Alps, and Southern Alps—where strong winds can generate mountain waves, rotors, and turbulent shear. Island-to-island or strait crossings (e.g., Wellington) also see rough air as winds accelerate through gaps. Why Turbulence Is Rising A growing body of research points to more frequent clear-air turbulence (CAT), driven by climate change. Warmer air intensifies wind shear in jet streams; over the North Atlantic, the annual duration of severe CAT increased about 55% between 1979 and 2020, with notable rises across other busy regions as well. EDR: The Standard for “How Bumpy” EDR is an objective, aircraft-independent measure of turbulence intensity and the ICAO/WMO standard used in aviation. NCAR and partners compute EDR from onboard parameters to create consistent, comparable reports, which is exactly the kind of metric Turbli aggregates for its rankings. What This Means for Flyers Rougher skies don’t mean flying is unsafe. Modern aircraft are designed for turbulence, and injuries are rare when seat belts are fastened.

    "fullContent": "Egypt Training Palestinian Forces To Govern Post-War Gaza Via Middle East Eye Egypt has been training Palestinian forces for months to take over the security administration of the Gaza Strip, as part of its plan for post-war reconstruction and governance of Gaza, security and diplomatic sources told Middle East Eye. An agreement to train Palestinian forces in Egypt and Jordan has been in place since the first Palestinian Police Donors Conference in Oslo in December 1993. In April, Egyptian and Palestinian media reported that 300 Palestinian Authority security personnel were sent to Cairo: 100 police officers, 100 national security officers, 50 preventive security officers and 50 intelligence officers, as part of the Egyptian reconstruction plan. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas (R) meets with Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, via AFP. “All of these trainees are affiliated with the Fatah movement and loyal to the PA under Mahmoud Abbas,” an Egyptian security source told MEE. “Cairo avoided including individuals loyal to Palestinian leader Mohammed Dahlan so as not to provoke objections from the PA leadership in Ramallah, and to ensure the idea receives Saudi support,” the source added. Another portion was trained in Jordan, but the numbers trained were not large, as both Cairo and Amman were hoping to obtain Gulf funding to continue the effort, the source said. The 1993 Oslo conference was convened at the invitation of 14 donor countries, in addition to the European Union, the United States, the World Bank, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel. Egypt and Jordan were the only two Arab countries to attend the conference, and a memorandum of understanding was signed to train thousands of Palestinian police officers, before the actual deployment of Palestinian police to Gaza and Jericho began in 1994. The number or batches of forces receiving this training were not announced. Since the 1993 agreement, several of the PA’s forces have been sent to Cairo to attend security and military training courses at the Police Academy, the Military Academy and the Higher Military and Strategic Studies Academy (formerly the Nasser Higher Military Academy), which is a military academy in Egypt specialising in advanced military studies. Reconstruction plan Since the beginning of the Israeli assault on Gaza in October 2023, Egypt has been training young people from Gaza or who hail from the enclave, some residing and educated in Egypt, others who fled to Cairo after the war began, and others residing in the West Bank whose families originally come from the Gaza Strip, to carry out security administration, take on police duties and later govern the Gaza Strip, diplomatic and security sources told MEE. This is part of the reconstruction plan proposed by Egypt during the Arab Summit in March. The plan aims to restore PA governance by working with Jordan to train Palestinian police for deployment in the strip, supported by political, financial and international backing, potentially involving other countries in rehabilitation efforts. The plan also proposes that the UN Security Council consider deploying international protection or peacekeeping forces in both Gaza and the West Bank, within a broader framework and timetable for establishing a Palestinian state and building its institutional capacity. A key challenge, according to the plan, would be the presence of multiple Palestinian armed groups, which the plan argues can only be resolved through a credible political process that addresses the root causes and restores rights to Palestinians. The plan, however, has not received any approval or Gulf, particularly Saudi, support, an Egyptian diplomatic source told MEE. Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi had attempted to persuade Gulf states of the Egyptian reconstruction plan in a closed meeting held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, prior to the Arab Summit, the source said. The plan, which Egypt proposed for what is known as “the day after the war ends”, was presented as an alternative to US President Donald Trump’s plan to displace Gaza’s residents to establish the “Gaza Riviera” resort. However, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates refused to provide any support or funding for the Egyptian plan, or for any alternative plan, before the war ends, conditioning such support on the disarmament of Hamas and the removal of its fighters from the Gaza Strip before engaging in any reconstruction process or transferring funds to Cairo, the diplomatic source added. Aly el-Raggal, a security analyst and researcher at the University of Florence in Italy, said that this plan serves many Egyptian interests, particularly Egypt’s security penetration into the Gaza Strip, something Cairo sees as a necessity. “The deeper its security presence inside Gaza, the greater its political and social influence, and the greater its regional role,” he told MEE. “This is a necessary course of action at present, especially in light of the significant curtailment of Egypt’s role in all regional files.” 'A vision for security' However, Rajjal added, this security plan proposed by Egypt is impossible to implement under the current circumstances and with the presence of armed factions inside the strip. “The condition for this plan to materialize is the end of the war and the end of Hamas and the rest of the resistance factions as well. This is not possible according to the current realities inside the Strip, especially in light of the decision by the Israeli Security Cabinet to occupy the Gaza Strip.” Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdel Aaty had referred to the forces Cairo is training to govern the strip during the two-state solution conference held in New York last month. Egypt has continued keeping its border with Gaza closed with massive razor wire & several layers of tall fencing...

According to Egyptian security sources, Cairo had initially resisted linking disarmament to ceasefire negotiations. However, under sustained pressure from the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Egypt shifted its stance, aligning itself with regional efforts to initiate what has been described as a “surrender process”, the sources told MEE last week. This position aligns with Israeli preconditions, backed by Washington, for ending the war on Gaza. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 03:30",
