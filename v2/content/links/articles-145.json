    "fullContent": "Going, Going, Gone... Authored by James Howard Kunstler, “Because they can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality, they are too crazy to lead this country, and Americans know it.” - Sasha Stone on the Democratic Party In case you’re wondering why the Democratic Party is in a death spiral, it is the proportionate response to the damage they have done to American culture and politics. You might think that they fell haplessly into error, but their turn to Marxian idealism was a cover for a matrix of hustles and rackets to make up for a void of any sane political program. Coming into the 21st century, our country was beset by looming decline. Our industrial base was going, going, gone, and with it millions of well-paying blue-collar jobs, the Democratic Party base. It was replaced by a so-called “financialized economy,” which was sanitized language for sets of swindles and frauds allowed to operate in the de-regulated banking system, in concert with the politicized Federal Reserve and crooked Congressional interests — you notice how many politicians paid $175-K a year somehow acquired multi-million-dollar fortunes? What mainly grew in this period was government and things that fed off of it, such as the war industries, computer tech allied with the Intel gang, and especially the burgeoning universe of government-sponsored non-profit advocacy orgs, which became the jobs program for otherwise unemployables churned out of higher education, a racket that fed on federal loan guarantees. It was in the racketeering ecosystem that billionaires such as George Soros and Bill Gates could use their fortunes to advance their own personal obsessions through webs of non-governmental orgs (NGOs) to influence public affairs. By 2016, that was really all that the Democratic Party had left. It was the source of their money and their power. They also had the accumulated political capital of race advocacy, starting with the civil rights crusades of the 1960s. After our victory over manifest evil in World War Two, the Jim Crow system had to go, or else America could not pretend to lead the so-called “free world.” By some paradoxical alchemy of government policy and human nature, the civil rights campaign eventually produced a larger and more intractable “underclass” than existed before. This baffled liberal idealists who had expected a new era of brotherhood and equality. They could only account for it by “structural racism,” and the Marxian trope of “oppressors-and-victims” fit into that scaffold perfectly. It lured them into Marxian “praxis” generally, which by then was already failing everywhere else in the world it had been tried as “communism.” One way to counter “structural racism” was to declare a new ethos of “multiculturalism,” meaning each ethnic or racial group could behave according to its own particular standards and values. It was like waving a magic wand to make failure disappear and it worked through the 1990s, (which happened to be the fattest years of cheap oil production in America). The trouble with multiculturalism was that it negated the thing that had held America together through vicissitudes such as the Great Depression and World War Two: The American common culture, the thing that belonged to everyone. The MAGA movement has largely been an effort to reconstruct an American common culture, a consensus of values and behaviors we can all agree on. The Democratic Party opted to oppose that — a poor choice. In fact, they apparently viewed that effort as an existential threat to the hustles and rackets that were sustaining the party. For instance, the jobs program for otherwise unemployable college grads who styled themselves as “activists” working for NGOs under the umbrella of USAID. This was the party’s army of influencers, organizers, ward-heelers, and ballot-harvesters, laboring on behalf of the “victims of oppression.” Quite a few of them resided in Academia, where they cultivated a whole lexicon of arcane, gnostic, crypto-Marxian ideology aimed not just at opposing the recovery of a common culture, but destroying whatever remnants of it remained. The catch was: they didn’t believe in “social justice” or “diversity, equity, and inclusion.” That was just a smokescreen of verbiage over their race hustle, which means extorting money, unearned advantages, and status dishonestly. Thus was DEI birthed. And, with it, colossal frauds of “victimhood” such as the beatification of George Floyd and a long line of similar “justice-involved” cases that generated an impressive revenue flow for the Democrats. That revenue flow and its utility for holding power was all they had left in 2024. It explains the empty symbolism of running Kamala Harris for president. Now, the money flow is gone and so is the party’s power and perhaps its last remaining reason for existence: the maintenance of its own power. Notice that the Democrats can’t even advocate for the return of USAID, now that it has been unmasked as rife with financial fraud and crime. There is surely a need for an opposition party to any in-party, which happens to be Mr. Trump’s Republicans at the moment, if only because power corrupts. You can see the outline of what that new opposition party might be: a party of re-localization, of small business and small farmers, of traditional towns as opposed to still-rampant and malignant suburban sprawl. Some related issues already belong to MAGA, such as smaller government, the protection of privacy, respect for the Bill of Rights — but these would be implicit in the restoration of an American common culture, a set of values and standards of behavior that both parties in a two-party system can subscribe to.

    "fullContent": "Israel said it will take control of Gaza City — a move that could displace 1 million Palestinians living there — defying domestic concerns over the fate of the remaining hostages and an international outcry over the humanitarian situation in the enclave. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet approved the operation early Friday for the purpose of “defeating Hamas” after 22 months of fighting that’s killed tens of thousands of Gazans and sparked UN famine warnings. The decision stopped short of the full takeover that Netanyahu floated in an interview with Fox News on Thursday. Jonathan Panikoff, Director, Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative and Senior Fellow, GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council, discusses the impact of this latest news to the region's stability.

    "fullContent": "Putin Tells Trump He'll Halt War In Exchange For Eastern Ukraine Update (1630ET): Russian President Putin has detailed his demands for a cease-fire in Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal reports that the sweeping proposal demands major territorial concessions by Kiev and a push for global recognition of its claims in exchange for a halt to the fighting. Putin told Witkoff he would agree to a complete cease-fire if Ukraine agreed to withdraw forces from all of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, according to officials briefed on the call. Russia would then control Donetsk, Luhansk, as well as the Crimea peninsula, which it seized in 2014 and wants recognized as sovereign Russian territory. Russia now occupies most of Donetsk and Luhansk, but Ukrainian forces still control sizable chunks of territory, including key cities that are now strongholds of its defense. European officials expressed serious reservations about the proposal * * * As we detailed earlier, Bloomberg is reporting, according to people familiar with the matter, that Washington and Moscow are aiming to reach a deal to halt the war in Ukraine that would lock in Russia’s occupation of territory seized during its military invasion. US and Russian officials are working toward an agreement on territories for a planned summit meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin as early as next week, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. The US is working to get buy-in from Ukraine and its European allies on the deal, which is far from certain, the people said. Putin is demanding that Ukraine cede its entire eastern Donbas area to Russia as well as Crimea, which his forces illegally annexed in 2014. That would require Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to order a withdrawal of troops from parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions still held by Kyiv, handing Russia a victory that its army couldn’t achieve militarily since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Such an outcome would represent a major win for Putin, who has long sought direct negotiations with the US on terms for ending the war that he started, sidelining Ukraine and its European allies. What are the odds Zelensky goes for this deal... and will Europe back it? Zelenskiy risks being presented with a take-it-or-leave-it deal to accept the loss of Ukrainian territory, while Europe fears it would be left to monitor a ceasefire as Putin rebuilds his forces. Russia would halt its offensive in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine along the current battlelines as part of the deal, the people said. They cautioned that the terms and plans of the accord were still in flux and could still change. Oil prices immediately tumbled on the report... The White House didn’t reply to a request to comment. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn’t immediately respond to a request to comment. Ukraine declined to comment on the proposals. It’s still unclear if Putin would agree to take part in a trilateral meeting with Trump and Zelenskiy next week, even if he had already struck an agreement with the US president, the people added. The Russian leader told reporters on Thursday that he didn’t object to meeting Zelenskiy under the right conditions, though he said they don’t exist now. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 16:15",

    "fullContent": "Hamas Warns Israel It Is 'Sacrificing' Captives With Plans To Occupy Gaza City Hamas has warned Israel that it is 'sacrificing' hostages with its newly approved plans to takeover and occupy Gaza City, and the whole of the strip. The militant jihadist group called Netanyahu's plans a \"war crime\" and highlighted that Israel's careful use of the term \"control\" instead of \"occupation\" an attempt to whitewash the truth, and \"to evade its legal responsibility for the consequences of its brutal crime against civilians.\" Hamas itself has killed thousands of Israelis - with most killed during its Oct.7 2023 terror attack on southern Israel - when it took hundreds captive. But it's believed maybe just a dozen or more hostages are still alive - according to recent statements of Israeli officials. Hamas recently featured a propaganda video of a still living hostage 'digging his own grave' in the tunnels under the Gaza Strip. \"They realize that expanding the aggression means sacrificing them,\" the new Hamas statement said. This isn't the first time that Hamas has warned more hostages could die as a result of Israeli actions. Amid conflicting reports, the militant group has in the past claimed that Israel's own air and artillery strikes have killed and wounded some of the hostages. In a new vile propaganda video, the Hamas terrorist organization forced the emaciated hostage, Evyatar David, to dig his own grave. pic.twitter.com/BVNsHpqeCE — Israel War Room (@IsraelWarRoom) August 2, 2025 Interestingly, Netanyahu is still touting that he's open to Doba-based peace negotiations. \"We reiterate that, during our communication with the Egyptian and Qatari mediators, the movement offered all the necessary flexibility and positivity to ensure the success of the ceasefire efforts,\" the PM's office said. Local as well as international reports say the scale of the new military offensive will require many thousands more reservists: In a meeting of the security cabinet that lasted 10 hours, ministers approved proposals for the \"takeover of Gaza City\", which is likely to be the first phase for the Israeli military to assume full control of Gaza, as Netanyahu says it is his intention. A statement released by his office did not use the word \"occupation\" but, effectively, that is what the plans mean. It is not clear when the operations, which could take months, will start, as the military will have to call up thousands of reservists, exhausted after serving multiple times, and allow for the forced evacuation of residents from an area where around 800,000 Palestinians live. Israel in its conquest and 'control' efforts will be overseeing a largely starving Palestinian population, with most of them having long been internally displaced. NBC is reporting that privately Trump 'yelled' at Bibi over the aid situation and rising humanitarian crisis - but the Israeli prime minister's office is denying it... ⚡️Trump 'yelled' at Netanyahu during a recent phone call when he told him there was no mass hunger in the Gaza Strip — NBC Sources report that when Netanyahu tried to convince Trump that the mass hunger in Gaza was not true and that the information was fabricated by Hamas, Trump… pic.twitter.com/utbAG2D7a7 — MenchOsint (@MenchOsint) August 8, 2025 Germany has reacted by halting all arms exports which could be used offensively in Gaza, and even UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in a rare break from Tel Aviv called the plan \"wrong\" and urged Israel to reconsider it \"immediately\". China too is airing its extreme concern, but all of this global pressure is unlikely to deter Netanyahu after well over 600 days at war. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 15:45",

    "fullContent": "WTF! Trend Of Adults Using Pacifiers To 'Relieve Stress' Is Snowballing Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, There is an increasingly popular trend of grown adults using pacifiers, or binkies to ‘relieve stress’. Yes, really. Men and women are literally regressing to a pre-toddler state of mind when the world becomes too much for them, the New York Post reports. Despite the devices being bad for jaws and teeth and being dangerous to sleep with, people are acting like babies and sucking on pacifiers because they can’t handle the real world. Stressed adults rely on pacifiers to soothe themselves: ‘I feel a sense of safety from childhood’ https://t.co/S26kAQuDh5 pic.twitter.com/3uGWI7H649 — New York Post (@nypost) August 7, 2025 The report states: TikTok is sucking it up — literally — with videos of American adults pacifying themselves in traffic, at work, or in the throes of burnout. In the comments section of a TikTok by @thebentist, one user swore, “I just use an adult pacifier it hasn’t moved my teeth been using them for 4 years.” Another doubled down: “Just get an adult pacifier I use one! And the ADHD tip it works!!(for me).” Others admitted, “we gotta do what we gotta do to keep focused. over bite or not getting stuff we need to get done. Lol,” while one confessed, “im so ashamed, I’ve been addicted for 23 years, my entire life.” A cursory search on the web reveals a whole sub culture of people making YouTube videos about adult pacifiers, reviewing and unboxing them. The people appearing on camera are often dressed in adult sized baby clothes, surround themselves with baby toys, and have multicoloured hair. They’re clearly just mentally unstable and need help. Something has gone very very wrong in the childhood of these individuals. I saw one of these recently in on a college campus in North Carolina. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Adults with pacifiers is a mental illness. — Matt Van Swol (@matt_vanswol) August 7, 2025 Please @nypost, Please conduct a poll of the adults with pacifiers and ask what political party they all vote for. We all know the answer, but just to prove a point, please do it. PLEASE!!! https://t.co/OVHoaCdpk2 — Common Sense Todd (@CommonSenseTodd) August 7, 2025 If you need a pacifier as an adult, you shouldn’t be allowed to vote. https://t.co/wJJLIi8h52 — Amy Curtis (@RantyAmyCurtis) August 7, 2025 When I was younger, people who were using meth and other drugs would use pacifiers to soothe them until they get their next ‘fix’. Now it’s progressed from drug addicts to mental illness. — Savannah (@BasedSavannah) August 7, 2025 No, stressed adults do NOT rely on pacifiers to soothe themselves. Mentally stunted, attention-seeking morons rely on pacifiers to soothe themselves. https://t.co/TUdLlcs9aM — 𝓐𝓵𝓵𝓮𝓷 𝓡𝓪𝔂 (@2CynicAl65) August 7, 2025 send the asteroid — Bullish Chart (@bullishchart) August 7, 2025 The infantilisation of popular culture has only snowballed in the past six years since we made this video: * * * Your support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

While it’s not wrong, that argument misses the true role of childcare: social infrastructure that keeps families connected. Volunteer counselor Ann McNamee reads a book with a child who attends Project Camp, which provided free childcare to families impacted by wildfires, at Eagle Rock Recreation Center on January 15, 2025, in Los Angeles, California. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) This piece is adapted from Raising a Nation: 10 Reasons Every American Has a Stake in Child Care For All by Elliot Haspel (Oxford University Press, released August 11, 2025). If there’s one thing Democratic and Republican politicians can agree on, it’s that childcare is the workforce behind the workforce. “Our child care workers are the workforce behind the workforce, risking their health and safety on the front lines to ensure that parents can go to work,” then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in 2020. Republican representative Ashley Hinson echoed Pelosi in 2024, asserting that childcare staff “are the workforce behind the workforce, and I don’t want to see parents having to make that choice between working or staying home because of the availability” of slots. Yes, childcare helps the economy hum. But childcare does so much more than just keep parents participating in the labor force. It is an essential piece of social infrastructure. As social cohesion declines, so too does the American quality of life — and this trend hits parents hard, with two-thirds of parents reporting feeling socially disconnected. Childcare centers are one of the few supports available to connect parents of young children to each other and their broader communities, easing the burden of isolation. The “workforce behind the workforce” line misses that richness and sets the childcare system on the path to corporatization. According to former US surgeon general Vivek Murthy, the country is going through an epidemic of loneliness, and parents in particular are struggling. Their “disproportionately high levels of loneliness,” Murthy has said, “compound the day-to-day challenges they face.” When people become isolated and disconnected, community bonds fray and it becomes much harder to forge the solidaristic movements needed to improve conditions for all. Childcare programs stand out as a potential beacon amid this dark forecast. Sociologist Mario Luis Small studied childcare centers in New York City and found that they “tend to be a remarkably effective broker for the mothers whose children they service. They broker both social and organizational ties, and their brokerage is associated with greater material and mental well-being.” In his analysis, Small found that among mothers who utilized centers, “about 60% made at least one friend, and more than 40% made three or more friends in centers.” Childcare educators frequently function as a source of stability that keeps families from spiraling into crisis. They can offer emotional attunement and practical help, like connecting parents to food programs, keeping children’s routines steady during family upheaval, or stepping in with extra guidance when a child struggles emotionally or academically. In the childcare documentary Make a Circle, preschool educator Dan recalls how important his childcare providers were as he grew up with a single mother and struggled with learning disabilities. “My mom was both my parents, and my other parent was my preschool teachers,” Dan says, voice thick with emotion. “They helped my mom when she needed assistance. They helped me. They helped my family. They, in essence, I feel, saved my life.” Childcare also helps keep families rooted in their communities rather than having to move away in search of viable care options, which can be scarce in both rural and urban areas. As Qweyonoh Parker, a public-school teacher and mother of three in the Minneapolis region, wrote in a 2024 letter to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, “I can either sideline my career to care for my three children or go into debt to pay for child care. . . . I am seriously considering moving to Illinois, where I have family, not because I want to, but because I cannot see a path that allows me to work and raise my children in Minnesota.” Childcare programs can even be key players in disaster relief efforts. A 2023 report from the US Early Years Climate Action Task Force recounts the story of one such provider: Susan Gilmore runs North Bay Children’s Center, a California child care network with 13 locations. Her network contended with wildfires and their effects. She and her staff tracked children and families: who was evacuated, who lost their homes, and who needed resources. They set up a command center and created a spreadsheet to track every family—a difficult feat since many of the families they serve don’t own their home, or had evacuated, or were staying with relatives. Many families lacked power and food. Staff linked them to food banks and, when it was safe, brought resources to them. Seeing all of the different ways childcare programs contribute to healthy families and communities makes it all the more concerning that the system is under so much strain, facing widespread closures and high staff turnover while profit-seeking investors like private equity firms circle overhead. Many politicians and advocates have responded to this strain by doubling down on the economic case, defending childcare programs on the basis that they ensure companies have workers and workers have paychecks. Yet perhaps counterintuitively, overemphasizing the economic benefits of childcare can get in the way of the larger mindset shift needed to reposition care in American thought and policy. Valuing childcare slots primarily for their function in attaching parents to the labor force can breed indifference to how those slots are supplied. For instance, big investor-backed companies like KinderCare and Bright Horizons are regularly welcomed by Democratic politicians despite the fact that their business models inherently rely on a market-based, commodified view of care — and the fact that they have actively worked against goals of universal childcare. These chains are clear in their financial filings that they benefit from the existing market system with sliding-scale government subsidies and few guardrails on profit-seeking (a design present in the dominant Democratic childcare bill, the Child Care for Working Families Act) while being threatened by any governmental guarantee for free or low-cost care. If the argument is simply that the economy needs more available childcare slots, regardless of the particular characteristics of providers, then KinderCare and Bright Horizons are unobjectionable. There is an inherent tension in speaking of childcare as a public good deserving of large outlays from the public purse while reducing it to an instrumental enabler of work. If its only utility is to help people participate in the workforce, then people might be expected to secure it themselves, the same way people buy cars to get to their jobs. As sociologist and Canadian childcare advocate Susan Prentice has written, “Economic reframing displaces the justice-based rationale for child care. . . . The business case for child care builds an ideological/conceptual bridge to contemporary wealth production, not to social transformation.” This may also be why the fastest-growing part of the childcare sector is large for-profit chains backed by institutional investors, or why policymakers are increasingly turning to voluntary employer-provided benefits as a would-be solution. If the guiding principle of childcare is merely to help parents work, then there is little value in cultivating excellent programs with well-compensated, trained, reliable educators; little value in foregrounding community-based programs with deep attachments to the neighborhoods they serve. Proponents of corporate childcare provision often argue that there is value in standardized brand-name trust, and that economies of scale help chains maintain supply in a financially difficult sector. Yet as the writer Noelle Bodick has written, “Altogether, corporate day care reverses the natural order of human allegiances: you can’t trust in fickle individuals, but you can trust in LLCs, vast systems, corporate oversight and the cameras.” While chain sites can be high-quality and at times do integrate themselves into the community, many aren’t and don’t. Either way, it’s difficult to square a form of care that was in its early days compared to fast-food chains with what a truly abundant and community-driven childcare system should look like. This is a moment to step back and alter course. There is no reason to continue pushing the same workforce-behind-the-workforce messaging or embracing overly means-tested, technocratic policies that have little resonance with the public and frequently exclude relative caregivers and stay-at-home parents. It’s notable that not only did New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani win his primary with an agenda that includes universal, tax-funded, free-at-the-point-of-service childcare, but that other candidates were falling over themselves to offer big, bold childcare plans. Mamdani’s stated rationale has less to do with the city economy and more with allowing families with children to stay in the city they love. To be clear: the economic and workforce arguments for childcare are valid and have their place. But they need to be nested properly within a values-laden, family- and community-centered vision. We won’t get the childcare system American families need and deserve until we loudly make the case that childcare is as much a part of a community’s social infrastructure as schools, libraries, and parks, and equally deserving of public support for the same reasons. The good news is that when you let the full benefits of childcare come into focus, it’s a rather easy case to make.",
