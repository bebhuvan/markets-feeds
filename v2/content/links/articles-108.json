    "fullContent": "Trump To Nominate Long-Time Labor Statistics Critic As Head Of BLS Just over a week after Trump's shocking termination of BLS head, Erika McEntarfer (a 2023 Biden appointee), following a weak jobs report which saw the biggest negative revision outside of covid and prompted Trump to allege that the agency’s economic data was “rigged\", the president announced on Monday that he plans to nominate E.J. Antoni, the chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The position requires Senate confirmation. Antoni, a longtime critic of the agency’s handling of jobs data and fervent booster of ZeroHedge and our data on X, had the support of conservatives like former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. “Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” Trump posted Monday to Truth Social. “I know E.J. Antoni will do an incredible job in this new role.” Antoni’s nomination is the latest indication that the president wants to see a major makeover to the agency. As a quick look at @RealEJAnthony X account shows, he has been almost as critical of BLS data manipulation as ZeroHedge, which is why we shudder to think what the next jobs report will look like if the new BLS commissioner decides to kitchen sink all the accumulated BS. One thing is for certain: a negative 10 million jobs report will certainly accelerate Fed rate cuts, and send both gold and crypto to the moon, more or less literally. While the BLS is an independent agency under the Labor Department which is responsible for measuring and analyzing data on jobs, wages, and the economy, including the monthly jobs report, and helps paint a picture of America’s overall economic health, its data has come in under stark attack in recent years due to massive (mostly downward) revisions in recent years, most notably the near record 818K negative revision in August of 2024, which prompted the September 50bps rate cut by the Fed, viewed by many as a political (if ultimately futile) intervention by the central bank to boost Kamala Harris' chances of election. The BLS came under fire after Trump and some of his allies accused it of politicizing revisions to recent jobs reports. And while everyone knows that the BLS is in charge of the jobs numbers, fewer are aware that the BLS also cooks the inflation books, so to speak, and is the agency responsible for the CPI report... such as the one that drops at 8:30am tomorrow and will shape monetary policy well into 2026. Finally, if Trump indeed intends to politicize the BLS, expect an epic miss in tomorrow's CPI report. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 22:10",

    "fullContent": "Know-Your-Customer: Crypto's Quiet Kill-Switch Authored by 'Ghost Ghost' via BitcoinMagazine.com, The know-your-customer (KYC) threat isn’t coming. It’s already here, and it didn’t arrive through a nationwide ban or an emergency executive order. It quietly showed up with a checkbox and a Terms of Service agreement. While the influencers make noise about CBDCs and paper bitcoin, the real control system has already been deployed: Know Your Customer. Not dramatic. Not dystopian. Just regulated, normalized and accepted. But compliance isn’t neutral. It’s the infrastructure of financial control, and if you’re still handing over your ID to stack sats, you’re not buying freedom. You’re financing your own cage. The Real Attack Vector from KYC KYC regulations are marketed as a hedge against money laundering and fraud. The framing is safety. The reality is traceability. The moment you attach your identity to Bitcoin through an exchange signup — a utility bill attached, a passport uploaded — you forfeit the very autonomy that Bitcoin was designed to preserve. It’s not about what you’re doing. It’s about who you are. Once that link is made, every transaction becomes searchable, timestamped and admissible. This isn’t a theory. It’s how the system is already working. Canada froze bank accounts based on political donations. The U.K. arrests protestors using facial recognition. The U.S. executes geofence warrants without individual suspicion. Add KYC to that apparatus, and you’ve built a turnkey surveillance machine. No subpoenas. No charges. Just silent blacklists and frozen withdrawals. Didn’t you find it odd that they arrested the developers of mixers like Whirlpool and Tornado Cash, instead of the criminals that used them? KYC is Centralization by Design Governments didn’t need to outlaw Bitcoin; they just needed to know who’s using it. The combination of centralized exchanges, KYC records and behavioral analytics turns every bitcoin purchase into a breadcrumb trail. Every withdrawal from Coinbase or Kraken becomes part of a profile logged, indexed, stored. When regulators talk about “compliance,” this is what they mean: usable data pipelines. Sanitized, labeled UTXOs. A fully mapped ecosystem of wallets tied to real names and IP addresses. What they’re building isn’t about stopping crime. It’s about preemptively labeling dissent. You Are the Honeypot The most dangerous part of KYC is that it doesn’t look dangerous. There’s no siren, no red alert. Just a few forms, a phone verification — maybe a bonus if you sign up today. But each form you complete feeds the machine. Not just for you, but for everyone you interact with. KYC isn’t just surveillance. It’s contagious. A single identity-linked wallet poisons the privacy of every address it touches. Chain analysis firms don’t need to know everyone, they just need to know someone. Once that anchor point is set, mapping becomes mathematics. You’re not stacking sats. You’re stacking evidence. Exit Is a Deadline This is the accumulation phase. The calm before the enforcement. We’re in the same pre-crackdown posture we saw before the war on cash. The pattern is familiar: Normalize surveillance Demonize privacy Criminalize autonomy The result? Most users walked themselves into a trap. Not under threat, but under convenience. The “just in case” crowd, the ones who signed up, KYC’d and hoped it wouldn’t matter, are already compromised. Not because they did something wrong, but because they let someone else decide what’s wrong. And once that line moves? They’re already inside it. “But they can’t stop me from moving my bitcoin and transacting P2P.” No one wants blacklisted coins: They’ll be radioactive and useless. What Real Privacy Requires There’s no affiliate link for real privacy. No app store solution. No 10% discount for using your ID. It looks like discipline. Friction. Small decisions that don’t scale. Buying peer-to-peer instead of custodial Mining to clean wallets Using tools that don’t log your metadata Walking away from platforms that promise speed in exchange for obedience. It’s not glamorous. But it’s the difference between ownership and permission. Final Thought Bitcoin was never supposed to be polite. It was a way out. But as we normalize compliance in exchange for access, we risk turning that exit ramp into a regulated channel. KYC is not a bureaucratic detail. It’s the quiet kill switch for sovereignty. It doesn’t matter how many sats you stack if every one of them is logged, tagged and ready for blacklist. So ask yourself: What does it mean to own something? If the answer starts with a government ID, you’re already losing. No name. No compromise. No delay. Build the exit while you still can. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 21:45",

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation staged a five-hour raid on the home of Mark Luongo after an anonymous complaint was lodged against the P'nuts Freedom Farm, where internet sensation Peanut the squirrel was taken into custody along with his sidekick, Fred the raccoon - before the state euthanized both animals 'in order to test for rabies.' DEC officials claimed that P'Nut but an agent through thick leather gloves during the raid, necessitating both the squirrel and raccoon be decapitated and tested for rabies. The state later admitted that both tests were negative, and have never apologized nor returned the bodies of the pets. According to court documents, P'Nut and Fred's execution were \"not due to a fear of rabies,\" but a \"senseless act of violence\" and \"obscene demonstration of government abuse.\" This lawsuit comes on top of a previous suit filed by Longo and Bittner on June 27 in Chemung County Supreme Court against the City of Elmira and 36 individuals from various levels of state and local office - and seeks unspecified damages via jury trial. The couple claims they've suffered emotional trauma and financial losses since losing their star squirrel - who had appeared all over social media (including OnlyFans !?), according to both lawsuits. NEW: The owner of Peanut the squirrel explains how New York officials raided his house, took Peanut and his raccoon, and k*lled them. 7-year-old Peanut and Fred the raccoon were euthanized after anonymous complaints. “Officers raided my house as if I was a drug dealer. I was… pic.twitter.com/sSlbandoYO — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) November 2, 2024 \"RIP MY BEST FRIEND. Thank you for the best 7 years of my life. Thank you for bringing so much joy to us and the world. I’m sorry I failed you but thank you for everything,\" Longo wrote in a post announcing Peanut's death. A Connecticut native, Longo moved to Elmira, NY in 2023 to start the Freedom Farm, a 501.C.3 approved nonprofit. \"Last year we moved to NY in hopes of starting a NONPROFIT animal rescue in PNUT’s Name. [P’Nuts Freedom Farm] will forever live in PNUT’s memory,\" Longo wrote in a post announcing the seizure late last year. \"With over 350 rescues, we’ve relied heavily on PNUT and his internet family to father donations to help more animals. I don’t even know how will [sic] continue to fundraise for this nonprofit.\" The organization is made up of veterinarians and caregivers who rescue animals from abusive or dire situations.

    "fullContent": "IRS Announces No Changes To Withholding Tables, Information Return Forms For 2025 Authored by Naveen Athrappully via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), There will be no changes to individual information returns or withholding tables for the 2025 tax year while the IRS implements the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) in a phased manner, the agency said in an Aug. 7 statement. The IRS building in Washington on July 21, 2025. Madalina Kilroy/The Epoch Times Information returns are documents that businesses must file with the IRS, reporting transactions such as wages paid to employees. The IRS’s withholding tables describe how much an employer must withhold from an employee’s paycheck for taxes, Social Security, and Medicare. The OBBB was signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 and included certain provisions related to taxes. The IRS clarified that information return forms such as forms W-2, 1099, and 941 “will remain unchanged” for tax year 2025. The federal income tax withholding tables will not be updated with OBBB provisions, the agency said. “These decisions are intended to avoid disruptions during the tax filing season and to give the IRS, business, and tax professionals enough time to implement the changes effectively,” the agency said. The IRS asked employers and payroll providers to continue using existing procedures when it comes to reporting and withholding taxes. As for tax year 2026, the IRS said it was working to update forms and develop new guidance. The new changes will include how overtime pay and tips are reported. The IRS said it plans to coordinate with payroll providers, tax professionals, and employers to ensure a smooth transition to the new rules. Although there is no change in information returns or withholding tables, the OBBB has multiple provisions providing tax relief for Americans effective this year. For one, the OBBB eliminates taxes on tips, according to a July 14 statement from the IRS. Employees and self-employed individuals can deduct tips from their tax returns, provided their occupations are listed by the IRS as customarily receiving tips. The IRS must publish a list of these occupations by Oct. 2. The maximum annual deduction allowed in this case is $25,000, which phases out for taxpayers whose modified adjusted gross income is more than $150,000. Secondly, the OBBB eliminates taxes on overtime. “Individuals who receive qualified overtime compensation may deduct the pay that exceeds their regular rate of pay,” the IRS said. The maximum overtime deduction for a taxpayer is $12,500 per annum, which is phased out as income rises. To claim the deduction, taxpayers are required to include their Social Security numbers on their tax returns. Married individuals must file jointly to claim the deduction. For joint filers, it goes up to $25,000. Third, the car loan interest tax has been canceled by the OBBB. “Individuals may deduct interest paid on a loan used to purchase a qualified vehicle, provided the vehicle is purchased for personal use and meets other eligibility criteria,” the IRS said, adding that lease payments do not qualify for this benefit. To be considered a qualified deduction, the interest must be on a loan that originated after Dec. 31, 2024. The vehicle must have undergone final assembly in the United States. Fourth, Americans aged 65 and older can claim a tax deduction of $6,000, which is in addition to the existing standard deduction for this demographic. The deduction phases out for seniors with a modified adjusted gross income of more than $75,000. These four tax relief provisions are effective from 2025 through 2028. Rising Tax Collections, New Commissioner For fiscal year 2024, which ran from Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2024, the IRS collected more than $5.1 trillion in revenues, a roughly 9 percent increase from the previous fiscal year. This was the first time that the agency’s collections crossed the $5 trillion mark. “The IRS processed more than 266 million returns and other forms from individuals, businesses, and tax-exempt organizations; received almost 4.6 billion information returns; and issued close to $553 billion in refunds to individual and business taxpayers during FY 2024,” the agency said. The IRS is slated to get a new chief after Trump replaced commissioner Billy Long, a White House official told The Epoch Times. Long was confirmed to the post less than two months ago. Long said he will now act as U.S. ambassador to Iceland. “It is [an] honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland,” Long said in an Aug. 8 post on social media platform X. “I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as acting commissioner of the IRS. Andrew Moran contributed to this report. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 20:55",

    "fullContent": "Security Expert Reveals Hacker Could Remote Control Cars Through Major Automaker's 'Dealership Portal' In a shocking cyber security incident that should terrify every American, a top security researcher has revealed how he gained \"unfettered access\" to a major carmaker's dealership portal - potentially allowing hackers to remotely hijack any customer vehicle from anywhere in the world. Eaton Zveare, a security researcher at software delivery company Harness, made the alarming disclosure to TechCrunch, explaining how the devastating flaw could have enabled cybercriminals to access victims' personal and financial data, track their vehicles in real-time, and even seize complete control of vehicles from any location globally. While Zveare refused to name the vulnerable automaker, he confirmed it's a popular car company operating multiple brands under its corporate umbrella, meaning millions of Americans could have been at risk. TechCrunch reports: Zveare, who has found bugs in carmakers’ customer systems and vehicle management systems before, found the flaw earlier this year as part of a weekend project, he told TechCrunch. He said while the security flaws in the portal’s login system was a challenge to find, once he found it, the bugs let him bypass the login mechanism altogether by permitting him to create a new “national admin” account. The flaws were problematic because the buggy code loaded in the user’s browser when opening the portal’s login page, allowing the user — in this case, Zveare — to modify the code to bypass the login security checks. \"No one even knows that you're just silently looking at all of these dealers' data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,\" Zveare told the news outlet in his explosive interview. The researcher demonstrated the hack's terrifying potential, explaining: \"For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that. But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind-of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.\" \"They're just security nightmares waiting to happen,\" he added, highlighting the industry-wide vulnerabilities that could leave American families exposed to cyber attacks. Fortunately, the carmaker acted swiftly after being notified, with Zveare confirming that the critical vulnerabilities were patched within one week in February 2025. \"The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it's always related to authentication,\" said Zveare. \"If you're going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.\" The revelation underscores the growing threat of cyber warfare targeting America's critical infrastructure, raising serious questions about whether our automotive industry is doing enough to protect Americans from hackers.
