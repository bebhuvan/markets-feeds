    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20489",
    "summary": "We study monetary policy where the price and wage Phillips curves exhibit true curvature. To this end, we propose a New Keynesian (NK) model featuring endogenous adjustment of price and wage setting frequencies, moving beyond the quasi-linear structure of the standard nonlinear NK Phillips curves (NKPC). Using euro area data spanning 1999Q1 to 2024Q4, we estimate and simulate the non-linear model. We then study the recent inflation surge and the implications of state-dependent prices and wages for monetary policy in the estimated non-linear model. Unlike conventional models, our framework does not primarily explain inflation dynamics by exogenous supply shocks. Instead, the impact of shocks on inflation depends on their timing, size, and the business cycle. Consequently, the inflation-output stabilization trade-off faced by monetary policy is state-dependent. For example, monetary policy is more effective in curbing inflation, and supply shocks have larger effects during periods of hig",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20488",
    "summary": "This paper examines long-run unconditional convergence of labour productivity in manufacturing across 48 contiguous U.S. states. We construct a detailed panel data set of state-industry pairs with over 120 industries covering the period 1880-2007. The remarkable finding is a rapid rate of unconditional β-convergence: 7.6% per year in the period 1880-2007, and about 6.5% in each period 1880-1940 and 1958-2007. We also find a steep rise in unconditional convergence from 5.5% in 1930-1940 to 10.6% in 1940-1947 and 9.4% in 1947-1958, followed by a considerable drop thereafter. In the years 1958-2007, the rate of convergence in ICT industries (8.3%) is higher than in 1st-Industrial-Revolution (6.3%) or 2nd-Industrial-Revolution (7.0%) industries. We interpret our results as a process of technological catch up between initially laggard Southern manufacturing and manufacturing industries in the North.",

From the AIA: ABI June 2025: Architecture firm billings remain soft, while inquiries increaseThe AIA/Deltek Architecture Billings Index score was 46.8 for the month, indicating that the majority of architecture firms are still experiencing a decline in their billings. However, inquiries into new projects increased for the second consecutive month and grew at the strongest pace since last fall. This means that clients are starting to send out RFPs and initiate conversations with architecture firms about potential projects after a lull since mid-winter. However, these inquiries do not necessarily translate into actual projects, as the value of newly signed design contracts declined for the 16th consecutive month in June. It is unlikely that firm billings will return to positive territory until the value of new design contracts also starts to increase again. Business conditions remained gene",
