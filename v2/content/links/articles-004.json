    "fullContent": "Misinformation Scholarship Exposed As Liberal Activist Grift Authored by Paul D. Thacker via The DisInformation Chronicle, A funny thing happened when the NY Times reported a month back that Elon Musk’s exit from DC politics had been facilitated by a group of activists targeting his electric car company after he abandoned Democrats, helped fund Trump’s election, and then ran DOGE. In short, Musk supports zero Democratic Party politicians and none of their priorities. Enter Democratic activists who protested against the company run by the party’s main boogey man—protests that sometimes veered into violence and started at the impetus of sociology professor Joan Donovan. Here’s the Times report: The problem with Times story is what the Times journalist doesn’t tell us, namely the function professor Joan Donovan has served at the New York Times and other legacy news. Labeling Donovan a “sociology professor at Boston University,” skips over this purported academic’s role as a central character in the Time’s fake narrative that America is awash in “disinformation” that can only be fixed by legacy media and professors, like Joan Donovan—a misinformation authority who allegedly publishes objective scholarship with neutral, verified facts and reliable truths. “Dr. Donovan leads the field in examining internet and technology studies, online extremism, media manipulation, and disinformation campaigns,” explains one news site. “She conducts research, develops methods, and facilitates workshops for journalists, policy makers, technologists, and civil society organizations on how to detect, document, and debunk media manipulation campaigns.” In reality, the entire arena of disinformation studies has been exposed as a jobs program for liberal activists who dress up in academic garb, to provide quotes to the Times when they run articles claiming anything not published in the New York Times might be disinformation. Here’s just a few examples: August 2017 - Times quotes Donovan as “a scholar of media manipulation and right-wing extremism” commenting on a White supremacist rally; March 2019 - Times labelled Donovan a “disinformation and media manipulation” and vaccine expert May 2019 – Times quotes Donovan as “expert on misinformation” and “misleading abortion-related ads”. Dec 2019 – Times platforms Donovan as expert on political campaigns, who offers this advice, “Politicians must play some defense by understanding what information is out there that may be manipulated.” Donovan was in hot demand throughout 2020 as a quotable expert to anchor New York Times stories on alleged rampant disinformation (spread only by conservatives and Trump supporters, of course): January 2020 – Times relies on Donovan as expert voice discussing “how misleading information spreads in the age of social media” April 2020 – Times labels Donovan “researcher who studies disinformation and online extremism” pontificating on the finances of online streamers May 2020 – Times platforms Donovan as a professor quibbling over what world leaders should be allowed to post on social media April 2020 – Times promotes Donovan as voice of reason on conservative social media July 2020 – Times reporters needed Donovan’s expertise as a scholar on “the terrifying results of unchecked medical misinformation” August 2020 – Times allowed Donovan to pontificate on “conspiracy theorists who have operated in the darkest corners of the internet” September 2020 – Times reached out to Donovan for a story on child trafficking as an expert “who studies online extremism and disinformation campaigns” October 2020 – Times quotes Donovan for article commenting on election misinformation and threats to the very democracy of America, followed by another story on election day “disinformation” some days later. After 2020, Donovan posed in the Times as an expert on militias and far-right Trump supporters; pontificated on media outlets whose politics don’t align with her own; and dimparted strategic advice on the war in Ukraine. However, professor Donovan’s sparkly “scholarly” judgements tend to dull and tarnish under history’s harsh light, a common occurrence among her fellow “disinformation experts.” Right before the 2020 election, the New York Post broke a story based on documents and emails found on the laptop of Hunter Biden that implied he might be getting rich off his father’s name and that the President was aware of this. \"Well we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin ...” Congressman Adam Schiff alleged on CNN, defending Biden weeks before the election. “Clearly, the origins of this whole smear are from the Kremlin, and the president [Trump] is only too happy to have Kremlin help and try to amplify it.\" Frightened by the “RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION!!!” outcry, social media companies began censoring the Hunter Biden laptop story. But when social media companies ceased censoring the New York Post’s election bombshell scoop, the NY Times quoted Donovan claiming the censorship that began becuase of politics had ceased because of—get this—politics. “They are merely reacting to public pressure and therefore will be susceptible to politician influence for some time to come,” Donovan told the Times. At this point, much of the information on Hunter Biden’s laptop has now been validated. And after first claiming the emails and photos from his laptop were not real, Hunter Biden sued a Republican operative for published these very same emails and photos from Hunter Biden’s laptop on a website called Marco Polo. After his father gave him a blanket pardon from prosecution, Hunter withdrew his lawsuit and the founders of Marco Polo sued him for attorney’s fees. I could document other examples of Donovan’s academic musings running uncontrollably like a Southern California wildfire throughout the media before falling apart upon closer inspection, but what’s the point? Her fellow “disinformation academics” have a similar spotty history, including Renee DiResta (the disinformation “hobbyist” bounced from Stanford, now at Georgetown, who seems to have lied about her own history of spreading election disinformation); and Brown University’s Claire Wardle (who once claimed COVID vaccine mandates were a “conspiracy” and then pivoted to defend those same COVID vaccine mandates once President Biden implemented them). None of these academics retain their former credibility. Last summer, the Chronicle of Higher Education eviscerated Joan Donovan in an investigation that ran almost 11,000 words, with several of her former Harvard colleagues correcting her fibs and mischaracterizations, calling out poor research habits, and noting a chronic pattern of making unhinged accusations that lack evidence. “How I see Joan more than anything is an opportunist who will stop at nothing to put herself in an optimal position,” one of her former Harvard colleagues told the Chronicle. “Anyone who’s seen as a threat to that is somebody to be targeted, displaced, and she doesn’t care who those people are.” In response to the Chronicle’s questions, Donovan invented wild claims that shadowy forces were out to get her … including the reporter. “There are people who do want me dead,” Donovan wrote to the Chronicle, in one example, among a slew of texts. Nonetheless, it remains critical to remember the role Donovan, DiResta, Wardle and other “disinformation experts” played in lying to the public that they held some special scholarly claim on truth while they helped censor perceived political opponents during a pandemic that was the most tumultuous period in a generation. The real truth is that none of these self-ordained wizards had any exclusive understanding of falsehoods, lies or medical evidence. Like priests in the past, censorship scholars pretend to possess a unique insight to truth, a lie we can now all see quite clearly. AFTERTHOUGHT Harvard University runs a journal called the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review which publishes prestigious homilies written by the censorship clergy. In July 2023, the HKS Misinformation Review released a survey of “150 academic experts on misinformation” examining their views on the censorship field and its future. As is often the case in academic studies, the best findings can be found buried in the appendix. In appendix A we learn that “academic experts on misinformation” skew in one political direction. Guess which direction! Just take a gamble. None of the “experts” in this field are right-wing or conservative. But around 80% consider themselves Lefties. Does such a field sound like it attracts and fosters dispassionate scholars, or ideologically-aligned political priests? The HKS Misinformation Review’s mission statement says it’s a peer-reviewed, scholarly publication that publishes high-quality research that examines misinformation from “different perspectives.” Now close your eyes and imagine—just for a microsecond!—that this field skewed 80% conservative. Do you think the New York Times and legacy media would rely on professors from this field like Donovan, DiResta, and Wardle to tell you the “truth” on pretty much any topic that appears in a newspaper—elections, public health, foreign policy—if all three of these women professed views that aligned with a right-wing politician like Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene? If 80% of “disinformation academics” were conservative, do you fee confident Harvard would publish and promote their esteemed journal? Tyler Durden Thu, 08/14/2025 - 17:00",

    "fullContent": "On Eve Of Alaska Summit, Russian Forces Make Biggest Single Day Gains Of War The Russian military has gobbled up more territory in Ukraine's east, and is clearly ramping up the pressure - making rapid gains - just on the eve of the highly anticipated Trump-Putin summit in Alaska set for Friday. The week started off with international reports saying the Ukrainians evacuated ten settlements and villages along the front lines - notably among them Bilozerske - as Russian forces move in. This trend continued in the days that followed. The AFP is now documenting more: \"Ukraine on Thursday ordered more evacuations in the east, from a town close to where Russia's army recently made a swift breakthrough, as Moscow steps up pressure ahead of the U.S.-Russia summit,\" the report says. A regional military Ukrainian official who oversees Donetsk region additionally confirmed, \"We began the mandatory evacuation of families with children from the town of Druzhkivka.\" He described that four more villages near the town were also evacuated, and detailed that in total 1,879 children were remaining in the settlements. Russa on Wednesday into Thursday declared its forces had captured the village of Iskra and the small town of Shcherbynivka the Donetsk region. With these developments, AFP offered the following conclusion: Russian forces had on Tuesday swiftly advanced by up to 10 kilometers (six miles) in a narrow section of the front line near the towns of Dobropillia and Druzhkivka. This was their biggest gain for a 24-hour period in over a year, according to an AFP analysis of data from the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW). According to more based on the ISW study: The Russian army took or claimed 110 square kilometers (42.5 square miles) on August 12 compared to the previous day, according to AFP analysis of battlefield data from the Institute for the Study of War. It was the biggest advance since late May 2024. In recent months, Moscow has typically taken five or six days to progress at such a pace, although Russian advances have accelerated in recent weeks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said this is a clear indication that Putin doesn't actually want to end the war, after earlier this week accusing him of \"bluffing\" when he talks about the prospect of ceasefire. \"We see that the Russian army is not preparing to end the war. On the contrary, they are making movements that indicate preparations for new offensive operations,\" Zelensky said in a fresh statement. Putin knows he is clearly in the driver's seat on the eve of the Alaska summit. Trump would have to offer something very big indeed - in the form of territorial concessions and a pledge of no NATO membership for Kiev. However, Ukraine has also said it would accept no decisions from the summit, give it doesn't have any input or participation. They are 'dead' on arrival, the Zelensky government has made clear. Russian officials are attempting to exploit the tactical penetration near Dobropillya to influence the upcoming US-Russia summit in Alaska, but the Kremlin's overall strategic objective is to break the will of Ukraine, the United States, and Europe in order to achieve Russia's… https://t.co/NnyGY3P6uR pic.twitter.com/N6hogaGi0u — Institute for the Study of War (@TheStudyofWar) August 13, 2025 Currently, the US and Ukraine seem to have the idea of a 'freeze' on the table - which would allow for Russian troops to stay in their current positions in the Donbass - but without giving permanent political recognition of Russian sovereignty. Putin may not accept this, as he likely feels he's in a position to settle the issue once and for all on the battlefield, and political recognition would be a forced reality the West would have to eventually deal with. But it's also possible that he could see in such a ceasefire an opportunity to regroup and rest his forces, in order to then later expand operations even more rapidly, and solidify total control over the whole of the Donbas region.

    "fullContent": "Who Has Been Busy Destroying Democracy? Authored by Victor Davis Hanson via American Greatness, “Destroying democracy” - the latest theme of the left - can be defined in many different ways. How about attempting to destroy constitutional, ancient, and hallowed institutions simply to suit short-term political gains? So, who in 2020, and now once again, has boasted about packing the 156-year-old, nine-justice Supreme Court? Who talks frequently about destroying the 187-year-old Senate filibuster—though only when they hold a Senate majority? Who wants to bring in an insolvent left-wing Puerto Rico and redefine the 235-year-old District of Columbia—by altering the Constitution—as two new states solely to obtain four additional liberal senators? Who is trying to destroy the constitutionally mandated 288-year Electoral College by circumventing it with the surrogate “The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact?” Does destroying democracy also entail weaponizing federal bureaucracies, turning them into rogue partisan arms of a president? So who ordered the CIA to concoct bogus charges of “collusion” to sabotage Trump’s 2016 campaign, the 2016-2017 transition, and the first 22 months of Trump’s first term? Who prompted a cabal of “51 former intelligence officials” to lie to the American people on the eve of the last debate of the 2020 election that the FBI-authenticated Hunter Biden laptop was instead the work of a “Russian intelligence operation?” Who ordered the FBI to connive and partner with social media conglomerates to censor accurate news deemed unhelpful to the 2020 Biden campaign? Who pulled off the greatest presidential coup in history by using surrogates in the shadows to run the cognitively debilitated Biden presidency, then by fiat canceled his reelection effort, and finally anointed as his replacement the new nominee Kamala Harris, who had never won a single primary delegate? Who ordered FBI SWAT teams to invade the home of a former president because of a classification dispute over 102 files out of some 13,000 stored there? Who tried to remove an ex-president and leader of his party from at least 25 state ballots to deprive millions of Americans of the opportunity to vote for or against him? Who coordinated four local, state, and federal prosecutors to destroy a former and future president by charging him with fantasy crimes that were never before, and will never again be, lodged against anyone else? Who appointed a federal prosecutor to go after the ex-president, who arranged for a high-ranking Justice Department official to step down to join a New York prosecutor’s efforts to destroy an ex-president, and who met in the White House with a Georgia county prosecutor seeking to destroy an ex-president—all on the same day—a mere 72 hours after Trump announced his 2024 reelection bid? Who but the current Democrats ever impeached a president twice? Has any party ever tried an ex-president in the Senate when he was out of office and a mere private citizen? When have there ever been two near-miss assassination attempts on a major party presidential candidate during a single presidential campaign? Who destroyed the southern border and broke federal law to allow in, without criminal or health background audits, some 10–12 million illegal aliens? Who created 600 “sanctuary jurisdictions” for the sole purpose of nullifying federal immigration law, in the eerie spirit of the renegade old Confederacy? Who allowed tens of thousands of rioters, arsonists, and violent protestors over four months in 2020 to destroy over $2 billion in property, kill some 35 people, injure 1,500 police officers, and torch a federal courthouse, a police precinct, and a historic church—all with de facto legal impunity? How do the purported destroyers of democracy find themselves winning 60–70 percent approval on most of the key issues of our times, while the supposed saviors of democracy are on the losing side of popular opinion? How does a president “destroy democracy” by his party winning the White House by both the popular and Electoral College vote, winning majorities in both the Senate and House by popular votes, and enjoying a 6–3 edge in the Supreme Court through judges appointed by popularly elected presidents? So what is behind these absurd charges? Three catalysts: One, the new anguished elitist Democrat Party alienated the middle classes through its Jacobin agenda and therefore lost the Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court, and now has no federal political power. Two, the Democrat Party is polling at record lows and yet remains hellbent on alienating the traditional sources of its power—minorities, youth, and Independents. Three, Democrats cannot find any issues that the people support, nor any leaders to convince the people to embrace them. So it is no surprise that the panicked Democrats bark at the shadows—given that they know their revolutionary, neo-socialist agenda is destroying them. And yet, like all addicts, they choose destruction over abandoning their self-destructive fixations. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/14/2025 - 16:20",

    "fullContent": "\"F**k That\" - Hunter Biden Rejects Melania Trump's $1 Billion Lawsuit Threat Over Epstein Smears Hunter Biden crudely dismissed first lady Melania Trump’s $1 billion lawsuit threat over his “false” and “defamatory” claims linking her to notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.“F–k that. That’s not going to happen,” Biden sneered with a smug grin during an interview on the YouTube show “Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan” on Thursday. Melania Trump’s legal team fired a shot across the bow Wednesday, putting the scandal-plagued Biden on notice for alleging Epstein introduced her to President Donald Trump, a claim her team slammed as baseless. The first lady’s attorneys have also cracked down on others peddling similar falsehoods, forcing the Daily Beast last month to retract an article pushing the same narrative after facing legal heat. Melania Trump threatened Hunter Biden with a billion dollar lawsuit, demanding we retract our last interview and Hunter issue a formal apology. His response: pic.twitter.com/d4KYqxPcxz — Channel 5 (@Channel5iveNews) August 14, 2025 Biden doubled down on his accusations in a prior sit-down with Callaghan, alleging, “According to his biographer, Jeffrey Epstein introduced Melania,” citing anti-Trump author Michael Wolff and other dubious sources. He went on to claim, “[It is] beyond a doubt that he [Trump] and Epstein were very close friends for a very long period of time. They spent enormous time together — they spent an enormous amount of time together around young women.” Attempting to justify his smear, Biden added, “What I said was what I have heard and seen, reported and written, primarily from Michael Wolff, but also dating back all the way to 2019 when the New York Times, I think … reported that sources said that Jeffrey Epstein claimed to be the person to introduce Donald Trump to Melania at that time.” The first lady’s attorney, Alejandro Brito, has also taken aim at outlets like the Daily Beast for spreading these claims. Veteran Democrat operative James Carville was forced to issue a groveling apology and pull an episode of his podcast after speculating about an “Epstein connection” involving Melania Trump, bowing to pressure from her legal team, according to the New York Post. “Failure to comply will leave Mrs. Trump with no choice but to pursue any and all legal rights and remedies available to her to recover the overwhelming financial and reputational harm that you have caused her to suffer,” Brito wrote in a letter to offenders, according to Fox News. The first lady’s legal threat is the latest development in the ongoing Epstein saga, which continues to generate controversy after the Department of Justice and the FBI released a joint memo last month claiming that an \"exhaustive review\" of evidence from Epstein's death definitively ruled out murder. \"After a thorough investigation, FBI investigators concluded that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on August 10, 2019,\" the memo reads. The agencies also denied the existence of a \"client list\" tied to Epstein, directly contradicting earlier remarks by Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi had previously suggested on Fox News that such a list was \"sitting on my desk\" for review, igniting speculation about Epstein's possible blackmailing of globalist elites. Trump has repeatedly sought to downplay the ongoing scandal, accusing Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, of fabricating a hoax around Epstein to blow up his agenda. In recent weeks, the Department of Justice met with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s convicted accomplice, for two days of interviews in Tallahassee, Florida, as part of a push for transparency in the Epstein case. Maxwell, serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, was granted limited immunity and answered questions for nine hours, with her attorney claiming she was truthful and cooperative. * * * Authored by Jonathan Turley, As I approached the start of my first-year torts classes at George Washington University, we have a rather intriguing tort action being threatened by the First Lady. Melania Trump has been pursuing media outlets claiming that she was introduced to or had close contact with the notorious Jeffrey Epstein. However, the latest recipient of a notice letter is none other than the son of the prior president, Hunter Biden. The letter below focuses on two statements made by Biden in a video interview with Channel 5’s Andrew Callaghan, posted to YouTube in early August. a. “Epstein introduced Melania to Trump. The connections are, like, so wide and deep.” b. “Jeffrey Epstein introduced Melania, that’s how Melania and the First Lady and the President met. Really? Epstein made the intro? Yeah, according to Michael Wolff.” The First Lady’s counsel, Alejandro Brito, wrote to Biden’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, that the statements are defamatory per se. The common law has long recognized per se categories of defamation where damages are presumed and special damages need not be proven. These include: (1) disparaging a person’s professional character or standing; (2) alleging a person is unchaste; (3) alleging that a person has committed a criminal act or act of moral turpitude; (4) alleging a person has a sexual or loathsome disease; and (5) attacking a person’s business or professional reputation. It would be interesting if Hunter’s counsel claimed that the First Lady is technically a “public official” to trigger a higher standard of proof. In New York Times v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court crafted the actual malice standard that required public officials to shoulder the higher burden of proving defamation. Under that standard, an official would have to show either actual knowledge of its falsity or a reckless disregard of the truth. The First Lady has a federal budget, staff, and official duties. In the end, it is likely a moot point since, even if she is not a public official, she is clearly a public figure. The actual malice standard was later extended to public figures. The Supreme Court has held that public figure status applies when someone “thrust[s] himself into the vortex of [the] public issue [and] engage[s] the public’s attention in an attempt to influence its outcome.” A limited-purpose public figure status applies if someone voluntarily “draw[s] attention to himself” or allows himself to become part of a controversy “as a fulcrum to create public discussion.” Wolston v. Reader’s Digest Association, 443 U.S. 157, 168 (1979). Brito is claiming damages of $1 billion notice over statements that are “false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements” made about the First Lady: “These false, disparaging, defamatory, and inflammatory statements are extremely salacious and have been widely disseminated throughout various digital mediums. Indeed, the video has since been re-published by various media outlets, journalists, and political commentators with millions of social media followers that have disseminated the false and defamatory statements therein to tens of millions of people worldwide.” In laying the foundation for reckless disregard of the truth, Brito is citing the dubious source for the information as “serial fabulist Michael Wolff, whose lies were published by The Daily Beast in the article titled ‘Melania Trump ‘very involved’ in Epstein Scandal: Author.’” Wolff is highly controversial. We previously discussed how his sensational claims have been regularly challenged. That led to a rare rebuke from Special Counsel Mueller after the publication of his book “Siege: Trump Under Fire.” The Special Counsel’s office has already made a rare public denial of one of those claims: that Mueller’s office actually drafted indictments against Trump for obstruction of justice. The New York Times reported on the new book as coming out “despite lingering questions about its accuracy.” While Mueller’s office categorically denied the claim, Wolff insisted ‘My source is impeccable, and I have no doubt about the authenticity and the significance of the documents.” The notice letter is ironic given Hunter Biden’s scorched Earth strategy of threatening lawsuits, including defamation, against critics. It did not work. Indeed, Biden abandoned lawsuits after his pardon by his father. Previous media outlets have pulled similar statements against the First Lady. The Daily Beast pulled the article detailing allegations by Wolff that Melania Trump was introduced to her husband, Donald Trump, via a modeling agent connected to Epstein. It ran the following notice: “Editor’s Note. After this story was published, The Beast received a letter from First Lady Melania Trump’s attorney challenging the headline and framing of the article. After reviewing the matter, the Beast has taken down the article and apologizes for any confusion or misunderstanding.” Likewise, James Carville apologized to the First Lady after repeating the claim and stated on his podcast: “In last week’s podcast episode, we spoke with Judd Legum. After the episode, we received a letter from Melania Trump’s lawyer. He took issue with our title of one of those YouTube videos from that episode and a couple of comments I made about the first lady. We took a look at what they complained about, and we took down the video and edited out those comments from the episode. I also take back these statements and apologize.” Hunter Biden is reportedly facing financial challenges and the threat of a lawsuit cannot be welcomed news. Biden has been engaging in unhinged, profane diatribes attacking both Democrats and Republicans. The thrill of trash-talking will likely end if Hunter finds himself yet again in court.

    "fullContent": "Intel Soars On Report US Government To Buy Stake In Chip Giant One week ago, in the immediate aftermath of the Trump vs Intel snafu (which lasted just a few days, until Lip-Bu Tan showed up at the White House and became BFFs with Trump), we said that it is likely that the US government would take a stake in Intel, the same way it the Defense Department did with MP Minerals (a move which we also correctly predicted), becoming the largest shareholder in the rare earth minerals company. The Pentagon took a stake in US rare earth miner MP Materials... when will it do the same with Intel — zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 7, 2025 We were right. According to Bloomberg, the Trump administration is in talks with Intel Corp. to have the US government potentially take a stake in the beleaguered chipmaker, helping support the company’s effort to expand domestic manufacturing, according to people familiar with the plan who may have been keeping a close eye on our X account in recent days. The deal would help shore up Intel’s planned factory hub in Ohio. The company had once promised to turn that site into the world’s largest chipmaking facility, though it’s been repeatedly delayed. The size of the potential stake isn’t clear. The plans reportedly were prompted from a meeting this week between President Donald Trump and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The idea is for the US government to pay for the stake and details are being sorted out, one of the people said. Another cautioned that the plans remain fluid. Needless to say, news of the proposed minority investment sent Intel shares soaring, erasing all of the company's post-earnings losses. In response to a Bloomberg request for comments, Intel said that “we look forward to continuing our work with the Trump administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.\" Any such (much needed) agreement would bolster Intel’s finances at a time when the company has been slashing spending and cutting jobs. It also suggests that Tan will remain at Intel’s helm. Trump had called for his ouster before the meeting over concerns about Tan’s ties to China. It’s the latest direct intervention by Trump into a key industry. Earlier this week, the Trump admin reached an agreement to receive a 15% cut of certain semiconductor sales to China and took a so-called golden share in United States Steel Corp. as part of a deal to clear its sale to Japan's Nippon Steel. More importantly, and just as we said it would, Bloomberg writes that \"the Intel idea also echoes the Defense Department’s unprecedented announcement last month that it will take a $400 million preferred equity stake in the little-known US rare-earth producer MP Materials Corp. — a deal that would make the Pentagon the company’s largest shareholder. That move turned conventional wisdom on its head among investors, analysts, industry executives and even longtime government officials in terms of how private industry has dealt with the government.\" Not too long ago, Intel was the undisputed world chip industry leader, but it has struggled in recent years, hurt by the loss of market share and its technological edge. Tan’s predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, touted the Ohio factory expansion as part of a comeback plan. But Intel’s financial woes have imperiled the project. Earlier this year, the build-out was delayed until the 2030s, and the company said in July that it would further slow the Ohio plan. Since taking over in March, Tan has focused more on getting Intel’s financial house in order. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/14/2025 - 16:01",

    "summary": "Kellogg's Agrees To Remove Artificial Dyes From All Cereals WK Kellogg is the first company to commit in a legal agreement to removing artificial dyes from its products, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Aug. 13.",
    "fullContent": "Kellogg's Agrees To Remove Artificial Dyes From All Cereals WK Kellogg is the first company to commit in a legal agreement to removing artificial dyes from its products, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Aug. 13. “I’m proud to officially say Kellogg’s will stop putting these unhealthy ingredients in its cereals,” Paxton, a Republican, said in a statement. Studies have linked the artificial dyes to health problems, including hyperactivity. Kellogg’s produces a variety of cereals, including Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes. They currently contain dyes such as Red 40 and Yellow 5. As Zachary Stieber reports for The Epoch Times, Paxton began investigating Kellogg’s earlier this year for possibly violating state law by advertising cereals as healthy despite them containing the additives. “There will be accountability for any company, including Kellogg’s, that unlawfully makes misrepresentations about its food and contributes to a broken health system that has made Americans less healthy,” Paxton said in a statement in April. The investigation led to an assurance of voluntary compliance, a legal document that certifies that the company is committed to removing artificial colorings from its cereals by the end of 2027. A spokesperson for Kellogg’s told The Epoch Times in an email on Aug. 14 that the company appreciates the chance to work with the office of the Texas attorney general. The spokesperson confirmed that Kellogg’s will remove the artificial dyes from its products by the end of 2027. “We see the growing focus on health as an opportunity to meet consumer needs in even more meaningful ways,” the spokesperson said. The company has said that 85 percent of its cereal sales contain no artificial dyes, and that it long ago removed Red No. 3, which federal regulators in January said they were banning. Regulators later banned two additional dyes—Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B. They stopped short of banning the other allowed artificial colors, saying they wanted to work with companies to voluntarily remove them. After the announcement, on April 28, a Kellogg’s spokesperson told The Epoch Times that it was reformulating its cereals served in schools so that they would not contain the dyes, and that it would not launch any new products with the dyes effective January 2026. At the time, the company also said it was working with federal officials to figure out ways to “effectively remove” dyes from the products that still contain them, but did not commit to a timeline for the removal. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during a meeting in March that featured an executive from Kellogg’s that companies have two years to remove the dyes.

    "fullContent": "DOE Taps 10 Advanced Reactor Companies For Expedited Nuclear Pilot By Robert Walton of Utility Dive, Summary: The U.S. Department of Energy on Tuesday selected 11 advanced reactor projects to participate in a nuclear pilot program that aims to expedite deployment without Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing, according to a June request for applications. DOE wants to achieve criticality of at least three test reactors using an expedited authorization process by July 4, 2026. Oklo and its Atomic Alchemy subsidiary were selected to develop three of the projects. DOE “is opening the door to the market so new ideas, new approaches, and new designs can be built more quickly and efficiently,” Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte said in a statement. DOE unveiled its reactor pilot program in June, building on a May executive order signed by President Donald Trump that reformed reactor testing. The program aims to expedite testing of reactor designs authorized by DOE and located outside of the national laboratories. DOE cited the Atomic Energy Act’s authorization of reactors under the agency’s “sufficient control,” in authorizing the pilot. “Reactors built and operated pursuant to the DOE pilot program will not require Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing,” the June request for applications said. “Nevertheless, DOE-approved reactor designs can and will be fast tracked for future NRC licensing. ... [The pilot will] provide a fast track to an NRC license, and hence, commercialization for authorized reactor design.” DOE on Tuesday named 10 companies that could access a “fast-tracked approach to future commercial licensing activities.” They are: Aalo Atomics; Antares Nuclear; Atomic Alchemy; Deep Fission; Last Energy; Oklo; Natura Resources; Radiant Industries; Terrestrial Energy; and Valar Atomics. Each company will be responsible for all costs associated with designing, manufacturing, constructing, operating, and decommissioning their test reactors, the DOE said. “Seeking DOE authorization provided under the Atomic Energy Act will help today’s selected companies ... unlock private funding and provide a fast-tracked approach to future commercial licensing activities,” it said in a release. DOE Deputy Secretary of Energy James Danly said in a statement that the agency will “do everything we can” to support the companies’ aim of “safely” achieving criticality by July 4, 2026. “This shows that the DOE is ushering in a new era of building new nuclear in America by unleashing its unique capabilities to enable American nuclear innovators to build,” Oklo’s DeWitte said. “DOE’s selection of a number of projects provides a sweeping injection of urgency to meet the moment.” DOE tapped Oklo for two projects and its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy, was selected for a third. Oklo completed its acquisition of the radioisotope producer in March. While nuclear boosters have hailed DOE’s pilot program, critics say the lack of NRC licensing requirements creates safety risks. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, in May criticized the White House’s plan to move nuclear reactor siting, licensing and fuel supply for some projects outside the NRC. “By fatally compromising the independence and integrity of the NRC, and by encouraging pathways for nuclear deployment that bypass the regulator entirely, the Trump administration is virtually guaranteeing that this country will see a serious accident or other radiological release that will affect the health, safety and livelihoods of millions,” Lyman said.
