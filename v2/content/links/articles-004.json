    "fullContent": "Danish PM Calls Netanyahu A 'Problem', Threatens Sanctions On Israel Via The Cradle Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Sunday that Benjamin Netanyahu has become a \"problem,\" and that she does not rule out sanctions on the Israeli Prime Minister, or even on Israel as a state. Speaking with Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, Frederiksen stated that \"Netanyahu himself is a problem now,\" and that Israel would be better off with a new leader. She said that Netanyahu's government \"goes too far,\" both in its war on Gaza and its ongoing colonization of the occupied West Bank. \"It is settler violence, the additional settlements in the West Bank backed by Netanyahu, and the government's opposition to a two-state solution, which blocks peace.\" Via Associated Press Earlier this week, a minister in Netanyahu's cabinet, Bezalel Smotrich, announced Israel would build over 3,000 new housing units for Israeli Jews in the illegal settlement of Ma'ale Adumim in the so-called E1 zone of the West Bank. If constructed, the new project would divide the occupied West Bank and eliminate the chance to create a contiguous Palestinian state. While criticizing Netanyahu and his government, the Danish Prime Minister nevertheless expressed her strong support for Israel. \"We have a huge political problem with a very, very right-wing government in Israel, which, in my opinion, is currently working against Israel's interests as well,\" she said. \"I can say that because we, from the Danish side, have always been very active in supporting the state of Israel since the Second World War.\" Frederiksen suggested Denmark could use its current position in the EU to impose sanctions on Netanyahu, Israeli ministers, or the Israeli state. Denmark currently holds the EU Council Presidency, which is the co-legislator of the EU alongside the European Parliament. \"It is about political pressure, about sanctions. It can be against settlers or ministers, and it can also be against Israel as a whole,\" she said. \"We do not rule anything out in advance. Like with Russia, we structure sanctions to target where they will be most effective. We are one of the countries that will apply additional pressure on Israel, but we have not yet gained support from the EU member states.\" Despite her criticisms of Netanyahu, Frederiksen declined to commit to arresting him should he travel to Denmark. \"I have no expectation that Netanyahu will come to Denmark. But I expect Danish authorities to handle it if it happens. I have nothing further to add.\" In November 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for the Israeli Prime Minister on accusations of using starvation as a weapon of war against the over 2 million Palestinians in Gaza. ICC member states are legally obliged to enforce ICC warrants. Amid growing starvation in Gaza, Frederiksen wrote on Facebook that \"the greatest need is to get humanitarian aid to the civilians in Gaza.\" \"Blocking humanitarian aid is completely unacceptable,\" she added. Frederiksen refused to recognize Palestine as a state, however, claiming it would be a reward for Hamas for its attack on Israeli settlements and military bases on 7 October 2023. \"We must also be sure that there is mutual recognition from a Palestinian state by Israel,\" she added. \"I do not want to do anything that could seem like a reward for Hamas.\" Some 1,200 Israelis were killed and 253 taken captive during the Hamas operation, which it said was launched to break the siege on Gaza, known as Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. Many, if not most, of the Israelis killed during the attack were allegedly killed by Israeli forces, including by fire from attack helicopters, drones, and tanks, per a policy known as the Hannibal Directive. Israel's war on Gaza may have killed over 100,000 Palestinians - according to some estimates - displaced virtually the entire population of 2 million, and flattened most of the strip. Israel is now seeking to ethnically cleanse Gaza to pave the way for building Jewish settlements on the enclave's ruins. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/18/2025 - 05:00",

    "fullContent": "British Army Colonel: Civil War Is Coming Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, A retired British Army Colonel is warning that he believes a civil war in the country is now inevitable because politicians are unwilling to take meaningful actions to fix societal collapse. Colonel Richard Kemp, who has served on the Joint Intelligence Committee and the Cabinet Office crisis centre COBRA, urges that an alliance “of the hard left and Islamist extremists” will clash with broadly conservative British people and that it will lead to widespread prolonged unrest. Kemp suggests that “together with other causes,” these Islamist leftists will “come together to threaten the cohesion and the culture, the entire culture and political existence of the West.” \"The more it develops, the more unrest we’re going to see… I would go as far as to predict not just civil unrest but civil war in the UK, in the coming years… I would hate to be right on this, but I believe I know that there is no political solution.” I spoke to former Colonel… pic.twitter.com/kxBJlkbqdF — Connor Tomlinson (@Con_Tomlinson) August 14, 2025 Kemp, who fought counter insurgency in Northern Ireland, served in the Gulf war, Bosnia, and commanded in Afghanistan, asserts that the agitators are “fostered by,” and “funded to a large extent, by our international enemies like Russia, China, Iran, and other countries as well.” In an interview with podcaster Conor Tomlinson, Kemp remarks that politicians in the UK are “in a state of bewilderment, they’re like rabbits in headlights,” and that while they understand how the unrest is being fomented, they are unable or unwilling to put a stop to it. Kemp says of political leaders that their “horizon is four years,” and “They want to keep a state of equilibrium for that time, they want to do what they can to make sure they win the next election.” “They don’t want to take the radical sort of action that might be necessary to address these sorts of problems,” the Colonel stresses, highlighting mass migration as one major issue. “There’s only so much that I think people can take of that, and they’ve been very quiet up until now, the people in the UK have not really raised their voices against this, or in a very limited way only. But the more it develops, and it is going to develop more and more, the more unrest we are going to see,” Kemp emphasises. He adds, “they have no option. I’m not encouraging or supporting this, but I think the people will feel they have no option than to take action into their own hands rather than rely on political leaders who are doing nothing, in their eyes.” “I think there is every likelihood, I don’t know what the timeframe is, but I would go so far as to not just predict civil unrest, but civil war in the UK in the coming years if this situation continues which I believe it will,” he urges. “I’d hate to be right on this, but I believe that I know there is no political solution to the situation Britain faces today,” Kemp further declares, adding “When I say there is no solution, I don’t mean there actually isn’t a solution, but there is no solution that any of our politicians are willing to take… because they are afraid of doing anything significant.” As we’ve previously highlighted, these views are shared by London King’s College war professor Dr David Betz, who believes the UK is already “past the tipping point,” for near future civil war. Betz stated earlier this year, “There isn’t anything they can do, it’s baked in. We’re already past the tipping point, is my estimation… we are past the point at which there is a political offramp. We are past the point at which normal politics is able to solve the problem… almost every plausible way forward from here involves some kind of violence in my view.” Kemp’s interviewer Conor Tomlinson notes that Colonel Kemp has never even heard of Professor Betz and arrived at the same conclusion completely independently, Which “makes his well-informed warnings all the more alarming.” The YouTube version of the interview is also below: Your support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.
