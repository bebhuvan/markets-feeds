    "fullContent": "In our Editorial section last week, the most important topic analysed was S&P’s upgrade of India’s sovereign ratings to ‘BBB’ after 18 years. Though the Editorial welcomes the decision, calling it long overdue, it argues that given India’s fiscal rectitude and strong institutions it deserves an even higher sovereign rating. The current geopolitical scenario and India’s strategic shift was the other key issue commented upon in our Editorial section. Our Editorial welcomed India’s tilt towards the BRICS partners in the backdrop of US’ punitive tariffs on India and the resultant souring of ties. Another Editorial commented on ICICI Bank’s significant hike in minimum balance limits for new customers and its subsequent climbdown. It was argued that the fuss over the minimum balance hike was overdone and what warrants scrutiny is the charges banks levy on various services offered including printing of accounts statements, locker fees, fees on cash deposits and withdrawals.",
