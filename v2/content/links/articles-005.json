Speaking to reporters after the raid, Ben Gvir said: <strong>\"The Temple Mount is for the Jews, and we will remain here forever.\"</strong></p> <p>Since becoming a minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, Ben Gvir has led at least 11 assaults on the mosque. Meanwhile, several other far-right politicians have <strong>advocated for the destruction of Al-Aqsa and the construction of a temple where they claim Jewish temples once stood</strong>.</p> <p>Among the hundreds of people to take part in Sunday's raid was right-wing Likud lawmaker Amit Halevi, who has repeatedly advocated for Israel to destroy all water, food and energy sources in Gaza.</p> <p>In June 2023, he tabled a bill that would divide Al-Aqsa Mosque between Muslims and Jews, a plan that would see shared access from the courtyard of the Dome of the Rock to the end of the northern border of Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p> <p>Palestinians fear that the incursions at Al-Aqsa, which have intensified since Israel went to war on Gaza in October 2023, are laying the groundwork for the mosque to be divided similar to how the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron was in the 1990s.</p> <p>Muslims currently have limited access to that site, and just last month, Israel transferred the authority of the mosque from the Palestinian-run Hebron municipality to a settler council.</p> <p>Aouni Bazbaz, the director of international affairs at the Islamic Waqf, the organisation that administers Al-Aqsa Mosque, described Sunday's raid as \"painful and regrettable\", telling MEE that it was a threat to the \"historical status quo and an incitement to violence\".</p> <p>\"There were terrifying numbers of people [Israeli settlers] present and some were important figures,\" he said. \"This was part of a project. The extreme religious right seeks to undermine the status quo and to clearly follow the example of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.</p> <p>\"There are no worshippers here right now, the place is empty, the Old City is empty. <strong>It's a military barracks</strong>,\" he added.</p> <p>The Jerusalem Governorate also decried the raid, and appealed to the international community, in particular Muslim states, \"to take immediate action\".</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir sparked fresh outrage today after performing Talmudic rituals inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, accompanied by an associate who carried out the “epic prostration”, a form of Jewish worship explicitly prohibited at the site <a href=\"https://t.co/pv3aKSaJvc\">pic.twitter.com/pv3aKSaJvc</a></p> — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MiddleEastEye/status/1951940076071473266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>\"What happened today is not just a traditional incursion.

As with previous actions, the protests were primarily <strong>attended by crazed, elderly white liberals</strong>. The Democrats and their NGO machine have lost not just the narrative but are drifting deeper into irrelevance. </p> <p>50501 (\"50 Protests, 50 States, 1 Movement\") is part of the <strong>permanent protest-industrial complex</strong> and was behind the underwhelming demonstrations this weekend. The group's mission is to organize large-scale, <strong>nationwide color revolution-style operations against President Trump</strong>, including these previous events:</p> <ul><li> <p><em>February 5: Anti-Trump kickoff rallies </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>February 17 (Presidents' Day): \"No Kings on Presidents Day\"</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>March 4: Third round of demonstrations</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>April 5: \"Hands Off\" protests, among the largest anti-Trump protests </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>June 14: \"No Kings\"</em></p> </li> </ul><p><strong>Each of the nationwide protests listed above has failed to generate enough momentum</strong> to shift public opinion and move the polls. The dark-money-funded NGOs behind the permanent protest-industrial complex have grown increasingly frustrated; so much so that they reportedly offered $20 million to a 'rent-a-protester' firm. </p> <p>Last month, Adam Swart, CEO of an activist group called \"Crowds on Demand\", called out one unnamed leftist entity ...</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"</em><strong><em>We had to reject an offer worth around $20 million for nationwide, large-scale demonstrations across the country. Personally, I don't think it's effective. I'm rejecting the contract not because I don't want the business, but because, frankly, this is going to be ineffective and make us all look bad</em></strong><em>.\"</em></p> </blockquote> <p>\"One of the more <strong>bizarre highlights of this past weekend's failed protest operation was a 50501 staffer setting up what appeared to be a \"smash room\" for deranged white leftists </strong>in the parking lot of a retail center in Tim Walz's state.</p> <p>\"After smashing a watermelon, one attendee screamed \"<strong>REVOLUTION</strong>\" stating that the experience was \"cathartic\" and left her shaking,\" journalist Savanah Hernandez wrote on X. </p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Liberals in Minnesota are currently smashing watermelons and TVs to help expel their “rage” against the Trump admin.<br /><br /> After smashing a watermelon, one attendee screamed “REVOLUTION” stating that the experience was “cathartic” and left her shaking: <a href=\"https://t.co/9kpKnwojZ0\">pic.twitter.com/9kpKnwojZ0</a></p> — Savanah Hernandez (@sav_says_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sav_says_/status/1951704264184586728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>Hernandez said, \"<strong>Live look at the full event, which includes a scream tent, smash room and about 80 senior citizens</strong>.\"</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Live look at the full event, which includes a scream tent, smash room and about 80 senior citizens <a href=\"https://t.co/bItY4htp3J\">https://t.co/bItY4htp3J</a></p> — Savanah Hernandez (@sav_says_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sav_says_/status/1951704731606204574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p><strong>Related:</strong></p> <ul><li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/watch-rent-protester-ceo-rejects-20-million-contract-stage-anti-trump-protests\">Watch: Rent-A-Protester CEO Rejects $20 Million Contract To Stage Anti-Trump Protests</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/dark-money-network-funneled-millions-no-kings-nationwide-color-revolution-operation\">Dark-Money Network Funneled Millions Into 'No Kings' Nationwide Color Revolution Operation</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/watch-live-house-doge-subcommittee-exposes-public-funds-private-agendas-ngos-gone-wild\">House DOGE Subcommittee Exposes \"Public Funds, Private Agendas: NGOs Gone Wild\"</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/communist-billionaire-accused-funding-anti-ice-riots-mysteriously-vanishes\">Communist Billionaire Accused Of Funding Anti-ICE Riots Mysteriously Vanishes</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/masked-protest-industrial-complex-isnt-peaceful-its-civil-terrorism-playbook-combat-chaos\">The Protest-Industrial-Complex Isn't Peaceful, It's \"Civil Terrorism\"...</a></em></p> </li> </ul><p>One alarming aspect of these ongoing color revolution operations by the Democrats and their NGO complex is the <strong>co-mingling of foreign interests</strong>.

Marsha Blackburn will soon introduce a trio of bills to counter the malign influence of foreign adversaries stateside and cement actions already taken by the Trump administration</strong>, RealClearPolitics is first to report.</p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/693681_jpg%281%29.jpg?itok=52u-cSiu\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/693681_jpg%281%29.jpg?itok=52u-cSiu\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6b5d8879-86fb-41b9-bb8f-bdf202c644f8\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"351\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/693681_jpg%281%29.jpg?itok=52u-cSiu\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/BDC7C33B-9032-4D0A-9660-2635D5588ACF\">The first bill</a> would ban the purchase of “agricultural land” by any foreign individuals or businesses associated with an adversarial country. </strong>Chinese interests already own as much as 370,000 acres of farmland, <a href=\"https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/chinese-farmland-drone-attacks/\">according to one estimate,</a> some of it near U.S. military bases. Fueling <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2023/09/25/rcps_wegmann_to_agriculture_secretary_vilsack_is_the_us_monitoring_purchase_of_farmland_by_chinese_government_interests.html\">the bipartisan concern:</a> fears that proximity to those sensitive installations could make them prone to drone attack or surveillance.</p> <p>Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced last month that the federal government would move to ban sales of farmland nationwide to buyers tied to China. If signed into law, the Blackburn bill would deliver on that promise.</p> <p>While China is the primary target, the legislation would also prohibit purchases from North Korea, Iran, and Russia.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/500EB027-1844-468F-9757-F58AA0D5DD90\">The second bill</a> focuses on the capital city:</strong> It would require the District of Columbia to end so-called “sister city” arrangements with adversarial nations. Washington, D.C., has entered into no less than 15 non-formal arrangements with cities around the world. Some are innocuous, such as Athens and Paris. One is a relic of hopes not realized.</p> <p>Then-Mayor Marion Barry signed the Washington-Beijing Sister City Friendship agreement in 1984 when the U.S. still hoped that normalizing relations with China would lead to liberalization. It did not. Blackburn and other Republicans now warn that “sister city” arrangements, while informal, provide an adversarial regime a sort of soft power through diplomatic legitimacy and access to sensitive U.S. institutions.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/369F964E-58D8-4FAC-8AD9-591CDF6D995A\">The third bill</a> would require the Department of Housing and Urban Development to work with state and local governments to assess whether and how foreign buyers, including those using shell corporations, “are distorting U.S. housing markets and threatening national security.”</strong></p> <p>The legislation comes as Trump shakes up the world stage through a series of new trade deals and reevaluated alliances. Even as the president insists that U.S. relations with China are improving, his administration has taken steps to gain an upper hand in the rivalry with the communist superpower. He has bolstered military spending. He has deregulated the artificial intelligence industry in order to maintain U.S. dominance in that field. He insists that the United States will remain preeminent.</p> <p>Perhaps most significantly, Trump made a rising China a bipartisan concern. While previous administrations cast a wary eye on an increasingly bellicose Beijing, his first candidacy thrust the issue front and center nearly a decade ago. And former President Joe Biden did not throttle back during his time in office, notably keeping Trump’s tariffs on China in place and describing the coming century as a competition between autocracy and democracy.</p> <p><strong>Blackburn shares those concerns. Her current effort focuses on the domestic front.</strong></p> <p>“The United States cannot allow foreign adversaries like Communist China to quietly embed themselves in our communities and near our critical infrastructure,” the senator told RCP.</p> <p>“We have a responsibility to identify and address these threats,” Blackburn added, before describing her legislative practice as an effort that “shines a light on these activities and will help protect American property and sovereignty.”</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T18:00:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 14:00</span>",

It makes no sense at all,” said Max Steier of the Partnership for Public Service.

No previous administration has gotten even close to saving American taxpayers this amount of money in such a short amount of time.”</p> <p data-end=\"1715\" data-start=\"1386\">The administration hasn’t disclosed how much is being spent on salaries, benefits, or court battles tied to the buyouts.</p> <p data-end=\"1715\" data-start=\"1386\">Senate Democrats, however, estimate that the broader Department of Government Efficiency effort — led by Elon Musk — has cost $21.7 billion so far due to errors and waste, a figure the White House disputes.</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T17:25:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 13:25</span>",

Araghchi said that his message to Witkoff has been that there needs to be a “win-win” deal and that the US needs to show real “confidence-building” measures.</p> <p>“The road to negotiation is narrow but<strong> it’s not impossible</strong>. I need to convince my hierarchy that if we go for negotiation, the other side is coming with real determination for a win-win deal,” he said.</p> <p>The US has also shown no sign that it’s willing to give Iran assurances that it won’t be attacked again, since President Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb the country again if it restarts its nuclear enrichment program. Araghchi reaffirmed that Tehran wouldn’t agree to a deal that doesn’t allow it to enrich uranium at low levels.</p> <p>“We can negotiate, they can present their argument and we will present our own argument,” Araghchi said.<strong> “But with zero enrichment, we don’t have a thing,”</strong> Araghchi.</p> <p>He also reaffirmed that Iran didn’t want a nuclear bomb and would continue to abide by a 2003 fatwa from the Iranian Supreme Leader that prohibited the production of nuclear weapons.</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T16:50:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 12:50</span>",

This full-blown affordability crisis is hollowing out the middle class from within. Add years of mass migration of millions of illegal aliens, and the wealth and opportunities once available to the native population have eroded even further. It's becoming impossible to ignore that many policymakers in Washington, seemingly aligned with the globalist billionaires, have deliberately waged economic war on America's middle class. This is precisely why President Trump rose to power. </p> <p>Two of the core bedrocks of the middle class include homeownership and family formation. These two pillars provide economic stability, social cohesion, and long-term investment that sustain a prosperous and resilient society. </p> <p>Alarm bells have been sounded, and the Trump administration had better be paying attention, because a new chart that shows the estimated percentage of 30-year-olds in the U.S. who are both married and homeowners, spanning from 1950 to a projected 2025, has completely collapsed.</p> <p>The chart was first posted on X by Nathan Halberstadt of New Founding, who stated this is a \"<a href=\"https://x.com/NatHalberstadt/status/1951854992995889187\">critical civilizational problem</a>.\" </p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">I’ve heard the horror stories, Carol. <a href=\"https://t.co/EexiHD5zsf\">https://t.co/EexiHD5zsf</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/35736Jw06P\">pic.twitter.com/35736Jw06P</a></p> — Nathan Halberstadt 🧊 (@NatHalberstadt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NatHalberstadt/status/1951635776900415724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>Halberstadt is correct: Young Americans can't afford homes, can't start families, and increasingly see the American Dream as just a dream.

Churches in this southern area have also been burned and destroyed.</p> <p data-end=\"484\" data-start=\"227\">This has brought Damascus under greater international scrutinty and spotlight, though Washington has tended to overlook the atrocities carried out also against Christians and Alawites. However, the <strong>US did oversee the initial truce which now appears in shambles due to this latest fighting</strong>.</p> <p data-end=\"484\" data-start=\"227\">The southern Syria region is poised to unravel, also as Israel appears engaged in <strong>more land-grab</strong> <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/one-killed-after-armed-groups-attack-syrian-security-forces-sweida\">activity</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>A security source told the outlet the armed groups had violated a ceasefire agreed in the predominantly Druze region, which has seen more than 1,000 killed in fighting over the past month.</em></p> <p><em>Violence in Sweida erupted on 13 July between Bedouin fighters, Druze factions and government forces.

I find it a little frustrating to read this, because in Europe it does not feel like we are getting a free ride at all. In fact it seems like the opposite: <em><strong>The most common complaint on the populist German right is that our political class refuses to represent our interests and will not stop carrying water for the Americans.</strong></em></p> <p>I recognise that I’ll never be able to put this right, but it’s worth trying, because it is important to understand the world as it is. The truth is that the United States is an imperial power. Generally speaking, it does not give foreign nations free rides and it does not hand out unearned favours. <strong>There is however a lot of confusion here, because hardly anybody bothers to describe honestly the geopolitical strategy pursued by the United States or the nature of the American empire. </strong></p> <p>Western liberalism cannot conceptualise imperial politics, and while empire generally benefits political elites on both sides of the Atlantic, it is not necessarily or always in the interests of ordinary Americans or ordinary Europeans, which is yet another reason not to talk about it.</p> <p><strong>The Americans and the British before them expended enormous effort to preempt the emergence of a dominant power on the European Continent that might challenge their successive naval empires.</strong> They fought two world wars to stop Germany from becoming just such a power. This great struggle ended in 1945 with Western Europe as a fully subjugated imperial province. Since then, the Americans have coordinated the NATO alliance and guaranteed the security of European countries not out of charity, but because Europe is their provincial possession. As a rule, they have not wanted Europe to assume full responsibility for its own defence, because a world in which America no longer guarantees the security of Europe is a world in which Europe is no longer an American province. It’s that simple.</p> <p>To fend off the Soviets, the Americans nevertheless rebuilt and rearmed the nations of Western Europe. Everyone involved in this project had to come up with a way to allow the Germans to become a dominant economic power again, without displacing the United States or provoking the hostilities of wary postwar neighbours like France. <strong>One solution here was the European Union, which promoted economic interdependency as a counterweight to nationalist concerns. </strong>Another solution came at the cultural level, where Germany sought to allay European anxieties over possible Teutonic aggression by developing a national cult of historical guilt for World War II, which steadily blossomed into a full-blown civic religion. This exercise in self-effacement has grown more and not less extreme over time, in part as a response to nervousness about the consequences of German reunification. Many voices on the right like to portray Germans as victims of an externally imposed guilt regime, but the truth is that we did most of this to ourselves. The German left in particular has profited from and encouraged this mindset from the beginning.</p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"https://store.zerohedge.com/multi-function-survival-flashlight/\" data-image-href=\"https://store.zerohedge.com/multi-function-survival-flashlight/\" data-link-option=\"2\" href=\"https://store.zerohedge.com/multi-function-survival-flashlight/\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b895d05f-00e6-438f-acec-93b26b9313e2\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"289\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/survival%20flashlightJPG_0.jpg?itok=x5lhZCBz\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p> <p>German political self-effacement had one unexpected feature, in that it proved to be contagious. <strong>Within a generation of 1945, many of the victorious allied powers were striving to develop their own historical guilt cults after the German example, in each case centred around a national original sin like slavery or colonialism.</strong> Just as the German political class found it expedient to foreground collective European concerns at the expense of a more narrowly construed German nationalism, so did the broader West develop an overarching obsession with global issues and the plight of the developing world. This has caused the proliferation of a lot of silly people in our political culture, a lot of profoundly stupid organisations, and at least two cancerous ideological systems in the form of climatism and migrationism. We have had a nearly incalculable gift in the form of 80 years of peace, which may yet be offset by the equally incalculable costs of the lunacies this peace has encouraged.</p> <p><strong>Trump’s greatest geopolitical ambition is to reorient American foreign policy away from Europe and the minor rivalry with Russia, towards East Asia and the far greater rivalry with China.</strong> This pivot entails a demotion of provincial Europe in the pecking order of empire. The Americans will want Europeans to pay more for their place in the broader imperial system, and they will be inclined to extend the Europeans fewer benefits. That is what a lot of the low-resolution MAGA rhetoric about free-riding Europeans adds up to, it is the meaning of Trump’s demands that European nations massively increase NATO spending, and it has been an important subtext in the tariff negotiations too. So far, NATO member states and the EU have folded to Trump’s demands with very little resistance, despite their extravagance.</p> <p><strong>The truth is that we could fund our own defence for less than 5% of our collective GDP, but this is as yet unthinkable, because European independence would spell the end of our present system. </strong>Basically, there can be no united Europe without the Americans. If and when the Americans leave, some European nations will pursue closer trade relations with Russia; others will oppose them in this. It has been four generations since any major European nation plotted an independent geopolitical agenda; the very idea is a nightmare for our rulers, and many of the resulting alliances would remind people of unfortunate early 20th-century geopolitical configurations. This is primarily why European leaders have developed such a fanatical obsession with the war in Ukraine. For the moment, the conflict defines Russia as an external threat and suppresses all discussions about the different national interests of EU member states. It is yet another way for Germany’s political class to practice their conventional self-effacement in favour of notional pan-European interests.</p> <p>As in many other cases, <strong>Trump’s policies with respect to Europe represent the culmination of forces and trends that are much bigger than his presidency.</strong> The era of unchallenged American global hegemony is over with, and in this environment being a province of the American empire will just become a steadily worse deal for Europe as a whole.</p> <p><em>Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ZeroHedge.</em></p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T14:30:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 10:30</span>",

President Kaczyński and Prime Minister Morawiecki will return to power [in Poland]. Andrej Babiš will win in the Czech Republic in October, and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico is strong enough to stay.<strong> Then the four of us, as the Visegrád Group, will be able to stop the crazy ideas contained in this project.”</strong></em></p> <p>Orbán’s opposition to the EU’s proposed 2028–2034 budget is rooted in his fierce resistance to what he calls its “Ukraine-centered” focus. Nearly one third of the proposed spending, he argues, would either go directly to Ukraine or be used to service EU debt accumulated to support Kyiv. In a recent speech, Orbán described it as “not a European budget, but a Ukraine budget,” and warned that its approval would divert vital resources away from EU member states.</p> <p>He also reiterated that Hungary will not support the new EU budget unless frozen funds owed to his country are released. Those funds have been held up by Brussels over concerns about alleged rule-of-law violations in Hungary, which Budapest insists are fabricated because the Orbán administration will not conform to Brussels’ liberal agenda.</p> <p><em><strong>“Hungary will block the European Union’s proposed seven‑year budget unless the EU releases suspended funds,” </strong></em>Orbán told reporters earlier this month.</p> <p>The Hungarian premier also repeated his warning that EU efforts to bring Ukraine closer to membership could drag Central Europe into direct conflict.</p> <p><em><strong>“If we admit Ukraine, we admit the war,” </strong></em>he said, arguing that current foreign policy thinking in Brussels is a threat to Hungary’s survival.</p> <p>Speaking about Poland, Orbán praised former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and expressed hope that he would soon return to power.</p> <p>“During the Law and Justice government, you achieved fantastic economic results,” Orbán said. “Prime Minister Morawiecki was one of the best Polish prime ministers I’ve ever known, also an excellent financial expert. Therefore, the Polish government has all the tools to build the greatest era of Polish success in history. If I were Polish, thinking about the future, I would be optimistic.”</p> <p>He added that Poland’s size and political strength under the Law and Justice Party had helped shield Hungary from EU pressure in previous years. “Poland is larger than Hungary. Its political strength during the rule of President Jarosław Kaczyński’s party and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki’s government helped, for a time, reduce pressure from Brussels on Hungary. I remember this very well.”</p> <p>Orbán also spoke positively about Czech politics, predicting a return to power for Andrej Babiš and his ANO party. The Czech Republic will hold parliamentary elections on October 3 and 4, and polls currently show Babiš’s party well ahead of its rivals. ANO has consistently led national surveys by double-digit margins, and Babiš, a former prime minister, is expected by many analysts to regain the premiership after the vote.</p> <p>With a Law and Justice revival in Poland, Fico maintaining power in Slovakia, and Babiš likely to win in the Czech Republic, Orbán believes the Visegrád alliance could be reborn. “This election opens up an opportunity to renew Central European cooperation,” he said. “We call it the Visegrád Group, but we can call it whatever we want. The key is the cooperation, which has been a great success.”</p> <p>He added that past V4 cooperation had served as a counterweight to the dominance of France and Germany in EU affairs, and said he welcomed recent developments, including Karol Nawrocki’s presidential election victory in Poland, as signs that the regional alliance is on the brink of revival.<em><strong> “We’ve opened a huge, powerful bottle of champagne. This is a historic victory,” </strong></em>he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://rmx.news/article/orban-says-visegrad-four-can-block-eu-budget-with-united-front/\"><em>Read more here...</em></a></p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T12:10:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 08:10</span>",
