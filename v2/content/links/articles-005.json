    "fullContent": "Dispute Over EU Censorship Law Delays Trade Deal With The EU Submitted by Thomas Kolbe The United States is fighting against EU opinion control on digital platforms. From the perspective of the European Commission, this constitutes an unacceptable interference in internal affairs, which is why it is now delaying the ratification of the trade deal. In the meantime, the cost of higher tariffs due to the delay is being borne by the European economy. Dealing with the EU is truly a headache. To be precise: The European Commission, under the leadership of its President Ursula von der Leyen, is currently squandering the last remnants of respect and trust it had left after the Pfizer scandal, the strict lockdowns, and continuous attacks on freedom of speech. The issue at hand in the continuation of trade negotiations with the United States concerns exactly this fundamental right of free citizens. Clear Rules Everything was essentially settled: The EU conceded and accepted the unilateral tariffs of 15 percent. Moreover, it committed to purchasing U.S. energy, such as liquefied natural gas, worth $750 billion spread over three years. Whether the market can actually absorb this volume and whether private industry can manage the coordination is another question. The rules are unambiguous: The EU grants U.S. businesses free access to the EU single market, while, of course, the jungle-like harmonization and climate protection regulations still apply. These form the true, complex, and largely insurmountable trade barrier for most international competitors. This intricate framework, the core of the European Commission's interventionism, was accepted by the Americans. From the perspective of European industry, this is unfortunate, but the devastating domestic effects of EU protectionism and the climate fight under President Trump are irrelevant. It is the responsibility of European citizens to put an end to this disastrous policy. Root of the Conflict During the negotiations in Scotland, the U.S. side also made clear that it would not tolerate the massive attacks by Brussels on American communication platforms like X or Meta without pushback. And that is exactly what this is about. Until the final signing of the trade deal between the U.S. and the EU, the pre-set higher U.S. tariffs remain in effect. For Germany’s key industry—the automotive sector—the delay is disastrous. Instead of 15 percent, manufacturers must still pay the higher tariff of 27.5 percent. The burdens add up: BMW, for example, expected tariffs of one billion euros this year. VW reported a tariff damage of 1.3 billion euros in the first half of the year alone due to U.S. tariffs that only came into force in April. The tariffs strain already heavily restricted margins due to climate and energy policies. BMW estimates the margin loss from the trade dispute with the U.S. at around 1.25 percent. A quick deal would therefore be crucial to provide the German economy with much-needed relief in its struggle to stay competitive. Calculation Without von der Leyen A conclusion of the trade deal would be both possible and reasonable. But the German economy did not count on Ursula von der Leyen. The negotiations could now be finalized quickly to provide legal certainty for German businesses. Washington is ready, and President Trump has likely turned to more important matters. His tolerance for Brussels’ whining and endless trickery is probably limited. Everything points to a quick deal. Yet for von der Leyen and her Brussels allies, other priorities take precedence. What this exactly means was made clear last week by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He instructed U.S. diplomats in the European Union to actively oppose the increasingly aggressive implementation of the Digital Services Act (DSA) by Brussels. Cases of abuse and attacks against U.S. citizens should be reported immediately. Rubio also wants active lobbying by U.S. representatives in EU political circles to counter this open attack on freedom of speech. EU Censorship Attack More than a month ago, the accompanying Digital Markets Act (DMA) became the focal point of the transatlantic dispute. At that time, Donald Trump insisted on having a say in interpreting the rules, which, like the DSA, primarily targets dominant U.S. communication platforms. At its core, Brussels aims to enforce its censorship policies precisely on those platforms that are becoming increasingly important for public discourse. Disguised in the politically overused formula of “hate and incitement,” the digital communication space is to be brought under public censorship control. Brussels has likely noticed that counter-narratives targeting centralized eco-authoritarianism are forming primarily on these platforms. They increasingly expose the functioning and objectives of the EU power apparatus. To secure its censorship policy, Ursula von der Leyen and her Brussels apparatus willingly accept that, in the end, both companies and European consumers pay the price of the EU’s control mania through higher tariffs. The U.S. will maintain the current tariff regime until a robust agreement is reached on handling European censorship policy. Washington’s hardline stance gives hope that Brussels will suffer a significant setback in its attempt to establish a digital speech dictatorship. * * * About the author: Thomas Kolbe, a German graduate economist, has worked for over 25 years as a journalist and media producer for clients from various industries and business associations.

    "fullContent": "The US Has Given Ukraine The Most Aid To Date To date, the United States has been the biggest supporter of Ukraine in terms of aid, according to data from the Ukraine Support Tracker compiled by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel). EU institutions (including the European Commission and the Council), followed by Germany and the United Kingdom have been the next biggest contributors. As Statista's Anna Fleck shows in the following chart, financial assistance (such as loans and grants), humanitarian aid (like food and medical supplies), and the value of weapons and equipment delivered is enormous. This included in-kind donations to the Ukrainian military and financial support tied to military purposes. You will find more infographics at Statista When looking solely at military aid, including weapons and defense-related financial support, Germany ranks second, contributing an estimated €16.5 billion. The United States remains the largest military backer, however, having delivered weapons and military funds totaling approximately €115 billion between January 24, 2022 and June 30, 2025. In early March 2025, U.S. military aid was briefly paused, but resumed on March 11 after Ukraine signaled openness to a potential ceasefire. The Ukraine Support Tracker, maintained by IfW Kiel, systematically records the publicly known support pledged by governments of 31 Western countries since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, 2022. It tracks military, financial, and humanitarian assistance, aiming to provide a factual basis for ongoing discussions about international aid to Ukraine. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/18/2025 - 02:45",

    "fullContent": "Rich Londoners Hire Security, Leave Rolexes At Home Over Knife Crime, Robberies Authored by Chris Summers via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), One of the world’s most popular tourist destinations is struggling with rising levels of robbery, usually involving knives, which has led to an increase in demand for bodyguards, experts say. A police van outside the gates of the British Museum in London on Aug. 23, 2023. Leon Neal/Getty Images Will Geddes, a former bodyguard and managing director of ICP Group, which provides personal security teams in London, said, “I get regular calls from the United States, from the Far East, from places like China and Hong Kong, from clients who say ’my family or my sister or my girlfriend or whoever is going to be flying over to London, how safe is it?” “That’s entirely alien to how it was 10 years ago,” he told The Epoch Times. Geddes said robbery gangs often wait outside some of London’s swankiest nightclubs and follow victims down the street before pouncing on them. Knife crime in London had risen by 86 percent between 2014 and 2024, according to a report published in July by think tank Policy Exchange. The crimes were concentrated in areas such as the West End, which features tourist destinations including Oxford Circus and Trafalgar Square. “London is in the grip of a crime wave of robbery, knife crime and theft,” the report said. The U.S. State Department warns American tourists on its website, “Be aware of pickpocketing, mugging, and ’snatch and grab' theft of mobile phones, watches, and jewelry.” In July, 24-year-old Blue Stevens was fatally stabbed outside a five-star hotel in the Knightsbridge area of central London after taking his girlfriend on a date. Three men were arrested in connection to the attack and released on bail. “While we retain an open mind around motive, one line of enquiry is now that this may have been a targeted attack,” the Metropolitan Police said. In a separate attack, five men from north London were found guilty on Aug. 1 of murdering a Greek tourist and conspiracy to rob. Prosecutors said five men targeted 26-year-old Antonis Antoniadis in July 2024, after he arrived at a nightclub in a Lamborghini sports car, wearing a Versace watch and carrying a Lacoste bag. “It seems that when that group of five saw Antonis come out of the club, those robbers thought they had found a suitable target,” prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones said. The men followed Antoniadis’s Uber in a stolen car. After arriving at their destination, Antoniadis and his friend struggled to find a door key. The men approached him, wearing hoods and balaclavas. Antoniadis hit one of the robbers with a brandy bottle as they tried to rob him. He was punched and kicked, then stabbed, causing injuries that led to his death in a hospital two weeks later. All five attackers face mandatory life in prison when they are sentenced in October. London Metropolitan Police head of knife crime Cmdr. Hayley Sewart said, “Tackling violent crime is our top priority.” “Every month across London we are making over 1,000 more arrests than we were last year, with knife-related crime (16 percent) and robbery (13 percent) both falling significantly,” Sewart said in an emailed statement to The Epoch Times. Five robbers—Shian Johnson (L), Amin Alliche (C), Sofian Alliche (R top), Alfie Hipple (R center), and Joshua McCorquodale (R bottom)—were convicted of the murder of a Greek tourist in London on July 7, 2024. Metropolitan Police ‘Jaded Weariness’ Geddes said there is a “degree of jaded weariness” among wealthy people in London. “They simply won’t wear their favorite watches. They won’t wear the Patek Philippes, they won’t wear their Audemars Piguets, they won’t wear their Rolexes, just really in fear,” he said. “I had one client who was walking off Sloane Street [in central London], and it was 8 o'clock in the morning, and a guy comes up behind him and hits him over the head with a machete, causes him unbelievable amount of stitches.” He said the victim fell to the ground unconscious and the robber took a 60,000 pound watch ($81,000) from his wrist. Norman Brennan, a knife crime and policing commentator who served 31 years in the police in London, told The Epoch Times that London is no longer safe. “The reality is that there are areas of London that are lawless. They’re also no-go areas,” Brennan said, adding that the perception of crime was so high in some areas that nonresidents did not want to go there or allow their family members to go there. Brennan, who served six years in a London police squad dedicated to investigating robberies, said people are afraid. He said there were teams of professional criminals out hunting for potential victims. “The violence that they use, or are prepared to use, is ultimate, in so much as they will kill a victim to get their watch or expensive jewelry and money,” he said. Stop and Search The Policy Exchange report makes several recommendations, including for the police department to increase stop-and-searches. It also urges the government to amend current legislation “to explicitly allow ‘without suspicion’ searches to take place in the most intense violent crime ‘hotspots’ at any time.” The report suggests that those convicted of robbery “receive an immediate custodial sentence of at least three years.” Paul Birch, a former London police officer, said he believed the rise in knife crime and muggings is partly due to officers’ reluctance to stop and search people, “for fear of being labeled as racist.” “Many criminals know this and have taken advantage,” he told The Epoch Times. In recent years, lawmakers including Labour MP Diane Abbott have said that black people are unfairly targeted in London when police carry out stop-and-searches for drugs, knives, or other weapons. The chair of the Police Federation in London, Rick Prior, was removed from his position in April for a breach of Metropolitan Police Federation standards. Birch said Prior was sacked after he suggested in a television interview that officers were worried about being labeled racist while patrolling areas of London. Sewart said that although “we do not agree with all of the analysis” in the Policy Exchange report, the police department has called for justice reform. “Reducing knife crime requires a whole-of-society effort and we will consider any initiative that seeks to make this happen,” she said. The leader of Britain’s Reform UK party, Nigel Farage, said during an Aug. 4 press conference that people in the capital are afraid. “I dare you to walk through the West End of London after 9 o'clock of an evening wearing jewelry. You wouldn’t do it. You know I’m right,” he told a journalist. “And that’s just in London, let alone what’s happening in so many other parts of the country.” Tyler Durden Mon, 08/18/2025 - 02:00",
