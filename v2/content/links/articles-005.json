The incident took place on Aug. 13, when police were called to Marsh Wall at 6:07 p.m. Officers claimed in a statement posted on social media that the man entered the property through an open door while “being followed by a group of men” in the street. Police claim no intent could be proven, and the man was not arrested. 🇬🇧‼️ An illegal migrant staying in the Britannia Hotel in Canary Wharf was caught in an elderly woman's house earlier today and was chased out.

Three demonstrators outside the migrant hotel, questioning why the man was not arrested, were themselves detained — including a 22-year-old woman facing multiple charges such as common assault on a security guard, possession of an offensive weapon, and affray. A Section 35 dispersal order was issued in the area, leading to the arrest of a 28-year-old man and a 57-year-old woman for breaching it. A statement regarding videos circulating online relating to an incident that officers were called to at 18:07hrs on Wednesday, 13 August at Marsh Wall, E14. pic.twitter.com/Wj4nNLrjUL — Metropolitan Police (@metpoliceuk) August 14, 2025 The police statement has triggered a wave of condemnation from commentators and public figures. Firas Modad, a presenter at Lotus Eaters, posted on X: “Wait. An illegal migrant enters a home. Three people get arrested. But not the trespasser?! And the person who objected to his presence gets the book thrown at her?” He called out Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, asking her if she would be demanding any resignations from the police force over the matter. British barrister and political commentator Steven Barrett said, “Thanks, Evil Bot 3000, for trying. But do you mind telling your masters at the Metropolitan Police that this is both gibberish as law — and really, deeply, disturbing. Be normal people again.” Rory Geoghegan, the founder of the Public Safety Foundation and a former police officer, wrote: “A world-class police service would recognize that it needs to do more than pump out statements like this. Why are senior officers and comms teams in the UK so afraid of holding proper briefings for the media and public? People are openly talking about the prospect of civil war and that the country has ‘had enough’ — but those in HQ think the answer is a few lines of text?” Conservative political commentator Sophie Corcoran said, “So you’re telling me this demonic-looking man, whom we know nothing about, can walk into a woman’s flat and not get arrested. Women are doomed.” Met Police confirm that this thing entering your home is NOT a crime. But being angry about it is. This is the UK 2025. https://t.co/ZpqKTD5PdS pic.twitter.com/4FT9RtNmD8 — Tommy Robinson 🇬🇧 (@TRobinsonNewEra) August 14, 2025 “Met Police confirm that this thing entering your home is NOT a crime. But being angry about it is. This is the UK 2025,” added nationalist activist Tommy Robinson. The Met Police say they are reviewing body-worn video footage and other evidence, describing the incident as “a complex set of events.” Read more here... Tyler Durden Sat, 08/16/2025 - 08:10",

    "fullContent": "Trump Calls For \"Peace Agreement\" To End \"Horrific War Between Russia & Ukraine\" Update (0748ET): After a night to digest the historic Trump-Putin summit in Alaska aimed at ending the devastating war in Ukraine - a conflict that has left more than a million killed or wounded and destroyed an entire nation- the European Council has released a joint statement. At the same time, the U.S. president posted his update on Truth Social. Historic. Let's begin with President Trump's Truth Social post: A great and very successful day in Alaska! The meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia went very well, as did a late night phone call with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, and various European Leaders, including the highly respected Secretary General of NATO. It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up. President Zelenskyy will be coming to D.C., the Oval Office, on Monday afternoon. If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin. Potentially, millions of people's lives will be saved. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Next, the European Council released a joint statement by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, the European Council president, António Costa and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. EU leaders welcomed Trump's push to end the war in Ukraine. They backed his call for further talks with President Zelenskyy and signaled support for a potential trilateral summit. Here's a summary of the statement: Security Guarantees: Ukraine must receive ironclad security guarantees, with no restrictions on its military or foreign partnerships. Sovereignty: Territorial decisions rest solely with Ukraine; borders cannot be changed by force. Western Support: The U.S. and Europe pledged continued military and economic backing, with sanctions pressure on Russia maintained until a just and lasting peace is achieved.ent, Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, the European Council president, António Costa and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. What's next: Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is scheduled to arrive in Washington on Monday to discuss a potential peace deal with President Trump in the Oval Office. If talks go well (unlike last time), Trump is expected to meet with Putin to push toward ending the war. This conflict, as explained by Putin yesterday, would never have happened if Trump had been president, implicitly blaming the rogue deep staters in the Biden-Harris regime for the mess. * * * Update (2032ET): During a joint press conference following their multi-hour summit on ending the war in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said that if Donald Trump had been president in 2022, Russia would not have invaded Ukraine. This is essentially Putin blaming the Biden-Harris regime and its corrupt Deep State pals. We're sure Western corporate media will be all but silent on this new development. Putin stated: \"I'd like to remind you that in 2022, during the last contact with a previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague it should not...the situation...should not be brought to the point of no return when it would come to hostilities. And I said quite directly back then that's a big mistake. Today, when President Trump saying that if he was the president back then there will be no war. And I'm quite sure it would indeed be so. I can confirm that. I think overall me and President Trump have built a very good business-like trustworthy contact. And every reason to believe moving down this path better to the end of the conflict in Ukraine.\" 🚨 BREAKING: Vladimir Putin CONFIRMS that the war in Ukraine NEVER would've happened if Trump was in office Trump was RIGHT! \"Today, when President Trump says that if he was President back [in 2022], there would be no war.

Both Trump and Putin seemed upbeat about finding a resolution to the war in Eastern Europe.

The leaders didn’t spell out the points that had been agreed and those that hadn’t been. WATCH LIVE: Trump, Putin to hold news conference after talks on war in Ukrainehttps://t.co/pYHE36xFuY — Breaking911 (@Breaking911) August 15, 2025 Putin agreed with Trump that Ukraine's security must be guaranteed, and framed the agreement as a starting point for resolving the Ukraine situation, as well as restoring economic relations. “I would like to hope that the agreement we’ve reached together will help us bring closer that goal and will pave a path towards peace in Ukraine,” Putin says. “I expect that today’s agreements will be the starting point, not only for the solution of the Ukrainian issue, but also will help us bring back businesslike and pragmatic relations between Russia and the US.” He also notes that US and Russian investment and business cooperation have “tremendous potential.” Trump then spoke: “We had an extremely productive meeting and many points were agreed to. There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant; one is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there but we have a very good chance of getting there.” “There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” Trump added. Trump added that he will confer with the leaders of NATO and Ukraine. “I’m going to start making a few phone calls and tell them what happened,” he said. Putin suggested the next meeting of the two leaders should be in Moscow. Trump frowned and suggested he would \"take some heat\" for that.

Trump himself has been busy trying to temper expectations, calling it a \"feel-out\" meeting and the White House elsewhere referring to a \"listening exercise\" on the Ukraine war and bilateral Moscow-Washington relations. While the consensus among Western officials and pundits is that deal to finally end the war is likely yet still far away, \"we do expect some progress in today’s meeting and a path set for further discussions,\" according to Mohit Kumar, chief European strategist at Jefferies International. \"If we move toward a peace deal, it would be positive for the European markets.\" 🚨President Trump is officially on his way to Anchorage, Alaska where he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.pic.twitter.com/MHDw6NzjUx — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) August 15, 2025 Below is everything you need to know (via Newsquawk): Trump-Putin Summit in Alaska on Friday 15th August 2025; Summit to begin at 15:00 EDT/20:00 BST; Trump assigned a 25% chance the meeting will not be successful. OVERVIEW MEETING FORMAT US President Trump is to meet Russian President Putin in US territory at Elmendorf-Richardson Air Force Base near Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday, 15 August 2025. White House said US President Trump will participate in a bilateral program with the President of the Russian Federation in Alaska at 11:00AM (15:00EDT/20:00BST) and will depart Alaska at 17:45 (21:45/02:45BST). The Alaska summit will begin at 11:30 local time on Friday (20:30 BST/15:30 EDT), according to Russian Kremlin's Ushakov on Wednesday. Russian President Putin and US President Trump to have a one-on-one meeting with translators; also to have a wider meeting with delegations. US President Trump on Thursday said that he does not know if there will be a joint press conference with Russian President Putin after the Alaska meeting. Trump will have a press conference however the talks go. Russian delegation to include Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, Advisor Ushakov, Defence Minister Belousov, Finance Minister Siluanov and Special Envoy and head of Sovereign Wealth Fund Dmitriev. The meeting will be the first time the Russian leader has set foot on US soil since 2015. Ukrainian President Zelensky is not invited to the Alaska summit. PURPOSE: The meeting aims to explore ways to end Russia’s war against Ukraine. Russia's Kremlin said the central topic is Ukraine. The sides are to discuss trade and economic cooperation where there is \"huge untapped potential\". White House spokeswoman Leavitt described it as a “listening exercise\" to hear what Putin proposes. \"At the end of that meeting, probably the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,\" Trump said at a White House press conference. EXPECTATIONS The White House downplayed expectations, describing the meeting as a listening exercise. President Trump called it a leel-out meeting. US President Trump on Thursday assigned a 25% chance that the first meeting (Alaska) is not successful; and said he could be more sanctions if the meeting is not successful. Trump added Have economic incentives and disincentives at his disposal for the meeting; would rather not say about specifics. Incentives/sanctions are \"very powerful\". There are no plans to sign documents on the outcome of the Alaska summit between Russia and the US, via Ifx citing the Kremlin; would be a mistake to predict the outcome of the talks. \"All in all, it is difficult to envision a smooth solution to the Russia-Ukraine war through this summit, with Moscow demanding Ukraine give up some territory, a red line for Kyiv.\" Analysts at Rane suggest the Friday summit \"risks side-lining Ukraine, fracturing Western unity and creating space for Russia to delay sanctions, consolidate battlefield gains and promote a US-Russia framework that advances Russian strategic interests.\" Markets will likely focus on several factors: the prospect of looser US sanctions on Russia. how far Russia is willing to go on concessions. any tangible progress towards a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire. TRUMP'S CALL WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS ON WEDNESDAY US President Trump held a call with European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelensky, which he said was a very good call and \"rate it a 10\", while he will meet with Russian President Putin, then will call Zelensky and European leaders. Trump said there is a good chance of a second meeting and he would like to do a second meeting almost immediately which would include Zelensky if the first meeting goes okay, but there may not be a second meeting if he feels it is inappropriate or if he does not get the answers he wants. Furthermore, he said the first meeting is finding out what they are doing and a second meeting will be more productive, but warned that Russia will face consequences if the war is not stopped. US President Trump discussed with European leaders possible locations for a meeting between Zelensky, Trump and Putin after the Alaska summit, while locations include cities in Europe and the Middle East, according to Reuters citing sources. US President Trump reportedly told those on Wednesday's call that he is willing to contribute US security guarantees for Ukraine with some conditions, via Politico citing sources; openness that helps explain the cautious European optimism. Guarantees which are seen as key by Europe and Ukraine. However, Politico caveats that Trump did not elaborate on what he meant by security guarantees, and would only make this commitment of the effort is not part of NATO. RUSSIA'S PRE-MEETING COMMENTS Russian Foreign Ministry says Moscow expects Trump's visit to Russia after Alaska summit, according to AI Arabiya. \"We have a clear position that we will present at the Alaska summit and hope to continue the dialogue\". \"We do not speculate on anything in the future and we have clear arguments and positions that we will present during the Alaska summit\". Russian President Putin said the US is making a sincere effort to find a solution for the Ukraine crisis; US are seeking agreements that are acceptable to all, via Ifx. Peace will be strengthened if at the next stage Russia and US reach agreements in the field of strategic offensive arms control. New arms agreements with US are possible. UKRAINE INVOLVEMENT President Trump said he may arrange a subsequent meeting involving Zelensky and Putin, but he dismissed Zelensky’s desire to participate directly, noting that the Ukrainian leader has ' been to a lot of meetings' without ending the war. Zelensky criticised the summit's bilateral format, warning that any peace deal must be approved in a national referendum and that the absence of Ukraine would render an agreement illegitimate. RENEWED OFFENSIVE Ukrainian President Zelensky on August 12th posted, \"We see that the Russian army is not preparing to end the war. On the contrary, they are making movements that indicate preparations for new offensive operations.” Zelensky added that Russia is moving troops from the Sumy region to Pokrovsky, Zaporizhzhia, and is preparing for a new assault at the start of September. Zelensky said the current Russian push in eastern Ukraine is timed to coincide with Trump-Putin talks. Ukrainian President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that Ukraine will not cede land. Russian President Putin reportedly appears ready to test new nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered cruise missiles even as he prepares for talks with US President Trump, according to US researchers and Western security sources cited by Reuters. Ukraine's military says it struck Russia's port Olya in the Astrakhan region on Thursday and hit a ship with drone parts and ammo from Iran. STANCES RUSSIA'S POSITION Russian President Putin is seek ng to lock in Russia's territorial gains and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. Reports suggest Putin may have floated a ceasefire that asks Ukraine to cede much of Donetsk and to demilitarize Bloomberg reported on August 5th that the Kremlin is said to be mulling options for a concession to US President Trump that could include an air truce with Ukraine, in a bid to minimize the threat of secondary sanctions US and Russia reportedly planning Ukraine deal to cement Russ an territorial gains, according to Bloomberg (Aug 8th). Russia would halt its offensive in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine Russian President Putin reportedly demands Ukraine cede Donetsk Lunansk and Crimea. Putin told Witkoff he would agree to a complete cease-fire if Ukraine agreed to withdraw forces from all of Ukraine s Eastern Donetsk region. UKRAINE'S POSITION Ukrainian President Zelensky said he understood that Russia wants Kyiv to pull out of Donbas and will not advance in other directions in exchange, he added that Ukraine will not pull out of Donbas as such a move would open the way for Russia to attack Dnipropetrovsk. Zaporizhzhia regions, and Kharkiv Zelensky added that territorial issues should be discussed after the ceasefire and along with security guarantees for Ukraine. In a press conference, he warned that Russia wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region, but Ukraine's constitution prohibits surrendering territory. He also emphasized that giving up Donbas would become a springboard for future invasions; he insists Ukraine will not leave its fortifications or open an avenue for a Russian offensive. Ukraine insists on a durable ceasefire before any discussion of territorial issues. According to Politico Zelenskyy and European allies will use Wednesday's call tc push for a deal that demands a lasting ceasefire. Prior reports of softened Ukraine Stance Ukraine could agree to stop fighting and cede territory already held by Russia as pal of a European-backed plan for peace, according to The Telegraph (Aug 11th) Ukrainian President Zelensky reportedly told European leaders that they must reject any settlement produced by Trump, which sees them giving up Ukrainian land they still hold, but that Ukrainian territory in Russia's control could be on the table. This would mean freezing the frontline where it is and handing Russia de facto control of the territory it occupies EU/NATO POSITION EU and NATO leaders insist that Ukraine’s sovereignty and security guarantees are non-negotiable while analysts caution that land-swap proposals risk legitimizing aggression. NATO Secretary-Genera Rutte described the Alaska summit as a way to test Putin's seriousness and stressed that Ukraine must decide its own future he argued that only involving Ukraine and Europe will make any settlement EU Foreign Policy Chief Kallas said on August 11th that the EU will work on a 1st package of sanctions against Russia while she warned against concessions to Moscow. Germany said it will fund a USD 500m n package of military equipment and munitions Polish PM Tusk said they cannot allow the biggest powers to decide the fate of smaller countries without their participation and Russia wants to ink a reduction in NATO troops in Poland to the talks about Ukraine, while he added It will be easier for Poland's opponents to \"play us\" if we are not united. POTENTIAL SCENARIOS AND MARKET ANGLES No Deal [most likely]: Analysts consider it likely that the summit results n no ma or agreement Trump may simply gauge Put n s intentions and then coordinate with Zelenskyy and Europe. Broader sentiment will likely not be too swayed by a \"no deal\" amid low expectations heading into the meeting Limited Ceasefire [possible] This could be seen as progress toward de-escalation: on and potential easing of sanctions A \"limited ceasefire\" could be short-term negative for oil. defense stocks whilst stocks and EUR equities and EGBs could be buoyed Some analysts suggest Russia could use a limited ceasefire to regroup and delay sanctions. US-Russia Tensions Escalate [possible but not in bilateral interests] A further breakdown in relations between Moscow and Washington could see risk avers on and a rise in oil prices. Goldman Sachs: While lack of progress towards a ceasefire may lead renewed threats of secondary oil tariffs/sanctions, we see limited risk of large disruptions in Russia supply given the large volumes of Russian exports the possibility for deepening price discounts to maintain demand, and Iikely eagerness of the key buyers, India and especially China to continue energy cooperation with Russia As a reminder. US President Trump recently ordered two nuclear submarines to be \"positioned in the appropriate regions\" in response to \"highly provocative ’ comments by former Russian President Medvedev Land-Swap Proposal [possible but unlikely to be accepted]: If Trump agrees to a ceasefire that frontloads territorial concessions, analysts warn that Ukraine and Europe will reject it. Such a deal could trigger political backlash in Ukraine and may collapse due to constitutional and public opposition Short-term risk across markets amid progress toward de-escalation and potent al easing of sanctions with energy likely to slip. However, the reaction will likely fade if/when rejected by Ukraine. Comprehensive Framework [near-zero] Neither side currently appears willing to make the necessary concessions. Without Ukraine's participation on any framework is likely to faiI. Risk on. energy sold Goldman Sachs \"While a lasting peace agreement may potentially lead to a relaxation of US sanctions on Russian oil we wouldn't expect a significant short-term increase in Russian oiI supply in this scenario. The reason is that Russian production, in our view, has instead been constrained by CPEC+ quota decisions, low oi: investment, and a strong Ruble Here is what the most likely outcomes are according to a Bloomberg Markets Live poll: Source: Bloomberg HOUSE VIEWS BLOOMBERG: Bloomberg's John Authers citing Christopher Smart of the Arbroath Group says \"European defence stocks should fly on any lopsided deal that rewards Russia's aggression with oil prices likely to slump on even the whiff of looser sanctions on Russian oil... Beyond Europe, markets appear to have long since moved past the 2022 invasion, implying Friday s meeting has little potential to trigger a significant market shift. \" GOLDMAN SACHS: We don't expect the announced meeting between President Trump and President Putin, scheduled for Friday August 15 to cause a significant shift in Russian oil supply in key scenarios”. ING: If we do see some level of de-escalation, it could remove sanction risk from the oil market. This would likely drive prices lower, given the Bearish fundamentals .
