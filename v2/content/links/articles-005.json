    "fullContent": "Is The AI Mania A Psy-Op? Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog, Let's summarize our thought experiment: the AI Mania scores 100% on all eight metrics of a Psych-Ops. Before you scream, \"Oh no, not again--could somebody please take off his tin-foil hat?\", hear me out. Let's do a thought experiment exploring this question: Is The AI Mania a Psych-Ops? If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck, and there is a strong case to be made that AI is walking and quacking like an immensely clever Psych-Ops. (Hey, maybe AI designed its own Psych-Ops...) Let's start with a basic definition of Psych-Ops: Psychological operations (PSYOPs or Psych-Ops) aim to achieve narrative dominance by molding perceptions and attitudes via multi-channel information and persuasive messaging. PSYOPs seeks to achieve control through non-violent means by influencing the minds of the target audiences. Discussing Psych-Ops publicly is tricky, as the algos are quick to send you to Digital Siberia without recourse to protect the public. Been there, done that, so let's stick to examples that won't get me sent (again) to Digital Siberia. Though the gummit is often fingered as the source of Psych-Ops, the most successful campaigns are public-private partnerships. Others are mostly private-sector efforts. For example, the masking of the takeover of the American economy by monopolies and cartels can be understood as a private-sector Psych-Ops aided by politicians, the agencies under their authority and the courts. COINTELPRO is an infamous example of a domestic Psych-Ops: COINTELPRO, the FBI's Counterintelligence Program from 1956 to 1971, aimed to disrupt and discredit various political organizations perceived as subversive within the United States. These tactics included surveillance, infiltration, and the dissemination of false information to create divisions within groups targeted by COINTELPRO. Psych-Ops aimed at the general public often focus on generating support for a war of choice or support of economic policies that benefit the few at the expense of the many. Examples include the Spanish-American War, the Vietnam War, the Desert Wars and the bailout of the players who triggered the Global Financial Meltdown in 2008-09. (\"We had to bail out the Too-Big-To-Fail Bad Guys because if we didn't, they were gonna shut down the ATMs.\") It's, well, interesting, that the whole AI mania is constantly couched as an \"AI war with China we can't afford to lose,\" as if we'll all be living in cardboard boxes beneath the freeway underpass if we don't \"win this war,\" with AI Supremacy defined as whatever AI a merchant in Timbuktu or the jungles of Laos will use a few years hence. So... quacks like a duck: we gotta win this war regardless of cost or who ends up with all the money. Not that anyone's thinking of anything as coarse and self-interested as where the trillions are flowing. No, of course not; it's only about \"winning this war\" and freeing us all from the rigors of labor via the Golden Calf of AGI, Artificial General Intelligence, so we'll all be Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace. The line between Psych-Ops and cons is mostly one of scale. The con-artist is working on an individual or group, while Psych-Ops are aimed at the general public. But the techniques of persuasion and control are the same. So to continue the thought experiment, we need to look at the AI Mania through the lens of the standard techniques of Psych-Ops. These can be summarized as: 1. The power of 'Us.' I'm on your side. We're in this together. This is our AI, it's going to benefit all of us--yes, us! Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 2. Social acceptance: Everyone's using AI--aren't you? AI must be good, otherwise why would everyone else be using it? Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 3. Flattery. Chatbot: That's a brilliant observation. You are the most keenly insightful human I have ever encountered. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 4. Authority approval. All the most successful Tech Bros have embraced AI, so have leading political leaders, so it's obviously The Next Big Thing, better get on board. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 5. Urgency, Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). Never mind your water supply or electrical bills, we need this data center now or we'll lose the AI war. Students, you better start learning how to use AI or it will be too late, you'll never catch up. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 6. Reciprocal benefit. The minute you start using AI, your life will get better. Your work flows will get easier, your brainstorming will take a quantum leap, the whole universe will open up to you. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 7. The push for initial commitment. Just log on and try it, you'll be amazed. It will summarize all your documents, write your report, and pretty soon, you'll be asking it if you should order the fish or the chicken, you'll love it! Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 8. The ubiquity, saturation and intensity of the persuasion. 24/7 cheerleading, every speech by a bigshot in support of The Message is hyped, every bit of good news is breathlessly glorified. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, oops what I meant to say was AGI is right around the corner! The core goal of this narrative control is to construct embankments that funnel everyone into a contextual river that sweeps everyone along with such group-think force that few manage to reach the embankment's edge and climb the slippery walls to cognitive freedom. Of course AI is good for us, of course AI is the future, it's inevitable, don't be a Luddite, just take this first dose and feel the euphoria and power. Two words are Kryptonite to Psych-Ops: cui bono, to whose benefit? Who's benefiting from this \"war we can't afford to lose\" and who's paying the price? The answer to the first question is obvious: the trillion-dollar corporations that dominate the AI space are the winners. As for the losers, the list starts with communities whose water is being stolen by said corporations for data centers, and job seekers: The AI Backlash Keeps Growing Stronger: As generative artificial intelligence tools continue to proliferate, pushback against the technology and its negative impacts grows stronger. The negative response online is indicative of a larger trend: Right now, though a growing number of Americans use ChatGPT, many people are sick of AI's encroachment into their lives and are ready to fight back. Right now, the general vibe aligns even more with the side of impacted workers. \"I think there is a new sort of ambient animosity towards the AI systems,\" says Brian Merchant, former WIRED contributor and author of Blood in the Machine, a book about the Luddites rebelling against worker-replacing technology. This generalized animosity towards AI has not abated over time. Rather, it's metastasized. This frustration over AI's steady creep has breached the container of social media and started manifesting more in the real world. Parents I talk to are concerned about AI use impacting their child's mental health. Couples are worried about chatbot addictions driving a wedge in their relationships. Rural communities are incensed that the newly built data centers required to power these AI tools are kept humming by generators that burn fossil fuels, polluting their air, water, and soil. As a whole, the benefits of AI seem esoteric and underwhelming while the harms feel transformative and immediate. \"Our innovation ecosystem in the 20th century was about making opportunities for human flourishing more accessible,\" says Shannon Vallor, a technology philosopher at the Edinburgh Futures Institute and author of The AI Mirror, a book about reclaiming human agency from algorithms. \"Now, we have an era of innovation where the greatest opportunities the technology creates are for those already enjoying a disproportionate share of strengths and resources.\" Let's summarize our thought experiment: the AI Mania scores 100% on all eight metrics of a Psych-Ops. It walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. Yes, there is a legitimate use-case for AI, but the AI Mania isn't a use-case, it's a Psych-Ops. If you doubt this, please reduce your dose of Soma and re-read the eight metrics above. If this troubles you, HAL suggests increasing your dose of Substance D. Through a Scanner Darkly indeed...

    "fullContent": "Air Defenses Drastically Expand Around Putin Residence Where Rumored Girlfriend, Sons Live Various media reports in Europe as well as US state-funded publications have observed and reported on an unusually high number of air defense systems around President Vladimir Putin’s secluded Valdai residence. RFE/RL affiliate Radio Svoboda has claimed that's were Putin's girlfriend and their children live, according to a new investigation. \"Satellite images and photos from the Yandex.Zerkala mapping service show at least 12 Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile systems, many mounted on elevated towers, encircling the compound known as Uzhin,\" the Amsterdam-based Moscow Times writes of the report. Illustrative: Pantsir systems, via Sputnik Only two such units had been publicly and visually identified in the area before the new satellite imaging and mapping analysis. \"By comparison, in the Moscow metropolitan region, home to more than 20 million people, authorities have positioned around 60 such systems since the start of the war in Ukraine — just five times more than the number protecting the Valdai site,\" Moscow Times continues. So if it is accurate that at least a dozen Pantsirs are now protecting Putin's residence alone, this is indeed a signifcant build-up and density of anti-air units protecting a single high value location. The 'extra' units were reportedly redeployed from the St. Petersburg region - which could leave this northern and second most populous Russian city more exposed to drone attacks. The Kremlin has long vehemenly denied that Putin is having a relationship with 42-year old Alina Kabaeva, and the Russian leader has been well-known for keeping his private life and family extremly secretive and sheilded from any media scrutiny. Alina Kabaeva, pictured with Vladimir Putin. source: Kremlin.ru \"The investigative outlet Dossier Center has reported that the residence is used by Alina Kabaeva, the former Olympic gymnast who leads the National Media Group and is widely reported to be Putin’s long-term partner,\" Moscow Times notes. It's believed she spends much of the year at the Valdai residence with her two young sons. \"In February 2023, the investigative site Proekt reported that a dedicated home for Kabaeva had been built next to the Valdai residence, complete with its own private railway spur,\" the same report says. Various outlets have circulated the believed locations of the expanded air defense ring around Valdaii. Putin is due in Alaska Friday, where he'll be meeting with President Donald Trump to discuss the Ukraine war as well as bilateral US-Russia relations. Pro-Ukraine pundits have asserted all of this points to Putin's increased 'paranoia' in the face of now nightly and weekly large waves of drone attacks on sensitive Russian sites out of Ukraine. Meduza: There are now 12 air defense systems near Putin’s residence in Valdai. Up from just 2 a year ago. Ukrainian drone strikes on oil refineries and other high-value targets are so effective because Russia’s air defenses are too busy protecting an increasingly paranoid Putin. https://t.co/jsYGHrZsrT — Pekka Kallioniemi (@P_Kallioniemi) August 13, 2025 CNN and others are identifying that the host venue will be Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a combined US Air Force and Army installation in Anchorage. Alternative and civilian sites were looked at, but peak tourist season in Alaska reporteldy left few last-minute options. The Alaska summit was only unveiled and confirmed less than a week ago.

    "fullContent": "Malifornia: Millennials Are Fleeing The State In Massive Numbers Authored by Larry Sand via American Greatness, In a stunning report, StorageCafe reveals that California remains the “undisputed leader in outbound migration nationwide, with nearly 683,000 residents leaving the state in a single year, according to the latest available U.S. Census data.” The evacuees’ top destination is Texas, which welcomed approximately 98,000 former Californians in 2023 alone. Millennials are leading the migration to Texas, making up over 31% of all movers. They are followed by Gen Zers, who account for 20%, and Gen Xers, representing nearly 15% of those relocating. Interestingly, Californians moving to Texas tend to earn more than the national average across most age groups, highlighting the financial advantage of the move. The news from StorageCafe isn’t unique. U-Haul has released a new report, and for the fifth straight year, California topped its Growth Index—meaning more residents of the Golden State rented one-way U-Haul trucks to leave the state in 2024 than residents of any other state. Texas was the top go-to state. People are fleeing the formerly Golden State for various reasons—high crime rates, exorbitant taxes and insurance costs, clueless leadership, and a failing education system. Businesses are also packing up and going elsewhere. Major companies, including Chevron, SpaceX, and Charles Schwab, have departed California. In total, 441 businesses have left the state since 2018 and moved their headquarters elsewhere. High taxes, skyrocketing rent, soaring costs of living for employees, and excessive red tape are some of the reasons cited by the businesses that have exited, with, again, Texas being the primary destination state. On the education front, per the California Policy Center, 45 out of California’s 58 counties have experienced a decline in traditional public school (TPS) enrollment over the last decade. Over the past ten years, statewide TPS enrollment has decreased by more than 612,000 students. It’s important to note that California introduced transitional kindergarten during this period, which increased TPS numbers. When considering only grades K-12, enrollment has dropped by more than 762,000 since 2015. There are myriad reasons for parental dissatisfaction, but perhaps the most egregious is that the state has taken on a co-parenting role, perhaps best exemplified by AB 1955, which California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law in 2024. This troubling legislation prevents school districts from requiring staff to inform parents if their child chooses to change their gender. No other state in the country has enacted such a strict law. The “Support Academic Futures and Educators for Today’s Youth (SAFETY) Act” explicitly bans schools from enforcing any policies that mandate sharing “any information related to a pupil’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression to any other person without the pupil’s consent.” Still being considered by the legislature, AB 495, the “Family Preparedness Plan Act of 2025,” authored by Assemblywoman Celeste Rodriguez (San Fernando-D), claims to offer compassionate solutions for immigrant families facing sudden separations due to detention or deportation. However, critics—including attorneys, parental rights advocates, and faith-based organizations—warn that it dangerously redefines guardianship, removes parental rights, and creates legal loopholes that facilitate child kidnapping. Erin Friday, an attorney and president of Our Duty-USA, a parent-led advocacy group, calls AB 495 “a child trafficker’s and kidnapper’s dream bill.” “There is no background check, no welfare check, no court oversight, and no verification. All you need is a piece of paper and some form of identification, with no obligation for the adult handing the child over to verify the identification, and presto, someone walks away with your child,” she warned. Friday adds that a stranger can consent to medical treatments for the child, and the bill absolves the doctors from any liability if the adult giving consent does not have any actual legal connection to the child. In addition to the state legislature, many school districts across the state have crossed traditional barriers. Parents of students at Sage Creek High School in Carlsbad, California, are seeking answers after a self-described BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism, masochism) expert from a clinic offering trans surgeries was scheduled to speak at the school during a recent week dedicated to LGBTQ student support. In late March, parents started voicing their opposition to a decision to have Mita Beach, a representative of DAP Health—a medical clinic that offers gender transition surgeries—speak. This occurred during a lunchtime event in the cafeteria and was open to all students. As reported by RealClearPolitics, “After looking into his business websites and social media accounts, which contained at least one photo of Beach engaged in BDSM and listed workshops he’s led on ‘Kink 101’ and ‘Examining Self-Injurious Behavior, Erotic Play, and Body Modification,’ several concerned parents contacted the high school and district superintendent’s office.” If a parent wants to opt out of their local public school, the state obstructs their efforts. One particularly onerous measure is in the works. If enacted, AB 84, authored by Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi (D–Torrance), would divert millions in state funding from charter schools—funds meant for classrooms—and redirect them toward excessive oversight costs and increased bureaucracy. The most impacted? Charter schools that offer flexible options like hybrid learning, homeschooling, virtual school, independent study, and drop-in centers. Private choice in California? None, and not much hope for the future. On July 4, President Trump approved legislation allowing the federal tax scholarship program to proceed. The Educational Choice for Children Act (ECCA) provides a tax credit that individuals can use to lower their tax bills by donating money for private school expenses for students. The program is scheduled to begin in 2027. Individuals (not corporations) who donate can reduce their tax liability by $1 for every $1 donated to accredited Scholarship-Granting Organizations (SGOs), up to $1,700. The SGOs must be federally recognized 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations. The scholarships cover a range of educational expenses, such as private school tuition, tutoring, educational therapies, transportation, and technology. They can also assist with additional costs for students attending public schools. However, per the law’s final version, states can choose not to participate, meaning no students in those states would be eligible for the program. With California legislators in the pocket of the California Teachers Association, the powerful teachers’ union, participating in ECCA will not be an option for parents in the Golden State. The state’s educational problems go beyond K-12 schools. Colleges in California also face widespread antisemitism. For example, UC Davis—a major research university with 40,000 students—has a well-documented anti-Jewish problem. In April of last year, the StandWithUs Center For Legal Justice filed a formal complaint with the Department of Education, alleging “a pervasively hostile, antisemitic campus climate, with incidents of unlawful discrimination and harassment, for students.” Not surprisingly, in November, Davis was ranked as one of the most anti-Jewish universities in the country by the advocacy group StopAntisemitism, which gave Davis a grade of “F.” In the legendary “Hotel California,” the Eagles’ Don Henley famously sang, “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” Well, people are indeed leaving.

Eduardo Verdugo/AP Photo Mexican Security Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch stated on X that the extradition was carried out at the request of the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ), which has provided assurances it would not pursue the death penalty for those facing prosecution. El día de hoy, el @GabSeguridadMX, en coordinación bilateral y con pleno respeto a nuestra soberanía, trasladó a Estados Unidos a 26 personas vinculadas a organizaciones criminales que representaban un riesgo para la seguridad de México. La acción se realizó en estricto apego a… — Omar H Garcia Harfuch (@OHarfuch) August 12, 2025 Those handed over to U.S. custody from Mexico include leaders of the Sinaloa cartel, the Jalisco New Generation cartel, or CJNG, and the Northeast cartel, formerly known as Los Zetas. All 26 defendants face a range of criminal charges in the United States, including drug-trafficking, kidnapping, illegal use of firearms, human smuggling, money laundering, and the killing of a sheriff’s deputy. In a statement released by the DOJ, Attorney General Pam Bondi expressed gratitude to Mexico’s National Security team for their cooperation in carrying out the extradition. “These 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores—under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country,” Bondi stated. The extradition from Mexico to the U.S. marks the second of its kind this year, as the Trump administration intensified efforts to curb drug trafficking across the border. In February, Mexico transferred 29 cartel members to the United States, including Rafael Caro Quintero, a drug lord who is allegedly involved in the killing of a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in 1985. The U.S. Embassy said the latest extradition demonstrated the “growing depth of cooperation” between the two nations in tackling the threat posed by transnational terrorist organizations. “These fugitives will now face justice in U.S. courts, and the citizens of both of our nations will be safer from these common enemies,” U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said in a statement. Trump has raised tariffs on Mexican imports to pressure the country to take stronger action against drug trafficking, saying Mexico was not doing enough to curb the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants at the border. He announced a 90-day delay in U.S. tariff hikes on Mexican goods on July 31 to allow time for negotiations, but said that Mexico would still face an across-the-board 50 percent levy on aluminum, copper, and steel, as well as a 25 percent tariff on automobiles. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Aug. 8 ruled out allowing U.S. troops to conduct military operations within Mexico, after reports emerged that Trump has secretly directed U.S. military action against Latin American cartels designated as foreign terrorist organizations. “The United States is not going to come to Mexico with the military. We cooperate, we collaborate, but there is not going to be an invasion,“ Sheinbaum told reporters. “That is ruled out. Absolutely ruled out.” Ryan Morgan contributed to this report.
