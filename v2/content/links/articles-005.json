    "fullContent": "FDA Approves Therapy For Rare Disease Without Randomized Trial Data Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), The Food and Drug Administration on Aug. 14 approved a therapy for a rare disease called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in White Oak, Md., on June 5, 2023. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times Regulators cleared Papzimeos, an immunotherapy made by Precigen, citing data from a single-arm, open-label trial that looked at how it performed in adults with RRP and who needed at least three surgeries a year. Patients received four injections of the therapy over 12 weeks following surgical procedures. About half of the participants needed no surgery in the year following treatment. The safety profile was also deemed favorable. “Randomized trials are not always needed to approve medical products and this approval is proof of that philosophy,” Dr. Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “The FDA will always demand the correct clinical study for the specific medical product and disease. Our requirements for products given to tens of millions of healthy people will be different than products given to at most hundreds or thousands of patients with unique diseases.” The approval is the first announcement from Prasad after he rejoined the FDA following his July resignation. Prasad had received criticism for not approving enough new drugs and therapies, including from the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, which said that Prasad “has long criticized such single-arm studies that have no placebo groups.” Replimune’s treatment for advanced melanoma is among the drugs the FDA has rejected since Prasad became its top vaccine and biologics official. Prasad said in May that he favors randomized clinical trials but that for some rare diseases, it would be difficult or even impossible to complete such trials. He said that the FDA would have a “flexible regulatory standard” that takes into account “the context of a disease.” In June, in an article co-authored by FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, he said that for some products targeting rare diseases, “premarket randomized trials may not be feasible.” RRP, which is caused by human papillomavirus, features the development of noncancerous tumors in the air passages inside the body. Without removal, the tumors lead to problems such as difficulty breathing. People with the disease typically undergo multiple surgeries per year because the tumors often regrow after removal. About 1,000 new cases of RRP are diagnosed in the United States on an annual basis, according to the FDA. Before the approval of Papzimeos, there were no approved therapies for RRP. “For more than a century, since RRP was first recognized as a distinct disease, patients have had to rely on repeated surgeries to manage this relentless condition,” Precigen CEO Helen Sabzevari said in a statement. “Today marks a historic turning point.” Tyler Durden Sun, 08/17/2025 - 22:10",

    "fullContent": "Judge Puts Infowars Up For Sale Again As Leftists Clamor For Alex Jones Takedown The establishment media has long argued that the Sandy Hook lawsuits against Alex Jones and his company, Free Speech Systems, are about \"justice\" for grieving parents suffering from harassment. However, the actions of the plaintiffs and others involved in the civil case suggest that their goals are highly political and have little to do with compensating for alleged pain caused by Jones voicing his opinions on the event. If the suit was simply about reparations for hardship of the \"victims\" caused by defamation, then the payout would have been based on an amount Jones could realistically produce. Instead, judges awarded 15 plaintiffs $1.5 billion in damages; an insane punishment designed to bury Jones forever. Because a bankruptcy judge in Connecticut ruled Jones' behavior was \"willful and malicious\" in spreading \"false information\" about the Sandy Hook shooting, his debt to the families cannot be erased through bankruptcy proceedings and Jones could be required to continue to pay on all future income until the the plaintiffs receive the full amount. Meaning, the political left wants to make Jones into a pauper or a slave for the rest of his life and a cautionary tale to others in the alternative media. Furthermore, officials in charge of the initial auction allegedly rigged the outcome in favor of a sale to leftist propaganda rag, The Onion. The Onion did not have the cash on hand to service their $7 million bid for the sale, instead they relied on a deal that would have tapped into Jones' future payments to the plaintiffs, as if Jones' wallet could be treated as a bank account in control of The Onion (otherwise known as a \"contingency bid\"). The Onion offered $1.75 million in actual cash for Infowars assets. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones' name that sells nutritional supplements bid $3.5 million, but somehow The Onion still won the auction. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez blocked the sale and criticized the auction process as flawed. He said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In other words, this suggests that the plaintiffs were willing to sacrifice part of their damages just to see The Onion take control of Infowars and humiliate Jones. But again, the lawsuits weren't politically motivated at all... A new decision by Texas Judge Maya Guerra Gamble in a Wednesday hearing orders that Infowars’ parent company, Free Speech Systems, will once again be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, who will be responsible for selling the assets and using the proceeds to pay Jones’ debts to the Sandy Hook families. Numerous progressive legacy outlets jumped on the story this week, all of them hoping that The Onion will still be able to buy the brand and turn it into a \"parody of itself\". Of course, this would require that they have more cash on hand than any competing buyers. It also requires a level of comedy talent that doesn't exist at The Onion, which means readers would be few and the Infowars parody website would likely fade into obscurity. Leftists have been salivating over the possible dismantling of Alex Jones' media empire for years, believing that the selling of his assets will represent a massive \"victory\" for their side and remove one of their most popular enemies from the culture war chessboard. Of course, even if they were to get exactly what they want, Jones has already essentially won. The leftists are on the run and the national shift has been dramatic since the Sandy Hook suit was decided. Jones has helped to accomplish a primary goal - The defeat of woke ideology in America. By extension, the sale of Infowars is not looked upon as an act of \"justice being served\" by most of the public. It is regarded as a petty sabotage by a fearful, shrinking political minority desperate to prevent the voices of their ideological opponents from being heard. It is not the kind of win that the woke club thinks it is. Tyler Durden Sun, 08/17/2025 - 21:35",

    "fullContent": "Sensex, Nifty, Share Prices LIVE: Gift Nifty signalled a bullish opening on Monday, trading at 24,890 — indicating a rise of over 200 points for Nifty. Sentiment turned positive after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced sweeping GST reform measures during his Independence Day speech, with proposals for slab rationalisation and simplification expected to ease compliance and lower costs. Adding to the momentum, S&P upgraded India’s sovereign rating to BBB from BBB-, a long-awaited boost seen as growth-accretive. Analysts expect these triggers to shift buying towards beaten-down sectors like autos and cement. Technically, Nifty faces immediate resistance near 25,000–25,050, while support lies at 24,600. A sustained move above 25,000 could open the gates for 25,200–25,300 in the near term. However, headwinds remain in the form of persistent FII selling, weaker earnings, and U.S. tariff concerns. Overall, structural reforms and global recognition of India’s creditworthiness may keep the bulls in control despite near-term volatility.",

Nifty Auto index jumped over 4%, led by Hero Motocorp (+8.32%), Maruti (+7.42%), Ashok Leyland (+6.50%), TVS Motor (+6.44%) and M&M (+4.52%). Analysts said GST 2.0 promises structural improvements including rate rationalisation, resolution of classification disputes, and liberalisation of input tax credit provisions. Emkay Global Research called the overhaul a “big-ticket reform” and raised its Nifty target to 28,000 by September 2026, highlighting opportunities in autos and cement. However, near-term risks remain from U.S. tariff pressures, weaker corporate earnings, and sustained FII selling, even as domestic institutional flows cushion the downside.

Nifty Auto index jumped over 4%, led by Hero Motocorp (+8.32%), Maruti (+7.42%), Ashok Leyland (+6.50%), TVS Motor (+6.44%) and M&M (+4.52%). Analysts said GST 2.0 promises structural improvements including rate rationalisation, resolution of classification disputes, and liberalisation of input tax credit provisions. Emkay Global Research called the overhaul a “big-ticket reform” and raised its Nifty target to 28,000 by September 2026, highlighting opportunities in autos and cement. However, near-term risks remain from U.S. tariff pressures, weaker corporate earnings, and sustained FII selling, even as domestic institutional flows cushion the downside. While IT stocks face selling pressure, banks and financials remain resilient. Experts believe easing geopolitical tensions and the S&P upgrade could help stabilise foreign flows in the weeks ahead.",

    "fullContent": "New GPS Data Reveals Exactly Who Showed Up At White House Protests Dark-money-funded leftist NGOs were at it again this weekend, attempting to stage a color-revolution-style regime change in Washington, D.C., right outside the White House. But as with every operation this year, dating back to \"Tesla Takedown,\" the only people these far-left groups, funded by rogue billionaires and some with taxpayer funds, managed to summon were the usual unhinged white baby-boomer liberal, serial protesters at best, with nothing else better to do. Self-proclaimed investor and \"CIA/NSA contractor/whistleblower\" Tony Seruga wrote on X about who potentially attended the D.C. protest march on Saturday. Using device data collected from the area, Seruga found it was largely the same crowd, leftist NGO foot soldiers - or repeat protesters from previous marches... Here's a breakdown of Seruga's data: Device Analysis 318 mobile devices present (law enforcement, media, and demonstrators). 92% of devices had been at 5+ past D.C. protests. 67 devices tied to federal government employees, with access to secured federal buildings (DoD, VA, DHS, DOJ, FBI, Treasury). 9 devices accessed the White House Northwest Gate multiple times in the prior 30 days. Demographics: Mostly local DMV residents; 86.7% from homes valued $850,000, 34% from homes valued $2.5 million. Protest Details Branded as \"Free DC\" and \"Fight the Trump Takeover\". Targeted Trump's federalization of D.C. policing and National Guard deployments from GOP states. Route: Dupont Circle → White House (~1.5 miles). Chants/signs: \"Trump Must Go\", \"Hands Off DC\". Part of broader anti-Trump demonstrations nationwide. Organizers & Funding Led by Community Change and Community Change Action under the \"Free DC\" initiative. Backed by $20M+ from progressive dark-money networks: Soros' Open Society Foundations Arabella Advisors network Tides Foundation Paid Participation Reports of 400% surge in demand for paid protesters in D.C. after Trump's announcements. Crowds on Demand confirmed anti-Trump events drove most inquiries. Soros allegedly spent $20M on crowd-rental services for demonstrations. GPS—there were 318 mobile devices present, including law enforcement and media. 92% have been present at 5 or more past DC protests. 67 appear to likely be federal government employees, with their mobile devices accessing both keycard required garages and federal buildings,… https://t.co/f4y1hiFNv1 — Tony Seruga (@TonySeruga) August 17, 2025 Free speech in the U.S. was never intended to serve as a perpetual vehicle for a permanent protest industrial complex funded by leftist billionaires and new indications that foreign adversaries could be sowing chaos in the U.S., exploiting the NGO sphere: Think Communist billionaire Neville Roy Singham... Communist Billionaire Accused Of Funding Anti-ICE Riots Mysteriously Vanishes https://t.co/NjFnJGKxht — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 10, 2025 What certainly caught everyone's attention was a recent interview between NewsNation's Brian Entin and Adam Swart, CEO of an activist group called 'Crowds on Demand'. Swart told Entin that an unnamed organization offered his company $20 million to recruit demonstrators for the anti-Trump protests in July. He told the journalist, \"We had to reject an offer worth around $20 million for nationwide, large-scale demonstrations across the country. Personally, I don't think it's effective. I'm rejecting the contract not because I don't want the business, but because, frankly, this is going to be ineffective and make us all look bad.\" The CEO of “Crowds on Demand” tells me he was offered $20,000,000 to recruit demonstrators for the anti-Trump protests on Thursday. pic.twitter.com/2A6ezwo0cc — Brian Entin (@BrianEntin) July 15, 2025 From Seruga's GPS data to the interview with the Crowds on Demand CEO, the picture that readers have known all along is clear: the permanent protester industrial complex is bankrolled by leftist billionaires (and possibly group ex-US). Some of these groups were highly successful during the Marxist revolt of 2020 via BLM and other rogue non-profits, but their latest color-revolution-style operation has run into brick walls, especially after the Trump administration deployed federal soldiers into Los Angeles earlier this summer to crush the Marxist anti-ICE chaos. The permanent protester industrial complex will march on - and its followers include unhinged white baby boomers, some of whom look like they were bused in from retirement homes. Old White liberals carry signs during a protest against President Donald Trump’s federal takeover of policing of the District of Columbia, Saturday, Aug. 16, 2025, in Washington.
