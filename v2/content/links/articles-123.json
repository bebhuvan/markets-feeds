    "summary": "Federal Agencies Told To Expunge Employee COVID-19 Vaccination Records Federal agencies must eliminate records related to whether employees received a COVID-19 vaccine, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said on Friday.",
    "fullContent": "Federal Agencies Told To Expunge Employee COVID-19 Vaccination Records Federal agencies must eliminate records related to whether employees received a COVID-19 vaccine, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said on Friday. “All information related to an employee’s COVID-19 vaccine status, noncompliance with prior vaccine mandates, or exemption requests must be expunged from any employee’s Official Personnel Folder,” the office’s director, Scott Kupor, told department heads in a memorandum. As Zachary Stieber reports for The Epoch Times, the office said that effective immediately, agencies “may not use an individual’s COVID-19 vaccine status, history of noncompliance with prior COVID-19 vaccine mandates, or requests for exemptions from such mandates in any employment-related decisions, including, but not limited to, hiring, promotion, discipline, or termination.” The directive came in response to a recent settlement in a case brought by a group of federal employees. Kupor credited President Donald Trump with the development. “Things got out of hand during the pandemic, and federal workers were fired, punished, or sidelined for simply making a personal medical decision,” he said in a statement. “That should never have happened. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we’re making sure the excesses of that era do not have lingering effects on federal workers.” The case was brought by Feds for Freedom in federal court in 2021. It challenged President Joe Biden’s imposition of a COVID-19 mandate for federal workers. A judge blocked the mandate with a preliminary injunction, but the injunction was lifted by an appeals court and was ultimately vacated by the Supreme Court. The case had been proceeding since then. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was overseeing the case, on Friday ordered the dismissal with prejudice. Government attorneys and lawyers for the plaintiffs said in an Aug. 7 joint stipulation that they had agreed to the dismissal. “Our victory is a long-overdue confirmation of what we have asserted all along: COVID mandates were unconstitutional, immoral, and un-American,” Marcus Thornton, president and co-founder of Feds for Freedom, said in a statement. Trent McCotter of Boyden Gray PLLC, one of the lawyers representing the group, added that “nothing can fully compensate employees for the harms suffered, but today’s settlement provides critical prospective relief and shows the Trump Administration is on our side and willing to help right those wrongs.” The settlement, which has not been made public, includes reimbursement of a portion of Feds for Freedom’s legal fees, the lawyers said.

    "fullContent": "Trump Floats Sending Homeless 'Far From The Capital' Authored by Jacob Burg via The Epoch Times, President Donald Trump on Aug. 10 suggested removing homeless people from Washington to make the nation’s capital “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.” In a Sunday post on Truth Social, Trump shared several photos showing tents and garbage on the streets in areas around the capital, saying that “the Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY.” “The Criminals, you don’t have to move out,” Trump added. “We’re going to put you in jail where you belong. It’s all going to happen very fast, just like the Border.” The president warned to “be prepared,” adding: “There will be no ‘MR. NICE GUY.’” As of publication, the White House has not responded to a request for clarification on what legal mechanism Trump would use to evict homeless people from Washington, and where they would be sent afterward. Trump will be hosting a press conference Monday morning from the White House on stopping “violent crime in Washington, D.C.,” but has not said if further details on his eviction plan will be announced there. On any given night, there are 3,782 single persons experiencing homelessness in the nation’s capital, a city of roughly 700,000 people, according to the Community Partnership, an organization working to combat homelessness there. The organization says that while most of the homeless people are in transitional housing or emergency shelters, roughly 800 are without shelter. Trump has repeatedly criticized the crime level in Washington, recently pointing to the violent attack on a young former staffer of his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) last week during a carjacking attempt. He threatened to federalize the city if it didn’t “get its act together.” “Crime in Washington, D.C., is totally out of control. Local ‘youths’ and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent Citizens, at the same time knowing that they will be almost immediately released,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “If D.C. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they’re not going to get away with it anymore.” On Sunday, Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, said the capital was “not experiencing a crime spike.” “It is true that we had a terrible spike in crime in 2023, but this is not 2023,” Bowser said on MSNBC’s “The Weekend.” “We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low.” Violent crime in the first seven months of 2025 dropped by 26 percent compared to 2024, and overall crime in Washington was down by roughly 7 percent, according to the city’s police department reports. After meeting with the president several weeks ago in the Oval Office, Bowser said Trump is “very aware” of the city’s efforts with federal law enforcement. Since establishing the district in 1790 with land from both Virginia and Maryland, Congress has controlled Washington’s budget, but residents vote to elect a city council and mayor. Congress would likely need to pass a bill rescinding the law that created Washington’s local elected leadership for Trump to federalize the city. The president would then have to sign the bill into law. However, Bowser noted on Sunday that Trump could call in the National Guard if he desired, similar to its recent deployment in Los Angeles following protests against federal immigration enforcement operations that turned into violent riots.

    "fullContent": "NVDA, AMD To Pay 15% Of China Chip Sales To US; Report Just when you thought the tariff-tornado had passed close (but missed) the AI economy, President Trump squeezes just a little bit more... The Financial Times reported earlier this evening that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China to the US government as part of a deal with the Trump administration to secure export licenses. According to people familiar with the situation, including a US official, Nvidia would share 15% of the revenue from sales of its H20 chip in China and AMD will deliver the same share from MI308 revenues. The FT further points out that the quid pro quo arrangement is unprecedented. According to export control experts, no US company has ever agreed to pay a portion of their revenues to obtain export licenses. But the deal fits a pattern in the Trump administration where the president urges companies to take measures, such as domestic investments, for example, to prevent the imposition of tariffs in an effort to bring in jobs and revenue to America. In April, the Trump administration said it would ban H20 exports to China. However, Trump reversed course in June after meeting Huang at the White House. Over the following weeks, Nvidia become concerned because the Bureau of Industry and Security [BIS], the arm of the commerce department that runs export controls, had not issued any licenses. Huang raised the issue with Trump on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the exchange, and BIS started issuing licenses on Friday. The H20 revenue deal comes as Nvidia and the Trump administration face criticism over the decision to sell the chip to China. US security experts say the H20 will help the Chinese military and undermine US strength in artificial intelligence. Some BIS officials have also expressed concern about the reversal, according to people familiar with the situation. Two people familiar with the arrangement said the Trump administration had not yet determined how to use the money. Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 18:05",

    "fullContent": "Bill Maher: Democrats Must Choose Sanity Over Wokeness Now Authored by Matt Margolis via PJMedia.com, Bill Maher continues to carve out a unique position as a leftist who openly challenges the woke left from within his own party. As I've pointed out before, Bill Maher may be a leftist, but he's spoken out repeatedly against the woke left, and that’s a good thing that I hope helps move the party away from crazy. It’s not working yet, but dare to dream. His critiques have been sharp and unrelenting, exposing the destructive elements that have taken hold in portions of the Democratic Party. Yet Maher’s disdain for the woke left is not just comic disdain; it’s rooted in a deep frustration with how the progressive wing is unraveling the party and the nation. Whether it’s calling out the ridiculous outrage over the Sydney Sweeney ads or admitting that President Donald Trump was right about tariffs, Maher has shown an ability to be honest about the issues without blindly following the party line. Yes, Maher may be a leftist who hates Trump, but he recognizes that woke activists are destroying his party. Maher is not just mocking woke excess; he’s demanding a serious reckoning. His most recent monologue challenged Democrats to confront a fundamental question: Do they support the values of Western civilization? “The world is a complicated place, and it’s not just about oppressor and oppressed,” Maher said recently. “They have a thought in their head that white people did some very bad things — and white people did some very bad things — but so did everybody else in the world. But they don’t know that. They just see the world through this one prism. And until they do, I don’t think you’re gonna get them off this issue, and I don’t think the Democratic Party is gonna be able to go forward until they make a decision. Whose side are you on here? Are you on the side of Western civilization and Western values, or are you on the side of the terrorists?” Maher zeroed in on intersectionality as the first wave of the woke “infection,” an idea that repackages historical grievances into racial hierarchy dogma that unfairly demonizes white people alone. Maher’s challenge to Democrats is radical in its clarity: it’s time to decide if you stand with the values that built the West or if you side with terrorists. He warned chillingly that many Democrats are only a step away from aligning with Hamas, with some already there. That is the stark reality Maher is laying bare. In his words, “Are you with those kids because, you know, Mandami, he’s the perfect candidate for them?” The warning here is not subtle. If Democrats continue to embrace the woke core that sympathizes with radical ideologies over patriotism and Western values, their collapse is assured. NEW: Bill Maher says the Democrat Party won’t survive unless it chooses—stand with Western civilization, or COLLAPSE trying to appease the radical fringe. With Democrat approval ratings crashing below 33%, Maher just NUKED the party’s identity crisis on national TV. “The world… pic.twitter.com/gcfBHnbz04 — The Vigilant Fox 🦊 (@VigilantFox) August 2, 2025 Bill Maher cuts through the absurdity of the woke left’s claims. Whether you agree with his broader politics or not, Maher is signaling that the battle for the soul of the Democratic Party and America is no longer a game. It’s a choice between sanity and self-immolation. And so far, Bill Maher is shouting for sanity to prevail. Bill Maher slices right through the woke left’s nonsense with the kind of blunt honesty that’s becoming rare in his party. Whether you agree with his broader politics or not, he couldn’t be clearer: the fight for the soul of the Democratic Party and the future of the country are no longer a sideshow. We’ve reached a crossroads between common sense and political self-destruction. And right now, Maher is one of the loudest voices urging his side to choose sanity before it’s too late, warning that the alternative is a permanent descent into madness. The woke left’s madness is tearing America apart—and even Bill Maher is sounding the alarm from inside the left. Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 17:30",

    "fullContent": "S&P 500 Healthcare Weighting At Multi-Decade Lows Earnings season has ended for large-cap biopharma stocks, with steep selloffs across many names as the healthcare sector's weighting in the S&P 500 falls to a multi-decade low. Pessimism is elevated across the sector amid the Trump administration's Most Favored Nation (MFN) pricing proposal for Medicaid and the prospect of pharmaceutical tariffs. A Goldman Sachs team led by Asad Haider told clients Friday that healthcare stocks face weak sector performance and mounting pessimism, as earnings season wrapped up last week. Here are some of the highlights of the note titled \"Global Healthcare: Pharmaceuticals: Friday Fodder: Slimmer Positioning Into The August Lull\": Earnings season ended with large selloffs in two key growth names: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (-20.6% on Aug. 4, pain program setback) and Eli Lilly And Co crshed the most since the DotCom era after underwhelming oral GLP-1 pill data. This followed earlier 10% to 20% post-earnings drops in other large-cap healthcare \"quality\" names (Novo Nordisk, McKesson Corp, UnitedHealth Group, Intuitive Surgical). Healthcare stocks have moved an average of ±6% on earnings this season ... some of the highest volatility on record. S&P 500 healthcare weighting now at multi-decade lows. What's causing some of the gloom and doom across healthcare stocks? Well, it's policy overhangs: Investor focus remains on the Trump administration's MFN pricing proposal for Medicaid and possible pharmaceutical tariffs from ongoing Section 232 investigations (potentially mid-August). Administration's 100% tariff on chips exempts U.S.-based manufacturing, relevant as pharma companies boost domestic production. Pfizer first to embed MFN scenarios into guidance; LLY open to gradual U.S. and EU price rebalancing, starting with new products.

Here's Goldman analyst Salveen Ritcher's big picture view on healthcare: Big Picture: Although the biotechnology sector has recovered with the broader market since April lows (XBI/NBI/S&P 500 are up ~1/3/2% over the last month), we see the potential for further volatility in 2H+ as policy dynamics (e.g., tariffs/tax policy, drug pricing/Medicaid cuts, FDA/HHS, etc.) evolve. We continue to monitor the administration's proposal to incorporate MFN pricing into Medicaid, and await a likely announcement regarding pharmaceutical tariffs upon the conclusion of the ongoing Section 232 investigations (potentially by mid-August, per our U.S. economists, although delays are possible), noting pharmaceuticals were excluded from the recently announced US-EU trade deal (establishing a 15% baseline tariff rate for most EU imports) pending Section 232 investigation conclusion. Pro Subs can read the full note in the usual place. Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 16:55",

    "fullContent": "There Are Three Main Themes Driving Markets By Peter Tchir of Academy Securities It’s a summer Sunday, so hopefully you aren’t spending too much time on T-Reports. If you missed last weekend’s Fixing the Data, please read. Had a lot of interesting conversations on the topic this weekend. Anything from jobs data, to more broadly, all data collection, to worries about “fabricating” data. Since Garbage In, Garbage Out has been such a long-running theme in T-Reports, it is exciting that it is near the top of everyone’s list of issues. In a completely different direction, if you are on vacation somewhere, check out our piece titled - Could The U.S. License Privateers to Combat Crypto Theft? A little more “out there” in terms of thought pieces, but something we find interesting and a great starting point for discussion. Wound up on the Wolf of All Streets (more of a crypto show than traditional finance media), but we had a great discussion around crypto treasury companies (access), stablecoins (the potential growth), and Ethereum as being the more institutionally palatable use case out there. In the meantime, we think there are three main themes driving markets. Each of which has some potential positives as well as some potential downside associated with it. Finally, outside of that construct, it is well worth thinking about what is next on the President’s to do list. He has checked off a lot of boxes already (for better or worse depending on your perspective) but there are more items on the horizon that could affect your investments. Tariffs and Trade The clear positives are: Generating revenue (for now). Whatever you (or I) think about tariffs, they have been and will continue to generate revenue for the U.S. government. We’ve sent charts on this and it is real income to the government. It remains to be seen who will ultimately pay for it (and we think it will take quarters before that becomes evident). There is some risk that existing tariffs, executed under certain emergency clauses, may be deemed invalid. Ultimately we are months away from this, as it will go to the Supreme Court, no matter what the next ruling is. There is a market (I’m told) for trading paid tariff duties. If they are overturned, even if the administration invokes different rules to implement them, there might be rebates available to those who paid. I think this is months away from any certainty, but it could hurt the deficit and may cause some countries to “slow play” deals they have apparently agreed to in principle. Deals and investment. There have been a lot of commitments to investing in the U.S. via some of the trade deals. International airlines buying U.S. planes (great but weren’t they going to anyways?). Chips (ditto). U.S. military equipment (ditto). Enforceable? Who knows. The deals are interesting, but with the exception of opening up markets to top chips from the U.S. (where sales were restricted, not by demand, but by U.S. rules), not sure how much has been truly added to the economy. The potential negatives are: If someone with the flu sneezes on you, and you don’t have flu-like symptoms within 10 minutes, it doesn’t mean that you don’t have the flu. So many victory laps on “tariffs have been absorbed” when they’ve barely hit the economy. Importers still have inventories of non-tariffed goods and haven’t begun finalizing future deals with suppliers, let alone their customers. We live in an era where so much information is available instantaneously that we sometimes forget these things take time. On balance, I think markets are a bit complacent on the risks of tariffs to consumption and corporate profits (I am less worried about inflation, but that is because I’m more worried about the overall economy). AI and Big Data The positives are obvious: The capital spending on data, AI, etc., has been driving corporate spending. We live in a world where the more you spend, the more your value increases (a bit of hyperbole, but not too far off base). How long can that continue? But the reality is that so many companies, faced with uncertainty, decided it was best to spend more on AI/Efficiency than anything else, as true efficiency (if achieved) will be important regardless of the direction of the economy. Stock returns have been driven by AI. Not here to argue about breadth, etc., but the Russell 2000 is up less than 1% on the year, while the Nasdaq 100 is up around 13%. I have read, but not verified, that even within the Nasdaq 100 the returns have been concentrated to a handful of stocks. The “mixed” impact: For anyone who equates energy with oil, you are just dead wrong (I’m trying to retrain my brain on this). Energy is electricity. The demand for electricity (aka energy) will drive innovation, new businesses, and huge opportunities for investors and companies. It may also lead to backlash as many individuals (consumers of a regulated product in most jurisdictions) may become concerned about how energy is allocated when you have demand from customers who might have a much higher price point (due to the revenue they are generating) than the average individual. Not at the “pitchforks” stage, but I can see some battlegrounds developing as the intense demand for electricity potentially competes with the traditional consumer. But make no mistake, the opportunities for those who can deliver the electricity efficiently is big! The downside? Jobless economy? While that take is a bit extreme, one does have to wonder what the job outlook is for many employees who will now effectively have to compete with AI? The best and brightest (and hopefully those that write the T-Report) will be able to use the new technology to enhance their product. But how many “minions” won’t be able to do that? The weakness in the job market amongst recent college graduates (and the spike in law school applications) is worrisome for our economy. Our society has been built on these “entry level” jobs creating the opportunity to rise up the corporate ladder. Does that disappear, shrink dramatically, or just change who makes money?. We don’t know, but something to keep an eye on. The energy play seems obvious, but a little less clear is what is left for the companies directly benefiting. There is also a lot to be seen on the job front and whether the technology is truly cost effective. The cost is rising, and it is unclear what level of “decisions” will be trusted to machines. ProSec National Production for National Security is quite a mouthful. “Drill Baby Drill” is catchy, but too limited to oil. “Refine baby Refine” was an attempt to point out that it is the refined/processed versions of rare earths and critical minerals that are in short supply and dominated by China. This administration still seems too focused (in my opinion) on access to the rare earths and critical minerals, and is not spending enough time on ensuring that the U.S. can refine and process them. We can find sellers of the commodities, but it is the next step that is crucial and we need to do more – though we’ve seen some progress on that. “National Production for National Security” tried to take this a step further. It is Chips. Pharma. Healthcare. Basically, any number of things that a country needs to produce (at some base level) to ensure their security. ProSec tries to refine this further. Production for Security is so much simpler than National Production for National Security. It isn’t up there with BRICs or Mag 7, but it is getting closer? Security goes well beyond national security. Job/Income security. If you know your country is supporting your job in a way that it didn’t previously, you have a lot more “security.” You don’t fret after every meal about what “bad things” might happen. It lets you dream. It lets you invest in the future. While I’m not saying “National Security” doesn’t matter, I am saying that it is easy to underestimate the sense of peace people can have knowing their careers are safe and they can plan for the future. While it wasn’t incorrect to focus on National Security, it was too restrictive. Security comes in many shapes and forms, all of which are important to the economy and the health of a country. I always live in constant fear of this being the “last T-Report”, and AI has done little to help that, but if we can bring a lot of industry (and national importance) back to the U.S., it will help the “vibe” of the country. More on this in future reports. Deregulation. That’s it. That’s the entire section. Deregulation. Deregulation. Deregulation. It is something the President excels at and something we need, especially if ProSec is going to reach its full potential. The Presidential “To Do” List My understanding, from those who have worked with Trump before and those that “know” the current administration, is that he is well aware of the promises he made, and the expectation that he delivers. There are a few things currently out there that may impact markets. Russia/Ukraine Truce. This is out there and something we cover in SITREPs, but it does seem that it is impacting energy prices (secondary sanctions) and also potentially straining relations with Europe again (potentially giving Russia too much land, etc.). Again, we will dive deeper into this in a future SITREP as the President prepares to meet with Putin. Somewhat related, but off the radar, is the risk that the President goes after Brazil’s purchase of Russian Diesel. For those of us stuck with Energy = Oil, that is too simplistic. We’ve already started trying to condition ourselves to see Energy = Electricity, but we’ve also been trying to point out that oil is somewhat useless. Gasoline and Diesel are very useful. Currently Brazil is buying a lot of Russian Diesel and given the 50% tariffs linked (potentially questionably) to Bolsonaro, we could see other tariffs imposed on their purchases of diesel. That could upset markets more than sanctions on oil. Marijuana Rescheduling. We’ve seen stocks in this sector bounce recently (MSOS as an example of an ETF linked to the sector), but I am not getting a sense that this is a high priority. The current scheduling seems so arbitrary, that it could be shifted, and likely will be, but when you compare this admin’s focus on crypto to marijuana, one clearly resonates and the other seems to be a “sidebar” at best. Cruise ships. There was fear that the “Big Beautiful Bill” would target registrations (and tax implications) for the cruise industry. It didn’t happen, but this is the exact sort of thing that could resonate with the President now that he has “ticked the box” on so many other issues. If there is any President who would “love” to see big beautiful American flags flying from every cruise ship and generating as much tax revenue as possible from the industry, it would seem to be this President. Watch out for some headlines on this front. Bottom Line A few competing narratives, all of which have some upside potential, with downside risk. Tariffs have seen too much good and not enough bad priced in, but it is at the margin and will take time to show up in the data. Rent declines and a slowing economy mean that tariffs are more likely to hit corporate profits than create inflation. The direct AI beneficiaries have benefited so much that each incremental dollar of upside is more difficult to achieve. The demand for electricity, already somewhat priced in, seems to have more upside. The risk to jobs and a slowdown in the economy (losing what used to be “entry level” or even “mid-level” corporate jobs), resulting from advancements in AI will take a toll on employment and spending, and not enough fear of that is out there. ProSec is my focus on the long side of risk assets. And even on the job front, while AI may displace certain jobs, ProSec may not only create new jobs, but it will also create jobs with a higher degree of “security” (certainty), which is a benefit in and of itself. Don’t forget the To Do list. While many big issues have been addressed/tackled, there are a lot of other issues that the admin will likely focus on in the coming months, and getting those right at the margin will influence returns. This was not AI generated, but hopefully still useful. Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 16:20",

    "fullContent": "Japanese Automakers Losing $20 Million Per Day To U.S. Tariffs Japanese automakers are losing an estimated 3 billion yen ($20.3 million) in combined profits every day the U.S. delays lowering auto tariffs, according to company data, according to Nikkei Asia. The full-year hit from the duties is projected at 2.7 trillion yen ($18.3 billion), dragging aggregate operating profit down 36% for six major producers, excluding Nissan, which has not given a forecast. The U.S. raised tariffs on Japanese vehicles to 27.5% from 2.5% in April but agreed last month to cut the rate to 15%. Goldman Sachs Japan estimates the reduction will lessen the damage by 1.6 trillion yen, but each month of delay adds roughly 100 billion yen to automakers’ burden, Nikkei reports. Mazda, which gets about one-third of its sales from the U.S., expected an 82% drop in net profit to 20 billion yen this fiscal year, assuming the lower rate would start Aug. 1. With tariffs estimated to cost 233.3 billion yen, it aims to offset the blow with 80 billion yen in cost cuts, but further delays could push it into the red. Subaru, with 70% of its sales in the U.S., forecasts a 210 billion yen hit and a 51% drop in operating profit to 200 billion yen. Nikkei Asia writes that Toyota projects the biggest loss—1.4 trillion yen—due to high U.S. sales and supplier costs. Its forecast also assumed an Aug. 1 start date. In July, Toyota raised U.S. prices by an average $270, citing “the improved performance of the vehicles rather than the tariffs.” Takanori Azuma, chief officer of Toyota’s accounting group, said there could be further hikes “if there is an appropriate time when customers can accept them.” Toyota now expects pricing changes to lift earnings by 370 billion yen, up from 250 billion, but far below the tariff impact. Price hikes carry risks. A rush of pre-hike buying may slow sales later, and higher prices could weaken competitiveness. “We continue to consider [price hikes] cautiously,” Honda CFO Eiji Fujimura said. Mitsubishi Motors, which raised prices in June, still posted a 3 billion yen operating loss in North America last quarter, with a 14.4 billion yen tariff drag. If prices can’t fully offset the duties, automakers must cut costs. Toyota expects savings, higher sales volume, and a better model mix to add 899.5 billion yen to operating profit. Japan’s lead trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said he expects the U.S. to lower the tariff rate when Washington corrects its “reciprocal” tariff order. Asked when, he said the two sides “tacitly share an understanding that it'd be best to do it quickly.” Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 15:45",

    "fullContent": "California Moves Forward With Special Redistricting Election To Counter Texas's Plan Authored by Aldgra Fredly via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Friday that the state will move forward with a ballot measure in November to redraw its congressional map in response to a Republican-backed redistricting plan in Texas. Accompanied by California and Texas lawmakers, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (C) discusses the push to schedule a special election to redraw California's Congressional voting districts, during a news conference in Sacramento, Calif., on Aug. 8, 2025. Rich Pedroncelli/AP Photo Speaking alongside state Democratic leaders, Newsom said they would call for a special election in the first week of November to vote on redrawing the congressional map, a move that could potentially add five more U.S. House seats to the Democratic tally. “We are talking about emergency measures to respond to what’s happening in Texas, and we will nullify what happens in Texas,” the Democratic governor told reporters. “We will pick up five seats with the consent of the people, and that’s the difference between the approach we’re taking and the approach they’re taking. We’re doing it [on a] temporary basis,” he added. Newsom also reaffirmed that the state will remain committed to its independent redistricting process. The Democrats said they expected to have a newly agreed-upon map, based on previous plans reviewed by the state’s independent redistricting commission, ready for public scrutiny next week, three months before it would go to voters. Former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who attended the conference, backed Newsom’s decision and praised Texas Democratic lawmakers for their efforts to block the GOP’s redistricting plan. “It’s not wrong in what we’re doing. This is self-defense for our democracy,” Pelosi said. “I thank again our Texans for their leadership, for their courage, and most of all, for their patriotism.” Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) speaks in support of the Texas Democratic lawmakers for their walkout to block a vote on a congressional redistricting plan sought by President Donald Trump, during a news conference in Sacramento, Calif., on Aug. 8, 2025. Rich Pedroncelli/AP Photo The move came as Texas Republicans drew a new congressional map aimed at flipping five Democratic seats in the November 2026 midterm election, prompting more than 50 Texas Democratic lawmakers to leave the state and break quorum in a bid to block the map from moving forward. Abbott added redrawing the congressional map onto the special session agenda after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sent the Texas governor a letter on July 7 raising concerns that four congressional districts in the Houston and Dallas areas were unconstitutional because of “racial gerrymandering.” Current boundaries run afoul of the Voting Rights Act by relying on racial demographics to group minority voters into “coalition districts,” where no single racial group forms a majority, according to the DOJ. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) stated on X that Democratic lawmakers still refused to appear for the Aug. 8 quorum deadline. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit with the Texas Supreme Court later that day seeking a declaration that the seats of 13 absent Democratic lawmakers were unlawfully vacant. Paxton said Texas law gives him the authority to represent the state in “quo warranto actions” and to appear before the Texas Supreme Court in matters of direct state interest. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the Texas Department of Public Safety, along with the FBI, is tracking down Democratic lawmakers who left the state, and they will be brought to the Texas Capitol. “Those who received benefits for skipping a vote face removal from office and potential bribery charges. In Texas, there are consequences for your actions,” he stated on X. Abbott also filed a lawsuit on Aug. 5 seeking the removal of state Rep. Gene Wu, who chairs the Texas House Democratic Caucus, accusing him of leading the lawmakers to break quorum and abandoning office. Wu has said that he intends to fight for his constituents. Texas Rep. Gene Wu speaks in front of Democratic members of Congress and Texas House Democrats during a news conference, after they left their state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to redraw the state's 38 congressional districts, at IBEW Local Union 701 in Warrenville, Ill., on Aug. 4, 2025. Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images In response to Newsom’s earlier comments saying he intends to temporarily bypass California’s independent redistricting commission and hold a special election in November, U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) on Aug. 5 proposed to ban mid-decade redistricting at the federal level, accusing the governor of “tricking voters to abolish the Redistricting Commission.” “Gerrymandering is a problem regardless of which party does it, and it certainly shouldn’t be done in the middle of the decade,” Kiley posted on X Aug. 6. “But what Gavin Newsom is attempting in California goes beyond that.” Kiley’s legislation, if passed, would also put the brakes on Texas Republicans’ plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts. In response to the bill, Newsom said that he supports the state’s independent redistricting commission and that any redistricting actions in California would be contingent on Texas’s decisions. “I’m appreciative that this member of Congress is waking up to the realities, what has occurred in Texas,” Newsom said during a press conference Aug. 5. “I haven’t heard much from him as it relates to the condemnation of their efforts, but I’m grateful that he recognizes the importance of a national framework.” Darlene McCormick Sanchez, Jill McLaughlin, and Reuters contributed to this report.

    "fullContent": "White House Mulls Inviting Zelensky To Trump-Putin Talks In Alaska The White House is weighing the possibility of inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Alaska for Friday's summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, several sources in the Trump administration have told media oulets. \"It’s under discussion,\" a person briefed on the matter told NBC. This despite Puting having repeatedly said it would be too early for him to meet with the Ukrainain leader, and that he'd only do so to sign a final peace settlement to end the war. Russian Orthodox Church on Alaskan coast, file image The Kremlin has made clear that the warring sides are nowhere near that point, and has even questioned the legla legitimacy of Zelensky's tenure in office far past the canceled elections. No plans have been finalized, and it's as yet unlcear whether Zelensky will actually travel to Alaska for talks. Yet a senior US official has said idea is \"absolutely\" still on the table. \"Everyone is very hopeful it will happen,\" the official added. And yet it could cause Putin to get cold feet if he senses undue pressure in this regard. Putin is unlikley to want to be in the same room, or even the same venue as talks proceed. Zelensky made clear on Saturday that he's unwilling to make a key compromise demanded of Russia. I welcome the upcoming meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Russia’s President Putin being held here in the great state of Alaska. Alaska is the most strategic location in the world, sitting at the crossroads of North America and Asia, with the Arctic to our north and… — Governor Mike Dunleavy (@GovDunleavy) August 8, 2025 Zelensky firmly declared that Ukrainians \"will not give their land to occupiers\" and that nothing can be decided in this regard without direct representation and input from Kiev. He was very clear on this point: \"Any decisions made against us, any decisions made without Ukraine, are at the same time decisions against peace.\" He then clarified Ukriane's position further, \"They will bring nothing. These are dead decisions; they will never work.\" But Putin will settle for nothing less than Ukraine formally ceding the four eastern territories which have already been declared part of the Russian Federation after a referendum which Kiev rejected. These are Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Additionally, Ukriane has not issued clarification on whether it is at least ready to given up Crimea. Drone attacks have conintued to target Crimea, and other southern portions of Russia - especially targeting oil refineries and energy infrastructure... Ukraine imposes its own sanctions on the Russian oil industry after Trump let his Friday deadline lapse without action. https://t.co/0Ny7nFfU15 — Yaroslav Trofimov (@yarotrof) August 10, 2025 Yet Trump seems to think land will be central to negotiations - even though the Ukrainians, and Europeans for that matter, are clearly not on board. \"We will not reward Russia,\" Zelensky has also vowed, in line with many European leaders - who also want a seat at the table. \"We’re going to get some back, and we’re going to get some switched,\" Trump had said during a Friday event at the White House, as quoted in the NY Times. \"There’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both.\" But this is anything but clear, as the Alaska summit fast approaches.
