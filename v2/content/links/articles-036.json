    "fullContent": "86% Of Americans Feel Stressed About The Cost Of Groceries Authored by Michael Snyder via TheMostImportantNews.com, Why are social media platforms filled with videos of Americans complaining about grocery prices right now? Needless to say, those videos must be striking a chord, because some of them are receiving millions of views. Government bureaucrats are telling us that the cost of food is only going up a few percentage points per year, but we can all see that is a load of nonsense. A trip to the grocery store has become an enormous expense, and this is especially true if you have kids to feed. As I wrote about earlier this month, one survey found that in 25 percent of U.S. households at least one person is skipping meals so that there will be enough money to pay the bills. Sadly, we are being warned that the cost of groceries will go even higher in the months ahead. Several years ago, I kept warning my readers over and over again that soon the cost of groceries would become very painful. Without a doubt, that time has arrived. According to a recent AP poll, the cost of groceries is a “source of stress” for 86 percent of U.S. adults… Does your run to the supermarket cause a spike in your blood pressure? You’re in good company. The overwhelming majority of Americans – 86% – say the cost of groceries is at least a minor source of stress. The number includes 53% who say it’s a major source of anxiety in their lives right now. That’s according to a new Associated Press/NORC poll. Those are very alarming numbers. But this is the world that we live in now. And this is why we are seeing so many videos on social media about grocery prices. Someone put together a compilation of some of the best videos where people are really flipping out emotionally… In my entire lifetime, I have never seen it so bad. At one grocery store in Chicago, one woman admitted that it feels like “you’re spending your soul on groceries”… At a South Loop grocery store, customers experience sticker shock and frustration. “No matter if it’s organic or if it’s regular, it’s still going to be an arm and a leg for it. It’s like you’re spending your soul on groceries,” said shopper Tria Hutson. This is one of the reasons why I get so frustrated with the talking heads on television that are telling us that everything is fine. Just look around you. People are hurting. Some companies are trying to hide their price hikes by keeping the prices the same but putting less stuff in each package. This is known as “shinkflation”, and Jim Quinn recently shared a personal anecdote from his own life… I think a personal anecdote I’ve experienced will show you the devious methods corporations will use to pass these tariffs along. I have been buying a pack of coated paper plates at Wal-Mart for years. The pack contained 70 paper plates. Within the last four months, the pack was reduced to 50 plates, for the same price. They know the average dolt, after years of government schooling, is deficient in math skills, so they would not realize they just experienced a 40% increase in price per plate. This will show up nowhere in the fake BLS numbers. Shrinkflation is just as bad as inflation, but they can hide it and pretend all is well, while maintaining their profits. I am sure that you are running into the same thing. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning. How can I be so confident in saying that? Let me give you just one example. Approximately two-thirds of U.S. adults drink coffee, and approximately one-third of all the coffee we drink comes from Brazil. Thanks to the 50 percent tariff that was just placed on imports from Brazil, coffee is about to become a lot more expensive… The U.S. relies heavily on Brazil to import coffee for the 165 million people who need their daily caffeine fix, but Trump’s 50 percent tariff threatens the long-term availability and price of the drink. “When people go to their local coffee shop, whether it’s Starbucks or something else, by and large they will likely be buying some form of Brazilian coffee,” Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told NPR. “A 50 percent tariff will kill that market.” I still remember the days when you could get a cup of coffee for 10 cents. What did your latest cup of coffee cost you? Of course everything else is becoming more expensive too, and our cost of living crisis never seems to end. As a result, 62 percent of Gen Z Americans have no emergency savings at all… 62% of Gen Z have no emergency savings, nearly double the rate of baby boomers. 51% of Americans would use a credit card for a $500 emergency, with usage jumping to 70% among students. Two-thirds of consumers have six months or less in savings, with Gen X the least prepared. 76% lack a credit card set aside for emergencies, relying instead on everyday-use cards. Most of the country is living on the edge financially. The middle class is steadily shrinking, and those that remain in the middle class have much less discretionary income than they once did. So restaurants all over the nation find themselves torn between rapidly rising costs and customers that now have a lot less money to spend… Ike’s Chili in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has been around for 117 years, surviving a myriad of challenges like the Great Depression, the Covid-19 pandemic and a once-in-a-generation burst of inflation. But 2025 already holds an even more complicated challenge. “The cost of everything’s just going up, and we’ve got to figure out how to manage it right,” Len Wade, a managing partner at the restaurant, told CNN. He pointed to surging beef prices as an example, specifically hamburger meat on the wholesale level. In July, those prices were up nearly 21% compared to the same month 10 years ago, federal data shows. And passing the buck to customers might not be the best solution, Wade said. Tourist destinations from coast to coast are experiencing the same thing. Las Vegas is getting far less tourist traffic than it once did, and those that do arrive are tipping a lot less… Las Vegas servers say they’re feeling the heat as high prices and declining tourism hammer their tip earnings across the Strip. Tipping in Sin City is reportedly down by as much as 50% among servers, as some of them blame the economy and policy while others point to high prices, a tipping backlash and poor service. On Reddit’s r/VegasLocals forum, one cocktail waitress wrote, “I used to average about 80 cents a drink. Now I’m averaging about 10 cents.” Nobody can deny what is happening. We really are experiencing a very serious economic crisis. Sticking our heads in the sand and pretending that everything is okay is not going to fix anything. Our standard of living really is collapsing, and a lot more pain is ahead as our economic bubbles continue to burst. We were warned that this storm was coming for a long time, and now it is here.

    "fullContent": "Commerce Department Threatens To Take Ownership Of Harvard Patents The federal government is looking into Harvard University’s patent rights, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an Aug. 8 letter to Harvard President Alan Garber. The Department of Commerce is initiating a “march-in” process under the Bayh-Dole Act, a federal patent policy allowing recipients of federal funds to retain patent rights over their inventions made with federal funding. The Act’s “march-in” rights, however, give the federal government the authority to grant licenses of such patents to third parties under certain conditions where federally funded inventions are not being adequately developed or utilized for the public good. In the letter, Lutnick said that Harvard has “failed to live up to its obligations to the American taxpayer and is in breach of the statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements tied to Harvard’s federally funded research programs and intellectual property arising therefrom, including patents.” As a result, Naveen Athrappully reports for The Epoch Times that the Department of Commerce is initiating a comprehensive review of the institution’s non-compliance, and will initiate the Bayh-Dole Act “march-in” process through which Harvard’s federally-funded patents could be taken over by the government. Lutnick said that the federal government intends to license Harvard’s patents to third parties. March-in rights under the Bayh-Dole Act have not been exercised by any federal agency in the 40 years since its enactment. In an emailed statement to The Epoch Times, a Harvard spokesperson said, “This unprecedented action is yet another retaliatory effort targeting Harvard for defending its rights and freedom. Technologies and patents developed at Harvard are life-saving and industry-redefining. “We are fully committed to complying with the Bayh-Dole Act and ensuring that the public is able to access and benefit from the many innovations that arise out of federally funded research at Harvard.” This is the latest escalation in a series of government actions taken against Harvard since Trump took office. The federal government has accused Harvard of anti-Semitism, non-disclosure related to foreign funding, and race-based discrimination. According to Harvard’s website, the university held over 5,800 patents as of July 1, 2024, and had more than 900 active technology licenses with 650-plus industry partners. The administration values the groundbreaking scientific advancements that come from the federal government’s partnership with institutions like Harvard, which are funded by “significant taxpayer dollars,” said the letter. “However, this privilege carries with it critical responsibility for Harvard to ensure that intellectual property derived from federal funding aligns with the Bayh-Dole Act, its associated regulations, and our contractual agreements, thereby maximizing the benefits to the American public,” it said. With regards to patents, Harvard has failed to comply with disclosure and ownership requirements under the Act; has not taken effective steps to achieve practical applications for inventions; and is not in compliance with a requirement to give preference to the U.S. domestic industry, the letter added. The Commerce Department’s actions are aimed at addressing these failures, Lutnick wrote. The letter asked Harvard to provide a comprehensive list of all patents it received from federally funded research grants by no later than Sept. 5. The university must also provide sufficient information to prove that it was in compliance with the Bayh-Dole Act. “Taxpayers deserve the benefit of the bargain. If Harvard won’t honor the Bayh-Dole Act, then we will find someone who will,” Lutnick said in an Aug. 8 X post, sharing the letter. Trump-Harvard Tensions Thus far, the federal government has canceled over $2.6 billion in federal funding to Harvard, including a cancellation of $2.2 billion in federal grants after the government accused the university of failing to combat anti-Semitism on campus. “Harvard’s leadership has created an unsafe campus environment by permitting anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators to harass and physically assault individuals, including many Jewish students, and otherwise obstruct its once-venerable learning environment. Many of these agitators are foreign students,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a May 22 statement. Harvard had sued the federal government on May 23 over the funding freeze, with both facing off in court in a July 21 hearing. The case is ongoing. The university argued in the lawsuit that the funding freeze was a “blatant violation” of the Due Process Clause, First Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act. “It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government’s demands to control Harvard’s governance, curriculum, and the ‘ideology’ of its faculty and students,” the lawsuit said. Harvard also highlighted that it has taken steps to combat anti-Semitism. It admitted that members of Jewish and Israeli communities have reported “vicious and reprehensible” treatment following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack against Israel. “Harvard made substantial changes aimed at ensuring its campus is safe, fair, and welcoming to Jewish and Israeli students,” said the complaint. “Harvard has adopted new accountability procedures and clarified policies; imposed meaningful discipline for those who have violated applicable policies; enhanced programs designed to address bias and promote ideological diversity and civil discourse; hired staff to support these programs and impacted students; and enhanced safety and security measures.” Meanwhile, the university is showing signs that it may be aligning with the federal government’s demands. On July 29, Harvard said that it would hand over employment forms of thousands of its staff members following a request from the DHS. The form, Employment Eligibility Verification, is used to verify the identity and employment authorization of an individual who is hired to work in the United States. The processing of the form is managed by the DHS’s Citizenship and Immigration Services. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 13:45",
