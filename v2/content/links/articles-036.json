    "summary": "- by New Deal democratNew economic data will resume tomorrow. Since I haven’t updated the impact of Tariff-palooza! on transport and spending in awhile, let’s take a look at that.The “tip of the spear” is container shipping. Here’s a graph of traffic at the busiest ports in the US, from CNBC:At the busiest ports, the steep decline this spring after a period of front-running is evident. In the past few weeks, there has been a rebound, doubtless in part caused by the TACO delay in tariff implementation. With the current “Liberation Day 2.0” set for August 1, a similar dynamic may well be in play.Once containers arrive in the US, they are typically shipped long distances by rail. Here is the historical record of monthly intermodal volumes through June, measured YoY to deal with seasonality:Again, the slowdown this spring is apparent.Here is a weekly close-up of the past year:Much like shipping traffic, there has been a rebound so far in July, which may very well represent front-running th",

    "summary": "PremiaLab Research has issued a new paper titled \"Navigating Market Shifts with QIS Trend and Momentum Strategies,\" which analyzes trend and momentum behavior in 2025 and the last five years using their pure factor models. First, trend-following has not performed well across all major asset classes; however, an equity cross-sectional momentum approach did very well. The directional changes associated with the high uncertainty in 20205 have hurt those following trends. Trend-following is a pure directional strategy, while a momentum strategy focuses on relative movement to create a long/short portfolio.Over the longer term, equity momentum continues to perform well, but there were also substantial gains focused on short-term interest rates. Clearly, there are no exploitable trends in all assets, and the secret to good trend-following is to balance exposures across all asset classes.",

    "summary": "Imagine going to the doctor and getting the exact same treatment as the person who came before you, regardless of your symptoms. The same medication. The same dosage. The same advice. It would be dangerous at worst and malpractice at best. Unfortunately, this is how most financial advice is given today. We get one-size-fits-all solutions that don't consider where you are on your financial journey or where you want to end up in the future. But this isn't the right way to approach your money. Your financial strategy should evolve as you build wealth and your needs change. This is the big idea behind The Wealth Ladder: Proven Strategies for Every Step of Your Financial Life, which is officially out today! You can find it on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kindle, Audible (narrated by me), and everywhere else books are sold: Instead of providing a singular solution to your money problems, The Wealth Ladder provides the right strategy based on your financial starting point and desired destination.

    "summary": "This paper studies how firms’ ownership choices and workers’ intrinsic motivation jointly shape service quality and market outcomes in labor-intensive, mission-driven sectors. Two organizations first choose whether to operate as standard for-profit or as mission-oriented firms, and then compete in both the labor and the user markets. Mission-oriented firms have higher unit costs but attract better-motivated workers. Service quality is endogenously determined through the sorting of intrinsically motivated workers and depends on the firm's ownership type. We show that all market structures — standard, mission-oriented, or mixed — can arise in equilibrium, and that mixed structures can be Pareto superior by efficiently allocating the most motivated workers to the mission-oriented firm while preserving the cost advantage of the other firm. While equilibrium outcomes generally diverge from the social optimum due to externalities and lack of coordination, they are both driven by the trade-of",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20479",
    "summary": "This paper explores a repositioning of Europe’s labor market institutions as potential drivers of the transatlantic gap in macroeconomic performance. Institutional diagnoses were prominent in times of high European unemployment in the 1980-90s. But interest waned as joblessness fell—even though the decline was uneven, precarious work arrangements have grown, and labor markets remain largely unreformed (unlike product and financial markets). Yet, rigid labor market institutions might continue to matter because they can stifle labor market and business dynamism: Europeans switch jobs much less frequently, and restructuring is much rarer. Recent research argues that such immobility impedes wage and productivity growth. Moreover, this low dynamism might contribute to Europe’s specific underperformance in tech, R&D, disruptive innovation, ICT adoption—where creative destruction requires fluid reallocation. This institutional labor market perspective on European competitiveness complements p",

    "summary": "We present new evidence on the impact of fiscal variables on long-term interest rates and term premia in the United States. To alleviate endogeneity problems, we follow the seminal methodology by Laubach (2009) and resort to long-term projections of interest rates and fiscal variables. After incorporating an additional 20 years of data into our sample, the estimated effects of debt and deficits on interest rates show little change from Laubach’s findings. However, we show that the link between long-term rates and fiscal variables is not stable over time. It was close to zero during the years of relative fiscal prudence around the turn of the century and it has been increasing since fiscal positions have started to deteriorate markedly",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20477",
    "summary": "This paper presents micro-empirical evidence on the effects of wage-setting decentralization. Our setting is Italy, where employers are required to comply with occupation- and industry-specific wage floors set by national collective bargaining agreements. We show that opting out of these agreements reduces wages but increases workers’ employment and retention within firms. These effects are most pronounced in the more productive North, where the overall impact on workers’ earnings is slightly positive. In contrast, in the South, wage losses outweigh employment gains, leading to a net decline in earnings. We also find that increased wage-setting flexibility is associated with higher firm survival rates in both regions. The regional divergence in outcomes aligns with a monopsony framework in which productivity and labor supply elasticities vary spatially.",
