    "fullContent": "Inside NATO's Efforts To Arm Ukraine Authored by RFE/RL via OilPrice.com, European NATO countries have pledged to buy American weapons, including Patriots, for Ukraine as U.S. support under Trump wanes. The EU surpassed the U.S. in total aid to Ukraine and committed to boosting defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2034. While Europe is increasing artillery shell production, Ukraine still urgently needs U.S.-made air defense systems to counter Russian strikes. Earlier in July, an agreement was reached for European NATO allies to purchase American weapons, including Patriot missiles, for Ukraine. While Germany recently announced that two Patriots would head to Kyiv shortly, questions remain if this deal really will give Ukraine what it needs in the months ahead. The deal, announced by US President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in Washington, D.C., on July 14, is essentially a continuation of what has been the modus operandi for Western allies since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine over three years ago: the Europeans send military equipment they already have to Kyiv and then replenish their stock with new weapons -- mainly American ones. The big difference now, though, is that the Europeans must considerably step up weapons deliveries to Ukraine, with the Trump administration so far not providing any new pledges. (Deliveries promised during the Biden administration are still continuing, however.) To an extent, the Europeans have ramped up production to fill the gap, with the German-based Kiel Institute noting that for the first time since June 2022, Europe has surpassed the United States in total military aid to Ukraine with 72 billion euros ($83 billion), compared to 65 billion euros coming from Washington. Increased NATO Defense Spending The question for Ukraine and its allies is how viable the proposed mechanism will be. In the long run, the Europeans will have to buy more weapons after having pledged to spend 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense by 2034 at the NATO summit in the Hague in June. Arms destined for Ukraine will be a key part of this spending. A diplomat from an EU country, speaking anonymously to RFE/RL, said the July Washington deal is the best way to keep the \"Americans engaged in Ukraine in particular and in Europe in general,\" as the United States will benefit from the expected European defense splurge. And while Europe is keen to invest in its own defense sector, this will take time. European leaders have decided it's better to buy American at least in the short term. \"It's either that or leave Ukraine without weapons,\" one NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity as they aren't authorized to speak on the record, told RFE/RL. \"I think on the European side there is a hard realization that this has to happen in some fashion or another.\" On July 21, the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, an alliance of over 50 countries including all NATO member states and several non-NATO partners, met online for the first time since the Washington deal was announced. At the meeting of the group, which has been the key coordinator of Western arms deliveries to Kyiv, as many as seven countries expressed interest in buying American weapons for Ukraine. Those countries included Canada, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and some of the Nordic nations. The outcome of the meeting of the Contact Group, which is also known as the Ramstein group, is that Ukraine would provide a detailed \"wish list\" of what it needs, focusing in particular on air defense and ammunition. NATO, in turn, would provide an estimate of how much such military hardware would cost to purchase. More clarity is expected when the Ramstein group assembles again in the fall, possibly in Ukraine for the first time. The main question now is how quickly the military hardware can be delivered to Ukraine. European countries are expected to supply 2 million 155-millimeter artillery shells this year, and with Ukraine beginning domestic production supported by Western funding, the gap caused by the absence of American exports could be covered. Patriots In Demand But with air defense, it's a different story. And it's here that Ukraine still needs American arms, notably Patriot surface-to-air missiles. The European alternative to the Patriot missile defense system, the French-Italian SAMP-T, has been provided to Kyiv, with Rome recently announcing a third battery will be sent in the fall. But according to NATO diplomats, producing both the interceptors required and the entire setup takes longer compared to the Patriots. Plus, Kyiv has also questioned the European system's effectiveness. When Trump and Rutte met the press to announce the deal on July 14, the US president mentioned that 17 Patriot systems could be readied to be purchased for Ukraine. Germany last week announced that it will send two batteries to Ukraine in the near future, but it is not clear where the other systems would come from. Six European countries -- Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and Spain -- currently operate Patriot systems, but there are fears from those countries that sharing their batteries with Ukraine would leave their own skies exposed. Both Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, the two primary producers of Patriots, are stepping up production to meet the European demands, but Ukraine, under constant Russian barrage, will likely not see the benefits anytime soon.

    "fullContent": "'DEATH TO THE IDF': American Who Invaded Gaza Has Cars Torched In St Louis Attack Police in suburban St. Louis are investigating an arson and graffiti attack that targeted vehicles at the home of US citizen who served in the Israel Defense Forces. As police search for a lone-wolf perpetrator who left anti-IDF graffiti next to the burning vehicles, various public officials, organizations and media outlets rushed to describe the wrongdoing as an \"antisemitic hate crime,\" fueling ongoing debates about the definition of antisemitism and the problematic concept of \"hate crimes\" in general. Graffiti accompanied an arson attack on vehicles at the home of a US citizen who recently served in the Israel Defense Forces (First Alert 4) The attack took place in the western suburb of Clayton at around 3am on Tuesday, leaving three cars heavily damaged after an unspecified means was used to set them ablaze. The arson was accompanied by graffiti sprayed on the street. St. Louis station First Alert 4 shared a drone-acquired image of one of two messages: \"DEATH TO THE IDF.\" The outlet chose to blur the other message, saying it was \"targeted at a specific individual.\" However, in an X post condemning the attack, Leo Terrell, Chairman of the DOJ Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, said the graffiti \"accused him of being a murderer.\" BREAKING: 🇮🇱🇺🇲 An Israeli soldier with US citizenship was attacked in Clayton, Missouri, his vehicles were set on fire and destroyed. Graffiti outside the family’s home called for death to the IDF. pic.twitter.com/ZBOe3MRL6q — Megatron (@Megatron_ron) August 6, 2025 There were no injuries and, as this story is written, the IDF soldier has not been identified. Police sources told First Alert 4 they believe the attack was carried out by a single individual, but apparently have no suspect yet. They've asked the FBI and St. Louis Regional Bomb and Arson Unit to help with the investigation, and are soliciting tips from the public. By all indications, this Clayton, Missouri resident was targeted because he recently served in the IDF as that organization carried out a widely-condemned campaign in Gaza characterized by a massive civilian death toll, the deprivation of food and medicine, the purposeful and vast destruction of residences, schools, hospitals, farms and other civilian architecture, and explicit ambitions of ethnic cleansing voiced by senior Israeli cabinet ministers. That's certainly not to justify the violation of the victim's property rights, only to rationally explore the question of the criminal's motive. “This landscape of destruction looks otherworldly. Yet it’s not. It is this world. And what is happening may yet come to define one of its darkest eras. One that casts a stain on humanity that will endure for generations.” — ITV News, with aerial footage of Gaza. pic.twitter.com/nzHDVG2LxK — Drop Site (@DropSiteNews) August 4, 2025 Despite himself highlighting that the attacker wrote \"Death to the IDF\" and accused the victim of being a murderer, the DOJ's Terrell raced to describe the incident as \"a horrific antisemitic attack\" that \"has no place in America.\" Separately, he told JNS, \"What I saw in the graphic videos [of burned cars], I saw hate. I saw hate because of one’s religion.\" The Fox News' headline likewise called it an \"antisemitic attack,\" and the Jewish Federation of St. Louis broadly interpreted the arson and anti-IDF vandalism as an \"attack on members of our community.\" On the other hand, Assistant US Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon judiciously chose to refer to the villain's messaging as only \"alleged antisemitic vandalism.\" The Anti-Defamation League's Jordan Kadosh linked the attack to a controversial slogan used by some pro-Palestine activists: “When you hear somebody say 'Globalize the Intifada,' this is what it looks like. It looks like burned out cars on suburban streets on America. This is not confined. When somebody says they want to take this fight to Jews around the world they mean everywhere.” Though the victim hasn't been identified yet, police say the crime occurred in the 7500 block of Westmoreland Avenue in Clayton. Various property-search sites show that one of the homes on this block is owned by the parents of Myles Rosenblum, who moved to Israel immediately after graduating from Tulane University in 2023. He returned to St. Louis earlier this year after serving two years with the IDF, most recently in the Paratroopers Unit 101. He hasn't shied away from publicity, granting multiple interviews to the STL Jewish Light and performing a public speaking engagement on his experience in IDF invasions of both Gaza and Lebanon. “There is nothing I’d rather be doing with my life right now, more than serving the country of Israel,\" he said in October 2023, days after the Oct 7 Hamas invasion. One of three cars destroyed or damaged in the attack carried out around 3am on Tuesday Police are already calling the incident a hate crime, referring to a class of crimes where wrongdoing is motivated by bias against the victim's membership in some class defined by characteristics such as race, color, religion or sexual orientation. Critics of the hate-crime concept question why motive should be a crime unto itself, particularly when it's an inherently murky legal question -- as would be the case with this St. Louis incident. Other critics point to the arbitrary designations of protected classes. As Michael Conklin wrote at the George Mason Law Review, \"The Atlanta spa shootings further illustrate this principle. Since the evidence indicates [Robert] Long targeted his victims based on their working profession at a spa, it is not a hate crime. But if he had targeted these same people because they were Asian, it would have been a hate crime. It is unclear why the former deserves a less harsh punishment than the latter.\" While the alleged hate-crime element in St Louis may eventually have to be proven in court, it's safe to assume the ADL has already added the attack to its controversial database of antisemitic incidents. The ADL been criticized for using an expansive definition of antisemitism that results in the mere use of the phrase \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" -- or mere opposition to the political ideology of Zionism -- as antisemitic incidents.
