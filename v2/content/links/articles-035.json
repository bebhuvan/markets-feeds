    "fullContent": "Latest Global Nuclear Project Snapshot Shows China Still Dominates Nuclear has been a core investment theme since December 2020, followed by the launch of \"The Next AI Trade\" in April 2024 and the introduction of the \"Powering Up America\" theme shortly thereafter. We expanded our nuclear coverage yesterday as Goldman initiated bullish coverage on Uranium Energy Corp. As a reminder, we first flagged Cameco Corp. as a buy around $9 a share; it's now trading above $78. Goldman's latest nuclear reactor tracker, which charts out global project progress, underscores that a new era of atomic energy is set to come online to help power all things AI in the 2030s. New reactor progress and announcements: North America 7/18/2025 - United States - At an energy summit in Pittsburgh PA, Westinghouse announced plans to start construction of the first of 10 new AP1000 reactors in the US by 2030 (here). 7/29/2025 - United States - The US NRC has approved licensing for the 800MW restart of Palisades Nuclear Plant. Holtec expects the plant to be restarted in the fourth quarter of 2025 (here). 8/7/2025 - United States - The DOE approved the 5th loan disbursement to Holtec to help fund the restart the Palisades Nuclear Plant. The 5th disbursement was for ~$82mn and the loan guarantee to Holtec is for \"up to $1.52bn.\" To date, ~$335mn has been disbursed (here). Europe 7/7/2025 - Belgium - Restart and extended operation of Belgian reactors approved. The Federal Agency for Nuclear Control has approved the restart of unit 3 at Tihange nuclear power plant following a maintenance outage. Doel 4 is scheduled to restart by November 2025 at the latest. Doel 4 and Tihange 2 were the country's last 2 reactors which were scheduled to close in 2025 (here). 7/18/2025 - Bulgaria - Bulgaria partners with Citi for financing of new Kozloduy units. The construction of Units 7 and 8 will be the first reactors in Europe using Westinghouse's AP1000 technology. The goal is to have Unit 7 operational by 2035 and Unit 8 operational by 2038 (here). 7/22/2025 - United Kingdom - UK Energy Secretary signed a FID for Sizewell C nuclear power plant in England. The government confirmed it will take a 44.9% stake in the project. The plan for Sizewill C is to build 2 EPR reactors producing a total of 3.2GW of electricity for at least 60 years. This is set to be the first new nuclear construction project in the UK in decades (here). 7/29/2025 - Slovakia - Slovakia has moved forward with plans to build a nuclear plant (costs estimated at €13-15bn) in partnership with the US company Westinghouse. The intergovernmental deal signed with the US has already been finalized however the deal does not technically oblige Slovakia to choose Westinghouse. A construction contract is expected in 2027, pending feasibility studies (here). Asia 7/22/2025 - Japan - Japan is reportedly conducting surveys for its first nuclear power plant location since Fukushima incident (here). 8/1/2025 - Kazakhstan - China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has now secured a contract to lead the construction of a third nuclear facility in Kazakhstan. Earlier in the year (June 2025) Russia's Rosatom was selected to build the first nuclear facility in Kazakhstan while CNNC has been selected to build the second and third facility (here). 8/7/2025 - India - India laid out key features of its nuclear energy strategy with the goal of achieving 100GW of nuclear capacity by 2047. The government noted Gorakhpur 1 and 2 are expected to be completed by 2031-2032. The government describes these as under construction, however the PRIS database does not consider these as under construction until the first major placing of concrete (here). 8/8/2025 - China - The China National Nuclear Safety Administration issued a construction license on Friday, August 8th for units 1 and 2 at the Jinqimen nuclear power plant. The construction of the two, Hualong One reactors, was approved on December 29th, 2023 with the ground breaking ceremony held in February 2024. The current license now allows first concrete to be poured for the foundation of the reactor (here). Latest reactors connected to power grids. China dominates the reactor pipeline. Global reactors under construction (years under construction). Chinese reactors under construction (years under construction). A separate Goldman note outlines that the coming uranium supply deficit is set to explode.

    "fullContent": "Over 20,000 Arrested In Iran On Suspicion Of Espionage During War With Israel Via The Cradle Iranian police arrested around 21,000 people on various charges during the 12-day war with Israel, Iran's national police force reported on Tuesday. According to local media, more than 7,850 public tips were received during the fighting, leading to the arrests. The spokesperson of the Iranian police, Saed Montazer al-Mahdi, noted that the Iranian Cyber Police (FATA) handled 5,700 cybercrime cases, including internet fraud, unauthorized withdrawals, and a cyber attack on the Nobitex exchange. Via Associated Press He said 2,774 “illegal citizens” were detained, with 261 people arrested on suspicion of espionage and 172 detained for unauthorized filming – some for filming “sensitive centers” around the country. Examinations of the suspects' mobile phones led to the opening of 30 special security cases. Speaking on the Evin Prison incident, Mahdi stated that police arrested 127 “security and political” inmates during an escape attempt, including two of whom were dressed in firefighter uniforms. Fars News Agency reported on July 25 that more than 700 people had been detained over the previous 12 days on charges of “security cooperation with Israel.” Separately, judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir said on 22 July that 75 prisoners escaped during an Israeli missile strike on Evin Prison. According to Shargh Media Group, Iranian Minister of Intelligence Ismail Khatib said, “The intelligence and security organizations have the resources [personnel, assets, and operational capabilities] to mobilize them both internally and within the regime itself. During the imposed 12-day war, we witnessed seven million public reports.” He added, “We hope that as this unity has been the axis of destroying all influence, hostility, conspiracy, and sedition, we will all be able to protect this unity and cohesion.” During the June war, Israel launched coordinated attacks inside Iran, killing senior military and intelligence officials, nuclear scientists, and striking key military sites and administrative infrastructure. Analysts speculate that the purpose of striking administrative buildings and infrastructure is to weaken the Iranian government's grip and control over its border provinces with the hope of seeding unrest and separatist movements. Both during and after the war, Iranian security forces seized large caches of explosives, drones, and weapons, along with workshops used for manufacturing unmanned systems from within the country itself. Since then, the hunt for infiltrating agents has continued across the country, with leaders urging citizens to “maintain their vigilance, as they showed during the war.” Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 22:35",
