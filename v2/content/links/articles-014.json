    "summary": "Never-Before-Seen Photos Inside Jeffrey Epstein's Creepy Mansion div property=\"schema:text\" class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-w.",
    "fullContent": "Never-Before-Seen Photos Inside Jeffrey Epstein's Creepy Mansion The New York Times published never-before-seen photos from inside Jeffrey Epstein's erie seven-story Upper East Side townhouse on Tuesday, revealing surveillance cameras placed in bedrooms and a first edition of \"Lolita\" prominently displayed throughout the New York City mansion. Among the bizarre scenes is a macabre sculpture of a woman in a bridal gown dangling from a rope greeting visitors in the entryway, alongside dozens of framed fake eyeballs in a display that raises serious questions about what really went on behind closed doors. A copy of “Lolita,” the 1955 novel where a deviant repeatedly rapes a 12-year-old girl with whom he has become obsessed, was also spotted in an office. Among Epstein’s possessions was a first edition of Vladimir Nabokov’s novel “Lolita” — in which the main character rapes a 12-year-old girl with whom he has become obsessed. SDNY However, the most eyebrow-raising photo is a $1 bill bearing a handwritten note from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. \"I was wrong!\" Gates appeared to have scrawled on the note. Epstein's residence was also adorned with framed photographs featuring prominent figures such as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Pope John Paul II, Richard Branson, Elon Musk, and others, according to the Times. Another flight up, on the third floor, was Mr. Epstein’s sanctum — a suite that included his bedroom, the mansion’s infamous massage room and a cluster of bathrooms. More via the Times: As a gift for Jeffrey Epstein’s 63rd birthday, friends sent letters in tribute to the wealthy financier and convicted sex offender. Several shared a common theme: recounting the dinner gatherings that Mr. Epstein regularly hosted at his palatial townhouse on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Ehud Barak, former prime minister of Israel, and his wife noted the great diversity of guests. “There is no limit to your curiosity,” they wrote in their message, which was compiled with others in January 2016. “You are like a closed book to many of them but you know everything about everyone.” The media mogul Mortimer Zuckerman suggested ingredients for a meal that would reflect the culture of the mansion: a simple salad and whatever else “would enhance Jeffrey’s sexual performance.” And the director Woody Allen described how the dinners reminded him of Dracula’s castle, “where Lugosi has three young female vampires who service the place.” The freshly published photos have slowly emerged over the years as part of the mountain of evidence that came to light when Epstein was finally arrested in 2019 on child sex-trafficking charges. The photos are the latest development in the ongoing Epstein saga, which continues to generate controversy after the Department of Justice and the FBI released a joint memo last month claiming that an \"exhaustive review\" of evidence from Epstein's death definitively ruled out murder. \"After a thorough investigation, FBI investigators concluded that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on August 10, 2019,\" the memo reads. The agencies also denied the existence of a \"client list\" tied to Epstein, directly contradicting earlier remarks by Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi had previously suggested on Fox News that such a list was \"sitting on my desk\" for review, igniting speculation about Epstein's possible blackmailing of globalist elites. A photo from 2011 shows (from left) James Staley, Lawrence Summers, Epstein, Bill Gates and Boris Nikolic at the late pedophile’s Manhattan home. Trump has repeatedly sought to dismiss the scandal, accusing Democrats of fabricating a hoax around Epstein to thwart his agenda. Additionally, new questions have emerged about surveillance footage from the night before Epstein's death. An unidentified orange object seen in the surveillance video near the jail cell of deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein on the evening before his death has prompted a flurry of questions from forensic experts. The pixelated shape, first witnessed by CBS News, is seen shifting towards Epstein's cell block at the Metropolitan Correctional Center around 10:40 p.m.The object was a corrections officer \"carrying linen or inmate clothing,\" according to federal investigators. However, experts told CBS News that it could in fact be an inmate wearing a jumpsuit. \"Based on the limited video, it's more likely a person in an [orange] uniform,\" Conor McCourt, forensic video expert, said in a statement. \"To say that there's no way that someone could get to that, the stairs up to his room, without being seen is false,\" Jim Safford, another forensic expert, told the news network. Epstein was discovered deceased in his cell on August 10, 2019. An official autopsy, corroborated by a joint investigation from the Department of Justice and FBI, concluded that the disgraced financier died by suicide through hanging. Epstein’s home office featured a taxidermied tiger. In a statement to CBS News, the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General said the footage does not change its conclusion on Epstein's death. \"Our comprehensive assessment of the circumstances over the weeks, days, and hours before Epstein's death included the effects of the longstanding, chronic staffing crisis in the [Bureau of Prisons] and the BOP's failure to provide and maintain quality camera coverage within its facilities,\" the statement to the outlet read.

    "fullContent": "Taibbi: No Doubt Left... Russiagate Was A Cover-Up Authored by Matt Taibbi via Racket News, The most infuriatingly complex scandal of all time has just been reduced to a page or two, thanks to another declassified release... It was a cover-up. The Russiagate scandal has long been one of the most convoluted, hard-to-follow news stories of all time. It even has multiple names thanks to its peculiar chronology. From 2016 until April 2019 — while Democrats still held out hope of “presidency-wrecking” revelations that would topple Donald Trump — it was generally known as the Trump-Russia scandal. After Special Counsel Robert Mueller broke the hearts of MSNBC audiences by issuing a report without new indictments, attention began to be cast on the scandal’s fraudulent construction, how it was propped up by political spying, illegal leaks, and WMD-style intelligence fakery. Trump and others began to call it Spygate or the Russia hoax, but the name that stuck was Russiagate. Those of us who covered the story from the start had a difficult time explaining to audiences what it was, as we ourselves didn’t know. Now we do, after a month of disclosures, capped yesterday by the release of an explosive (and inexplicably long-classified) annex to the report of Special Counsel John Durham. Finally, it seems, we can explain how the idea that Donald Trump was “gaffing his way toward treason” through a secret love affair (really!) with Vladimir Putin and extensive “ties” or “links” with Russia suddenly became The Biggest Story in the World in the summer of 2016. “THE KISS”: Media outlets were promoting the “love story” as early as March 2016 It wasn’t the start of a corruption story about Trump, but the cover-up of a still-unresolved Hillary Clinton scandal. This is purely a Clinton corruption story, probably the last in a long line, as neither Bill nor Hillary will have careers when it’s finished, if they stay out of jail. Characteristically, the most powerful political family since the Kennedys won’t just bring many individuals down with them, but whole institutions, as the FBI, the CIA, the presidency of Barack Obama, and a dozen or so of the most celebrated brands in commercial media will see their names blackened forever through association with this idiotic caper. A fair number of those media companies should (and likely will) go out of business. Now, we know. With the help of the declassified Durham material, we can explain the whole affair in three brushstrokes. One, Hillary Clinton and her team apparently hoped to deflect from her email scandal and other problems via a campaign tying Trump to Putin. Two, American security services learned of these plans. Three — and this is the most important part — instead of outing them, authorities used state resources to massively expand and amplify her scheme. The last stage required the enthusiastic cooperation and canine incuriosity of the entire commercial news business, which cheered as conspirators made an enforcement target of Trump, actually an irrelevant bystander. I’ve tiptoed for years around what I believed to be true about this case, worrying some mitigating fact might emerge. Now, there’s no doubt. Hillary Clinton got in a jam, and the FBI, CIA, and the Obama White House got her out of it by setting Trump up. That’s it. It was a cover-up, plain and simple... ... These people just can’t stop lying. The whole thing is one endless lie, the reason for which is now clear. Hillary Clinton got in trouble being dumb, tried to save herself by doing something dumber, and all of American officialdom backed the play. That’s it. A last period of denials awaits, but they’ll fizzle like the rest, after which not much will be left but blunt truth — and hopefully, consequences.

    "fullContent": "Waste Of The Day: Senate Furniture Is Missing Authored by Jeremy Portnoy via RealClearInvestigations, Topline: Over the last decade, more than half the Senate office furniture purchased have some unanswered question attached to them - including where the furniture is located. The Architect of the Capitol’s Senate Furniture Program “needs significant improvements,” and its “processes for acquiring, safeguarding, transferring, and disposing of furniture are inefficient and ineffective,” according to a new audit from the Architect of the Capitol’s inspector general. Key facts: The Architect is responsible for maintaining the buildings and grounds on Capitol Hill, but it typically only buys furniture for Senate office buildings. The office bought 29,603 pieces of furniture from 2014 to 2024, costing taxpayers $22.6 million. “A minimum” of 13,159 pieces of furniture (51%) have \"erroneous information,” according to the audit. Some mistakes are minor — an incorrect tag number or description — but others are much larger, including that no one knows where the furniture is, how much it cost, or both. First, auditors randomly selected a piece of furniture listed in the Architect’s computer catalog, but staffers were unable to locate it. The only clue showing the furniture’s location was a handwritten note from 2012, but the furniture was not actually at that location. Next, the auditors randomly selected another piece of furniture. Architect staffers were able to find this one, but not any documents showing its cost — they had been lost in a flood. Finally, auditors allowed Architect staffers to choose the piece of furniture that would be reviewed by the inspector general. Still, auditors found five issues with the hand-selected piece of furniture, including forms with missing signatures and conflicting dollar costs on different documents. Overall, auditors reviewed 138 pieces of furniture but were unable to locate 71 of them. The Architect leases building space to store extra furniture, but the buildings are poorly maintained and are sometimes unusable, according to the audit. The Architect is also buying too many items. There are “several dozen” microwaves in storage to eventually replace the current microwaves, but the extras may be “obsolete” before they are needed. Staffers have also been leaving furniture unattended in hallways, which will make it harder to prevent theft, according to the audit. Search all federal, state and local salaries and vendor spending with the world’s largest government spending database at OpenTheBooks.com. Summary: After the federal government’s $3.3 billion spending spree on furniture during the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s no wonder officials are having trouble keeping track of it all.

    "fullContent": "Crude Jittery As Trump Mulls New Sanctions On Russia's 'Shadow Fleet' Oil prices remain jittery today as the market digests yet another sanctions-threat targeting Russia. President Trump is said to be mulling new sanctions on Russia’s so-called \"shadow fleet\" of oil tankers if Moscow doesn't commit to a peace agreement with Ukraine by Friday. Despite many threats, the Trump White House has yet to impose new sanctions on Russia since he took office. Already the Russian economy is incredibly isolated in the West's eyes, while a growing Kremlin reliance on leading BRICS countries such as China and India has emerged. Postimees/Scanpix Baltics via Reuters Connect: On November 4, 2025, Estonian authorities detained an oil tanker that formed part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" and that had been sailing through Estonian waters in the Gulf of Finland. Both of these countries have said they don't plant to change course on Russian energy, even in the face of secondary sanctions which are being dangled by Washington. Financial Times describes that oil sales from this 'shadow fleet' has been a key source of funding for the Kremlin's war machine: The “shadow fleet” consists of ships with obscure ownership structures that avoid Western services like insurance and logistics, making it difficult to penalize the owners directly. However, recent efforts to sanction the ships themselves have shown some success. According to two individuals familiar with White House discussions, sanctions on the shadow fleet are viewed as a relatively straightforward way to increase pressure on Russia. A third source close to the administration confirmed that broader sanctions options, including targeting the fleet, are under review. There are existing Biden era sanctions on over 200 named Russian crude, chemical, and product tankers. Trump has reportedly held back on expanding these sanctions on hopes of achieving ceasefire in Ukraine. Russia has until Friday, sources cited in the FT say. \"If enacted, additional U.S. measures would reinforce similar efforts by the European Union. Last month, the EU added over 100 ships to its sanctions list, raising the total to 415.\" This has done nothing to deter Putin's 'Special Military Operation' in Ukraine. In many ways the West is out of 'solutions' as it has sanctioned Russia to unprecedented levels - and yet this has done little. The ultimate answer from Moscow's point of view remains significant territorial concessions by Kiev and a clear binding pledge to never join NATO. And yet the Zelensky government has refused.

    "fullContent": "White House Order To Punish Banks That Discriminate Against Conservatives, Crypto Companies The White House is about to unveil a new executive order that would punish big banks who discriminate against conservatives and crypto companies. A draft of the order seen by the WSJ directs bank regulators to investigate whether any financial institutions may have violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust laws, or consumer financial protection laws - with violators facing monetary penalties, consent decrees or other disciplinary measures, according to the draft. People familiar with the EO told the Journal that it could be signed as soon as this week, though the order could become delayed or the administration's plans may change. The draft order doesn’t name any specific banks but appears to refer to an instance where Bank of America was accused of shutting down the accounts of a Christian organization operating in Uganda based on the organization’s religious beliefs. The bank has said it shut down the accounts because it doesn’t serve small businesses operating outside the U.S. The draft order also criticizes the role that some banks played in an investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol. -WSJ As Cointelegraph notes, conservatives have also claimed that banks have denied them services based on political beliefs. The banking industry calls the practice “derisking,” and financial institutions have broad discretion to close accounts, whether the account holder poses a legal, financial or reputational risk to the firm. The Federal Reserve said in June that it would stop examining for reputational risk following similar moves made by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. Crypto, meanwhile, was long in the crosshairs of the Biden administration - in what industry executives have alleged was an effort to cut crypto off from the financial system by using regulators to pressure banks into backing away from clients involved in digital assets. As the outlet reports further, the reported draft order directs bank regulators to scrap any of their policies that may have contributed to banks dropping some customers, such as crypto firms. It also directs the US government’s Small Business Administration to review banking practices that guarantee the loans made by the agency to small businesses. The order asks regulators to refer some of the potential violations to the attorney general for the Department of Justice to follow up. The Journal reported in June that the White House was planning for Trump to sign a similar order aiming at stopping banks from cutting off services to industries such as crypto. “Operation Choke Point 2.0” claims Crypto executives have claimed that former President Joe Biden began to cut off their industry from banking in late 2022 after the collapse of FTX, with the crypto exchange being revealed as a massive fraud. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal testified at a Congressional hearing in February that the Biden-era Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) “bludgeoned the banks” with examinations and questions around crypto and stablecoins until they “relented under the pressure.” A Coinbase-supported Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the FDIC showed the agency asked certain financial institutions to pause crypto banking activities, which Grewal said showed the industry’s claim “wasn’t just some crypto conspiracy theory.” Crypto venture capitalist Nic Carter coined the term “Operation Choke Point 2.0” in February 2023 to describe the perceived debanking phenomenon, taking inspiration from the Justice Department’s “Operation Choke Point” against banks and payday lenders in the 2010s.

    "fullContent": "Titan Sub Implosion That Killed 5 People Was 'Preventable': Coast Guard Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times, The 2023 implosion in the Atlantic Ocean of a submersible, which killed five people, could have been prevented, the U.S. Coast Guard said in a report released on Aug. 5. The company that operated the Titan sub, OceanGate, failed to adhere to its own safety standards and did not encourage employees to raise concerns without fear of retaliation, according to the 327-page report. “Instead, the company’s systemic failures created an environment where risks were ignored, and consequences were inevitable,” it said. The report of investigation (ROI) included recommendations on improving oversight of subs, which authorities say will make the operations safer. “This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,” Jason Neubauer, chair of the Coast Guard’s Marine Board of Investigation probe into the implosion, said in a statement. “The two-year investigation has identified multiple contributing factors that led to this tragedy, providing valuable lessons learned to prevent a future occurrence. “There is a need for stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework. I am optimistic the ROI’s findings and recommendations will help improve awareness of the risks and the importance of proper oversight while still providing a pathway for innovation.” Lawyers representing OceanGate in a legal case filed by the family of one of the people who died in the implosion did not return an inquiry. OceanGate went into the sea on June 18, 2023, off the coast of Newfoundland. The implosion left all five people on board dead. For years leading up to the event, OceanGate used intimidation and the company’s reputation to evade scrutiny by regulators, according to the Coast Guard. That left it able to operate Titan “completely outside of the established deep-sea protocols,” the report said. OceanGate executives ignored crucial inspections, data analyses, and preventative maintenance, which led to the implosion, according to the report. The faulty actions included using just four bolts to secure Titan’s 3,500-pound dome to the sub despite the design calling for 18 bolts, according to the report. OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, who died in the implosion, was quoted as saying fewer bolts were used “because it took less time.” Rush cofounded OceanGate with businessman Guillermo Sohnlein, who left the company before the implosion. Sohnlein testified in the Coast Guard inquiry that the company used carbon fiber for Titan because it wanted a cheaper, lightweight material. He said he did not dive himself in Titan because he did not want to take space away from others and that Rush wanted to go himself because, he told Sohnlein, “if anything happens, I want it to impact me.” OceanGate employees also spoke to investigators. One, who served as the company’s director of engineering, said that a crack in the carbon fiber hull of Titan was covered up by Rush, who did not want to disclose it to the public and later came up with false explanations for the crack, including that a lightning strike caused it. OceanGate later fired the director. OceanGate ultimately built a new Titan using a new carbon fiber hull, but the design and construction featured flaws that weakened the structural integrity of the sub, the Coast Guard said. The implosion was caused by a loss of structural integrity of the hull, the Coast Guard determined. The people on board were exposed to nearly 5,000 pounds per square inch of water pressure, resulting in their instantaneous deaths. Tyler Durden Tue, 08/05/2025 - 15:00",
