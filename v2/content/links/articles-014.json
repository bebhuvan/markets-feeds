    "fullContent": "Trump Demands Intel CEO \"Must Resign\" Over Alleged China Ties Cited In Senator Cotton's Letter President Trump must have read U.S. Republican Senator Tom Cotton's letter, sent to Intel's Board on Wednesday, about the chipmaker's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan's ties to Chinese firms, and a recent criminal case involving his former company, Cadence Design. That's because Trump just fired off a shocking new Truth Social post moments ago. \"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform. The president continued, \"There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!\" In a letter addressed to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary, Cotton raised the question whether Intel's Board knew about subpoenas issued to Cadence during Tan's tenure, and whether Tan has fully disclosed or divested from Chinese chip firms linked to the Chinese military or Communist Party. Writing to \"express concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security\", Cotton said in the letter. Cotton noted that Tan recently pleaded guilty to illegally transferring sensitive chip design technology to a Chinese military university and semiconductor firm while working at Cadence. Cotton also criticized Intel's decision to hire Tan despite these associations, especially given the company's nearly $8 billion award under the CHIPS Act and its role in the Secure Enclave program, which requires strict compliance with national security protocols. Intel shares are down nearly 4% in premarket trading in New York. Here's the full letter from the GOP Senator: Mr. Frank D. Yeary Chairman of the Board of Directors Intel Corporation 2200 Mission College Blvd Santa Clara, CA 95054 Dear Mr. Yeary: I write to express concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security. In March 2025, Intel appointed Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO. Mr. Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Mr. Tan was most recently the CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a company that makes electronic design automation (EDA) technology, which is a key enabler of advanced chip design. Last week, Cadence pleaded guilty to illegally selling its products to a Chinese military university and transferring its technology to an associated Chinese semiconductor company without obtaining licenses. These illegal activities occurred under Mr. Tan's tenure. Intel was awarded nearly $8 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act, the largest grant to a single company. Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations. Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations. In the interest of transparency and national security, I respectfully request a response to the following questions by August 15, 2025. Was the Board aware of Cadence's subpoenas before hiring Mr. Tan as CEO? If so, what measures were taken to address concerns about Cadence's activities under Mr. Tan? Did the Board require Mr. Tan to divest from his positions in semiconductor firms linked to the Chinese Communist Party or the People's Liberation Army and any other concerning entities in China that could pose a conflict of interest for Intel's CEO? Given Intel's contract under the Secure Enclave program, has Mr. Tan disclosed any remaining investments, professional roles, or other ties to Chinese companies to the U.S. government? Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response. Sincerely, Tom Cotton United States Senator It seems like the 'Red Scare' has begun. And this... The Pentagon took a stake in US rare earth miner MP Materials... when will it do the same with Intel — zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 7, 2025 . . . Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 08:00",

    "fullContent": "Bank of England Cuts Rates To 4% After Historic Re-Vote The Bank of England cut interest rates by a quarter of a point to 4% in a hawkish decision that for the first time required a second round of voting, as the central bank contends with weak growth and high inflation, i.e. stagflation. In an unprecedented second vote by the Monetary Policy Committee after it initially failed to reach a majority verdict, five members voted for the quarter-point reduction to 4%, while four backed no change. That followed an earlier three-way split that failed to reach a majority when four voted for a 25bps cut (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden) and four voted for no change (Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine Mann and Huw Pill). Alan Taylor, an external member who had initially favored a bigger reduction, switched to back a quarter-point in the second round of voting. It was the first time in the 28-year history of the panel that two rounds of voting were needed to reach a presentable outcome on rates. The Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 5-4 to cut interest rates to 4%. Find out more in our #MonetaryPolicyReport https://t.co/jtJlDzsgEC pic.twitter.com/chFJVqXZoo — Bank of England (@bankofengland) August 7, 2025 Before the decision, economists had predicted less support for no change. “We’ve cut interest rates today, but it was a finely balanced decision,” said Andrew Bailey, the BoE’s governor. He repeated the central bank’s previous guidance that while rates were still on a downward path, “any future cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully”. In terms of the forward guidance, the Committee stuck to its previous message of “gradual and careful” easing but added a new sentence saying that “[t]he timing and pace of future reductions in the restrictiveness of policy will depend on the extent to which underlying disinflationary pressures continue to ease”, further emphasising a meeting-by-meeting approach. Second hawkish element of the minutes was the MPC’s comment saying “[o]verall, the MPC judges that the upside risks around medium-term inflationary pressures have moved slightly higher since May.” The fragmented vote illustrates the extent of disagreement at the UK central bank about how to respond to signs of fraying economic growth juxtaposed against an unsettling resurgence in inflation. In contrast, the US Federal Reserve has so far shirked from rate cuts this year to gauge prospective price pressures, incurring derision from President Donald Trump. The decision to lower borrowing costs by a quarter point matched market expectations, but the close nature of the vote sent the pound and gilt yields higher. The pound jumped against the dollar after the decision, climbing 0.5% to $1.3428. Gilts fell, sending the two-year yield six basis points higher to 3.88% as money markets reduced wagers on the extent of interest rate cuts from the BOE next year. Two-year gilt yields, which are sensitive to rate changes, rose 0.05 percentage points to 3.87 per cent, as traders braced for a slower pace of future cuts. Thursday’s decision comes amid a stagflationary conflagration, one where UK inflation is running at much higher levels than in the US or the Eurozone, while growth is slowing. The BoE is also wrestling with US President Donald Trump’s steep tariffs, which came into effect on dozens of trading partners on Thursday morning. However, the UK has been spared the harshest levies, securing a rate of 10 per cent. On Thursday, the BoE warned that higher food prices will drive inflation further above target in the near term, predicting a peak at 4 per cent in September, above than previous estimates.

    "fullContent": "Lilly Shares Tumble As Weak Weight-Loss Pill Data Overshadows Strong Earnings Eli Lilly shares plunged in premarket trading after disappointing results from its new weight-loss drug (a pill, rather than an injection) overshadowed strong second-quarter results and raised full-year guidance. Starting with the bad news: The topline data from the 72-week trial of orforglipron was underwhelming. Patients on the highest dose lost 11.2% of their body weight, compared to 2.1% for placebo. For comparison, Novo Nordisk's Wegovy demonstrated an average of 15% weight loss over 68 weeks in late-stage trials, while Lilly's Zepbound was around 20%. Orforglipron's results fall short of the current standard set by Wegovy and others, overshadowing strong second-quarter results and an increased full-year guidance. Here's a summary of Lilly's second-quarter results: Adjusted EPS: Came in at $6.31, a sharp increase from $3.92 a year ago. This shows strong profit growth. Revenue: Tops $15.56B, up 38% year-over-year, and beat the $14.7B Bloomberg Consensus estimate. Product Highlights: Zepbound (obesity drug): Generated $3.38B, up 46% quarter-over-quarter, and beat the estimate of $3.07B. Verzenio (cancer drug): Revenue was $1.49B, up 12% y/y, slightly misses the $1.52B estimate. Mounjaro (diabetes/obesity): Brought in a massive $5.20B. It remains a blockbuster. Other Notables: R&D Expenses: Spending rose to $3.34B, up 23% y/y, slightly above the estimate of $3.2B, indicating continued high investment trends in pipeline development. In markets, Lilly shares in New York plunged as much as 12% in premarket trading. If the losses hold through the cash session, sustaining at least a 12.35% decline (last seen on Oct. 9, 2008), then it would mark the largest single-day drop since the 29% crash on August 9, 2000. Wall Street also overlooked Lilly lifting both sales and profit forecasts for the year: Revenue: Lilly now expects to bring in $60B to $62B this year, up from its previous forecast of $58B to $61B. Bloomberg Consensus estimate: $60.07, so the new guidance is slightly more optimistic than what Wall Street was expecting. Adjusted EPS: Raised to $21.75 to $23.00, up from $20.78 to $22.28, signaling higher expected profitability. Lilly's decline sparked a bid in Novo shares. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 07:45",

President Trump's sweeping new tariffs officially took hold, as he barrels forward with his turbulent push to reshape global trade. The president also announced his plans for a 100% tariff on chip imports while exempting Apple with its increased US investment. Three Fed officials voiced their concerns over the US labor market, pointing to a potential rate cut in September. Nandini Ramakrishnan of JPMorgan believes that tariffs will be difficult for some EM countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, to handle. Thierry Wizman of Macquarie Group thinks the US government may want to raise the inflation target to 3%. “Bloomberg Brief” delivers the market news, data and analysis you need to set your agenda.
