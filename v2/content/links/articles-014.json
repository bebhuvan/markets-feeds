    "fullContent": "After 18 Years Without A Voice, AI-Powered Brain Implant Helps Stroke Survivor Speak Again At age 30, Ann Johnson’s life in Saskatchewan was full. She taught math and physical education at a high school, coached volleyball and basketball, and had recently married and welcomed her first child. At her wedding, she delivered a 15-minute speech filled with joy. Everything changed in 2005, when she suffered a brainstem stroke while playing volleyball with friends. The stroke left her with locked-in syndrome - near-total paralysis and an inability to speak. “She would try to speak, but her mouth wouldn’t move and no sound would come out,” researchers said. For nearly two decades, she communicated slowly using an eye-tracking system, spelling out words one letter at a time. In 2022, Johnson became the third participant in a clinical trial run by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, and the University of California, Berkeley. The project aimed to restore speech using a brain-computer interface, or neuroprosthesis, that bypasses the body’s damaged connections. Ann Johnson became paralyzed after a brainstem stroke in 2005, at age 30. As the third participant in a clinical trial led by researchers at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, she heard her voice again in 2022, the first time in 18 years. Noah Berger, 2023 “We were able to get a good sense of the part of the brain that is actually responsible for speech production,” said Gopala Anumanchipalli, an assistant professor at UC Berkeley who began the work in 2015 as a postdoctoral researcher with Edward Chang, a UCSF neurosurgeon. “From there, they figured out how to computationally model the process so that they could synthesize from brain activity what someone is trying to say.” The device records signals from the brain’s speech centers, sending them to an AI model trained to translate the activity into text, sound, or even facial animation. “Just like how Siri translates your voice to text, this AI model translates the brain activity into the text or the audio or the facial animation,” said Kaylo Littlejohn, a Ph.D. student and co-lead on the study. To give Johnson an embodied experience, researchers had her choose from a selection of avatars, and they used a recording of her wedding speech to recreate her voice. An implant plugged into a computer nearby rested on top of the region of her brain that processes speech, acting as a kind of thought decoder. Then they showed her sentences and asked her to try to say them. “She can’t, because she has paralysis, but those signals are still being invoked from her brain, and the neural recording device is sensing those signals,” said Littlejohn. The neural decoding device then sends them to the computer where the AI model resides, where they’re translated. “Just like how Siri translates your voice to text, this AI model translates the brain activity into the text or the audio or the facial animation,” he said. -Berkeley.edu For Johnson, the trial was emotional. “What do you think of my artificial voice? Tell me about yourself. I am doing well today,” she asked her husband during one session. The researchers had used a recording of her wedding speech to recreate her voice and paired it with a digital avatar she had chosen. “We didn’t want to read her mind,” Anumanchipalli emphasized. “We really wanted to give her the agency to do this. In some sessions where she’s doing nothing, we have the decoder running, and it does nothing because she’s not trying to say anything. Only when she’s attempting to say something do we hear a sound or action command.” The early version of the system had an eight-second delay between prompting Johnson and producing speech. But a March study in Nature Neuroscience described a streaming architecture that reduced that to about one second, enabling near-real-time translation. While the avatar in earlier tests bore only a passing resemblance to her, researchers say more lifelike 3D photorealistic versions are possible. “We can imagine that we could create a digital clone that is very much plugged in … with all the preferences, like how Zoom lets us have all these effects,” Anumanchipalli said. Johnson’s implant was removed in February 2024 for reasons unrelated to the trial, but she continues to advise the research team. She has urged them to develop wireless implants and told them the streaming synthesis “made her feel in control.” Looking ahead, Anumanchipalli said the goal is for neuroprostheses to be “plug-and-play” and part of standard medical care. “If that means they have a digital version of themselves communicating for them, that’s what they need to be able to do,” he said. Johnson hopes to work as a counselor in a physical rehabilitation facility, ideally using such a device. “I want patients there to see me and to know their lives are not over now,” she wrote to a UCSF reporter. “I want to show them that disabilities don’t need to stop us or slow us down.” Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 22:10",

    "fullContent": "Deep Throat For The Deep State Authored by Sasha Gong via American Greatness, By any normal standard, the recent filing from Voice of America (VOA) Director Michael Abramowitz - alleging the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) is trying to fire him illegally - should have been a Beltway bombshell. Instead, it barely rippled the news cycle. That’s convenient for the people who prefer the U.S. government’s vast international broadcasting complex to remain a black box, opaque, unaccountable, and - most importantly - under their control. I remember the last time a VOA director was shown the door. On January 20, 2021, less than two hours after Joe Biden took office, Robert Reilly told me over the phone, “The guards are escorting me out of the building right now.” That same day, the new administration swept out Trump appointees across the USAGM—VOA, RFE/RL, RFA, and MBN—leadership, included—and dissolved boards on the spot. Media outlets applauded, framing it as a restoration of “experienced journalists.” The subtext was unmistakable: the right people were back in charge. Here’s the problem. “Back in charge” at VOA under Biden did not mean neutral, mission-driven journalism beamed to the world. It meant a taxpayer-funded megaphone that echoed the ruling party’s priorities while targeting Donald Trump and his voters. Programming celebrated progressive policies, blurred the line between reporting and advocacy on immigration, and, in multiple languages, provided content that critics say veered into how-to guides for navigating U.S. benefits. When your transmitter reaches 45 language services, the line between domestic influence and foreign broadcasting doesn’t just blur—it disappears. At the center of the current drama is Michael Abramowitz, a former Washington Post editor tapped by then–USAGM chief Amanda Bennett. To Trump supporters, Abramowitz represents continuity with Washington’s media-political nexus; to his defenders, he’s a credentialed professional trying to keep politics out. Both can be true in Washington—and that’s precisely why the structure matters more than the personality. Donald Trump understood VOA’s strategic value. After his 2024 victory, he named Kari Lake, an experienced broadcaster, to lead VOA and redirect it to its core mission: telling America’s story credibly, not carrying any administration’s water. Instead, she ran headlong into a new maze of “reforms” installed during Biden’s tenure. Agency directors could no longer be removed by the CEO; ultimate authority now rested with a seven-member International Broadcasting Advisory Board (including the Secretary of State), whose members meet sporadically and require Senate confirmation—a process famous for taking forever when the minority decides it should. Another tweak eliminated the ability to appoint an interim CEO; the VOA director—inevitably a holdover—would automatically act in the role. Translation: permanent government beats elected government every time. This wasn’t a policy debate about programming standards. It was a procedural encirclement—belt-and-suspenders bureaucracy designed to outlast elections. If you think that’s too cynical, ask Michael Pack, Trump’s first-term USAGM nominee, who waited three and a half years for confirmation. Or ask Kari Lake, who arrived in Washington prepared to lead VOA and discovered she first had to run the gauntlet of a never-ending confirmation calendar. Trump adjusted. If the front door was barricaded, he’d use a side entrance—naming Lake a special adviser with a mandate to unwind a “defunct” agency (Hillary Clinton’s word, not his). That move triggered the present standoff with Abramowitz, who, according to staff accounts and his own legal filing, decided he would not step aside, would not facilitate reforms, and would instead force a legal-political confrontation that keeps the old machine humming. This is not a small fight. USAGM’s $1-billion apparatus shapes how hundreds of millions abroad understand America. If it becomes a domestically resonant propaganda arm—soft power turned inward—then we’ve crossed a line the charter was designed to prevent. And suppose its leadership can be insulated from electoral accountability by clever rule changes and Senate slow-walking. In that case, the “administrative state” has discovered yet another pressure point where it can outlast voters. The fix is simple in principle: restore electoral accountability while preserving the VOA Charter’s editorial independence, set firm timelines for Senate confirmation so nominations can’t be buried by delay, and re-center VOA on its core mission of telling America’s story abroad—measured annually by independent audits. Elections must have operational consequences, and the public should be able to see if the agency is living up to its mandate. Critics will object that giving a president more control risks politicizing coverage. That objection arrives decades too late. The choice isn’t between politicization and purity; it’s between politicization hidden inside an unaccountable bureaucracy and politicization constrained by law, sunlight, and elections. I’ll take the latter. Abramowitz’s lawsuit is not the story—it’s the symptom. The disease is a governing class that prefers to win by rule change rather than persuasion. If the people cannot change the direction of their own government media through the ballot box, then the “deep state” isn’t a conspiracy theory. It’s a workflow. Kari Lake promised to make VOA programming fairer, sharper, and more recognizably American. Let her try—or defeat her vision in the open, not by burying it in process. Sunlight, not stalemate, is the real test of confidence. If USAGM’s defenders believe in their product, they should welcome both. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 21:45",

    "fullContent": "U.S. SOUTHCOM Deploying 4,000 Troops To Latin American Waters As Counter-Narco-Terror Operations Loom The Trump administration is preparing for a large force projection across the Latin American and Caribbean theater. U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) will deploy 4,000 Marines and sailors to counter narco-terrorist cartels. The move aims to enhance hemispheric defense and deter or limit Chinese activity in the region, particularly around critical infrastructure and trade chokepoints. The news of this first comes from CNN, citing unnamed officials who stated: The deployment of the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit to US Southern Command, which has not been previously reported, is part of a broader repositioning of military assets to the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility that has been underway over the last three weeks, one of the officials said. A nuclear-powered attack submarine, additional P8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, several destroyers and a guided-missile cruiser are also being allocated to US Southern Command as part of the mission, the officials said. A third person familiar with the matter said the additional assets are “aimed at addressing threats to US national security from specially designated narco-terrorist organizations in the region.” While the deployment is intended primarily as a deterrent, it gives SOUTHCOM prepositioning and allows Trump broad military options if he orders action against narco-terrorists. Officials note the Marines aren’t trained for drug interdiction and would need Coast Guard support. The incoming buildup follows a Pentagon directive making border security, counter-narcotics, and protection of the Panama Canal top priorities. The deployment shifts U.S. assets from earlier Northern Command border operations to a sustained SOUTHCOM presence. Last week, The New York Times reported that Trump issued a directive authorizing the Pentagon to conduct direct military operations against certain Latin American drug cartels. Shortly afterward, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum rejected the future presence of U.S. military forces on her soil. By Wednesday evening, open source intelligence analysts posted flight tracking data of a General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper spy drone operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that flew deep into Mexico. The broader move here by the Trump administration is clear: Enhance hemispheric defense through counter-narcotics operations and maritime security. The second objective is to deter and limit Chinese activity in the region. By making moves to secure the Western Hemisphere, the Trump administration plans to disrupt command-and-control nodes between China and Latin American drug cartels that have waged irregular chemical warfare on the American people through the fentanyl crisis.

    "fullContent": "Why The Government Is Not The Answer To Urban Planning Via SchiffGold.com, City planning is a task that is often seen as a unique realm of governmental necessity. The existence of externalities means that the market could create extremely sub optimal outcomes when creating a city. For example, a house with a messy front yard hurts everyone, but the people in this house might have little incentive to clean up. A network of streets might not benefit its creator as much as the people who use it. While there are certainly some examples where the government intervening can be very helpful for most people, there are also many circumstances where government intervention is actually the key to a city’s demise. The importance of city planning is so great that it truly cannot be the decision of any one individual. Governmental city planning has many wins, but even more losses, not as a result of any specific government’s choices, but as a result of the institution’s inherent inability to capture information. The first problem with governmental urban planning is that they cannot effectively gather information on what people want. It would be uncommon for them to even run surveys on individual preferences. Beyond this, preferences themselves fluctuate. Predicting people’s preferences far into the future is almost impossible, and even more impossible for cash-strapped governments. People often cannot predict even their own preferences, so even if this information was to be gathered, there is no guarantee it would remain true. This harms city planning practically in the example of deciding how walkable a city will be versus how much it will allow people to live in the suburbs and commute in. The usefulness of a city is derived from how well it fulfills the preferences of its residents. People who try to make city planning a science don’t account for the fact that the exact same city would be a success or failure, depending entirely on the people who live within it. The second problem with government driven urban planning is that there is an extremely poorly-functioning feedback loop. Governments obscure their understanding of their own successes because they typically benchmark against other cities. They can only see their actions in conjunction with so many other environmental factors that it is difficult to disentangle the results of their policy and what would have happened anyways. The problem with benchmarking against other cities is that the inherently different environmental, social and legislative conditions of each city mean that a success for one city would truly be a failure for another city. However, there is too much pressure for urban planners to compare between fundamentally different cities. Sometimes a city will view itself as a failure and take drastic remedial action, but not realize that they have actually improved greatly from their previous state and would have kept proving with even less drastic action. Like anything in the study of humans, it is almost impossible to isolate factors within city planning. The relative success of a given district within a city might arise from 30 different subjective factors but also allow urban planners to falsely attribute the success to either outcome variables, or insignificant elements of the urban tapestry. A final limitation of governmental urban planning is the lackluster incentive structure. People are voted into office based on a wide variety of factors, but most often the most divisive policy points. Except for a few extreme cities, urban planning and infrastructure are not often in this list of big ticket items. While it directly affects people’s lives, they are more likely to attribute their sense of unhappiness on their commute to any policy other than the policies that actually created their roads and city structure. People like to think that things can be changed after one electoral cycle, but the problems that towns and cities face require years of complicated work in the same direction. Elected officials have the strongest incentives to satisfy the people’s desires, but the people who do most of the city planning lack this incentive as strongly. Urban planners are much more concerned with pleasing the bureaucrats and politicians who hired them then they do in developing an understanding of what the people of the city want. They are incentivized to present ideas that have worked in other places and are theoretically agreed-upon in general which leads them to creating spaces that work well in many places but not incredibly well in any one place. It is easy to tell when something has been created in this way because there are specific types of public transportation and urban spaces that seem to have been given the greenlight in the prestige-driven industry of urban planning.

Trump himself has been busy trying to temper expectations, calling it a \"feel-out\" meeting and the White House elsewhere referring to a \"listening exercise\" on the Ukraine war and bilateral Moscow-Washington relations.

OVERVIEW MEETING FORMAT US President Trump is to meet Russian President Putin in US territory at Elmendorf-Richardson Air Force Base near Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday, 15 August 2025. White House said US President Trump will participate in a bilateral program with the President of the Russian Federation in Alaska at 11:00AM (15:00EDT/20:00BST) and will depart Alaska at 17:45 (21:45/02:45BST). The Alaska summit will begin at 11:30 local time on Friday (20:30 BST/15:30 EDT), according to Russian Kremlin's Ushakov on Wednesday. Russian President Putin and US President Trump to have a one-on-one meeting with translators; also to have a wider meeting with delegations. US President Trump on Thursday said that he does not know if there will be a joint press conference with Russian President Putin after the Alaska meeting. Trump will have a press conference however the talks go. Russian delegation to include Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, Advisor Ushakov, Defence Minister Belousov, Finance Minister Siluanov and Special Envoy and head of Sovereign Wealth Fund Dmitriev. The meeting will be the first time the Russian leader has set foot on US soil since 2015. Ukrainian President Zelensky is not invited to the Alaska summit. PURPOSE: The meeting aims to explore ways to end Russia’s war against Ukraine. Russia's Kremlin said the central topic is Ukraine. The sides are to discuss trade and economic cooperation where there is \"huge untapped potential\". White House spokeswoman Leavitt described it as a “listening exercise\" to hear what Putin proposes. \"At the end of that meeting, probably the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,\" Trump said at a White House press conference. EXPECTATIONS The White House downplayed expectations, describing the meeting as a listening exercise. President Trump called it a leel-out meeting. US President Trump on Thursday assigned a 25% chance that the first meeting (Alaska) is not successful; and said he could be more sanctions if the meeting is not successful. Trump added Have economic incentives and disincentives at his disposal for the meeting; would rather not say about specifics. Incentives/sanctions are \"very powerful\". There are no plans to sign documents on the outcome of the Alaska summit between Russia and the US, via Ifx citing the Kremlin; would be a mistake to predict the outcome of the talks. \"All in all, it is difficult to envision a smooth solution to the Russia-Ukraine war through this summit, with Moscow demanding Ukraine give up some territory, a red line for Kyiv.\" Analysts at Rane suggest the Friday summit \"risks side-lining Ukraine, fracturing Western unity and creating space for Russia to delay sanctions, consolidate battlefield gains and promote a US-Russia framework that advances Russian strategic interests.\" Markets will likely focus on several factors: the prospect of looser US sanctions on Russia. how far Russia is willing to go on concessions. any tangible progress towards a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire. TRUMP'S CALL WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS ON WEDNESDAY US President Trump held a call with European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelensky, which he said was a very good call and \"rate it a 10\", while he will meet with Russian President Putin, then will call Zelensky and European leaders. Trump said there is a good chance of a second meeting and he would like to do a second meeting almost immediately which would include Zelensky if the first meeting goes okay, but there may not be a second meeting if he feels it is inappropriate or if he does not get the answers he wants. Furthermore, he said the first meeting is finding out what they are doing and a second meeting will be more productive, but warned that Russia will face consequences if the war is not stopped. US President Trump discussed with European leaders possible locations for a meeting between Zelensky, Trump and Putin after the Alaska summit, while locations include cities in Europe and the Middle East, according to Reuters citing sources. US President Trump reportedly told those on Wednesday's call that he is willing to contribute US security guarantees for Ukraine with some conditions, via Politico citing sources; openness that helps explain the cautious European optimism. Guarantees which are seen as key by Europe and Ukraine. However, Politico caveats that Trump did not elaborate on what he meant by security guarantees, and would only make this commitment of the effort is not part of NATO. RUSSIA'S PRE-MEETING COMMENTS Russian Foreign Ministry says Moscow expects Trump's visit to Russia after Alaska summit, according to AI Arabiya. \"We have a clear position that we will present at the Alaska summit and hope to continue the dialogue\". \"We do not speculate on anything in the future and we have clear arguments and positions that we will present during the Alaska summit\". Russian President Putin said the US is making a sincere effort to find a solution for the Ukraine crisis; US are seeking agreements that are acceptable to all, via Ifx. Peace will be strengthened if at the next stage Russia and US reach agreements in the field of strategic offensive arms control. New arms agreements with US are possible. UKRAINE INVOLVEMENT President Trump said he may arrange a subsequent meeting involving Zelensky and Putin, but he dismissed Zelensky’s desire to participate directly, noting that the Ukrainian leader has ' been to a lot of meetings' without ending the war. Zelensky criticised the summit's bilateral format, warning that any peace deal must be approved in a national referendum and that the absence of Ukraine would render an agreement illegitimate. RENEWED OFFENSIVE Ukrainian President Zelensky on August 12th posted, \"We see that the Russian army is not preparing to end the war. On the contrary, they are making movements that indicate preparations for new offensive operations.” Zelensky added that Russia is moving troops from the Sumy region to Pokrovsky, Zaporizhzhia, and is preparing for a new assault at the start of September. Zelensky said the current Russian push in eastern Ukraine is timed to coincide with Trump-Putin talks. Ukrainian President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that Ukraine will not cede land. Russian President Putin reportedly appears ready to test new nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered cruise missiles even as he prepares for talks with US President Trump, according to US researchers and Western security sources cited by Reuters. Ukraine's military says it struck Russia's port Olya in the Astrakhan region on Thursday and hit a ship with drone parts and ammo from Iran. STANCES RUSSIA'S POSITION Russian President Putin is seek ng to lock in Russia's territorial gains and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. Reports suggest Putin may have floated a ceasefire that asks Ukraine to cede much of Donetsk and to demilitarize Bloomberg reported on August 5th that the Kremlin is said to be mulling options for a concession to US President Trump that could include an air truce with Ukraine, in a bid to minimize the threat of secondary sanctions US and Russia reportedly planning Ukraine deal to cement Russ an territorial gains, according to Bloomberg (Aug 8th). Russia would halt its offensive in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine Russian President Putin reportedly demands Ukraine cede Donetsk Lunansk and Crimea. Putin told Witkoff he would agree to a complete cease-fire if Ukraine agreed to withdraw forces from all of Ukraine s Eastern Donetsk region. UKRAINE'S POSITION Ukrainian President Zelensky said he understood that Russia wants Kyiv to pull out of Donbas and will not advance in other directions in exchange, he added that Ukraine will not pull out of Donbas as such a move would open the way for Russia to attack Dnipropetrovsk. Zaporizhzhia regions, and Kharkiv Zelensky added that territorial issues should be discussed after the ceasefire and along with security guarantees for Ukraine. In a press conference, he warned that Russia wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region, but Ukraine's constitution prohibits surrendering territory. He also emphasized that giving up Donbas would become a springboard for future invasions; he insists Ukraine will not leave its fortifications or open an avenue for a Russian offensive. Ukraine insists on a durable ceasefire before any discussion of territorial issues. According to Politico Zelenskyy and European allies will use Wednesday's call tc push for a deal that demands a lasting ceasefire. Prior reports of softened Ukraine Stance Ukraine could agree to stop fighting and cede territory already held by Russia as pal of a European-backed plan for peace, according to The Telegraph (Aug 11th) Ukrainian President Zelensky reportedly told European leaders that they must reject any settlement produced by Trump, which sees them giving up Ukrainian land they still hold, but that Ukrainian territory in Russia's control could be on the table. This would mean freezing the frontline where it is and handing Russia de facto control of the territory it occupies EU/NATO POSITION EU and NATO leaders insist that Ukraine’s sovereignty and security guarantees are non-negotiable while analysts caution that land-swap proposals risk legitimizing aggression. NATO Secretary-Genera Rutte described the Alaska summit as a way to test Putin's seriousness and stressed that Ukraine must decide its own future he argued that only involving Ukraine and Europe will make any settlement EU Foreign Policy Chief Kallas said on August 11th that the EU will work on a 1st package of sanctions against Russia while she warned against concessions to Moscow. Germany said it will fund a USD 500m n package of military equipment and munitions Polish PM Tusk said they cannot allow the biggest powers to decide the fate of smaller countries without their participation and Russia wants to ink a reduction in NATO troops in Poland to the talks about Ukraine, while he added It will be easier for Poland's opponents to \"play us\" if we are not united. POTENTIAL SCENARIOS AND MARKET ANGLES No Deal [most likely]: Analysts consider it likely that the summit results n no ma or agreement Trump may simply gauge Put n s intentions and then coordinate with Zelenskyy and Europe. Broader sentiment will likely not be too swayed by a \"no deal\" amid low expectations heading into the meeting Limited Ceasefire [possible] This could be seen as progress toward de-escalation: on and potential easing of sanctions A \"limited ceasefire\" could be short-term negative for oil. defense stocks whilst stocks and EUR equities and EGBs could be buoyed Some analysts suggest Russia could use a limited ceasefire to regroup and delay sanctions. US-Russia Tensions Escalate [possible but not in bilateral interests] A further breakdown in relations between Moscow and Washington could see risk avers on and a rise in oil prices. Goldman Sachs: While lack of progress towards a ceasefire may lead renewed threats of secondary oil tariffs/sanctions, we see limited risk of large disruptions in Russia supply given the large volumes of Russian exports the possibility for deepening price discounts to maintain demand, and Iikely eagerness of the key buyers, India and especially China to continue energy cooperation with Russia As a reminder. US President Trump recently ordered two nuclear submarines to be \"positioned in the appropriate regions\" in response to \"highly provocative ’ comments by former Russian President Medvedev Land-Swap Proposal [possible but unlikely to be accepted]: If Trump agrees to a ceasefire that frontloads territorial concessions, analysts warn that Ukraine and Europe will reject it. Such a deal could trigger political backlash in Ukraine and may collapse due to constitutional and public opposition Short-term risk across markets amid progress toward de-escalation and potent al easing of sanctions with energy likely to slip. However, the reaction will likely fade if/when rejected by Ukraine. Comprehensive Framework [near-zero] Neither side currently appears willing to make the necessary concessions. Without Ukraine's participation on any framework is likely to faiI. Risk on. energy sold Goldman Sachs \"While a lasting peace agreement may potentially lead to a relaxation of US sanctions on Russian oil we wouldn't expect a significant short-term increase in Russian oiI supply in this scenario. The reason is that Russian production, in our view, has instead been constrained by CPEC+ quota decisions, low oi: investment, and a strong Ruble Here is what the most likely outcomes are according to a Bloomberg Markets Live poll: Source: Bloomberg HOUSE VIEWS BLOOMBERG: Bloomberg's John Authers citing Christopher Smart of the Arbroath Group says \"European defence stocks should fly on any lopsided deal that rewards Russia's aggression with oil prices likely to slump on even the whiff of looser sanctions on Russian oil... Beyond Europe, markets appear to have long since moved past the 2022 invasion, implying Friday s meeting has little potential to trigger a significant market shift. \" GOLDMAN SACHS: We don't expect the announced meeting between President Trump and President Putin, scheduled for Friday August 15 to cause a significant shift in Russian oil supply in key scenarios”. ING: If we do see some level of de-escalation, it could remove sanction risk from the oil market. This would likely drive prices lower, given the Bearish fundamentals .

Trump himself has been busy trying to temper expectations, calling it a \"feel-out\" meeting and the White House elsewhere referring to a \"listening exercise\" on the Ukraine war and bilateral Moscow-Washington relations. While the consensus among Western officials and pundits is that deal to finally end the war is likely yet still far away, \"we do expect some progress in today’s meeting and a path set for further discussions,\" according to Mohit Kumar, chief European strategist at Jefferies International. \"If we move toward a peace deal, it would be positive for the European markets.\" 🚨President Trump is officially on his way to Anchorage, Alaska where he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.pic.twitter.com/MHDw6NzjUx — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) August 15, 2025 Below is everything you need to know (via Newsquawk): Trump-Putin Summit in Alaska on Friday 15th August 2025; Summit to begin at 15:00 EDT/20:00 BST; Trump assigned a 25% chance the meeting will not be successful. OVERVIEW MEETING FORMAT US President Trump is to meet Russian President Putin in US territory at Elmendorf-Richardson Air Force Base near Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday, 15 August 2025. White House said US President Trump will participate in a bilateral program with the President of the Russian Federation in Alaska at 11:00AM (15:00EDT/20:00BST) and will depart Alaska at 17:45 (21:45/02:45BST). The Alaska summit will begin at 11:30 local time on Friday (20:30 BST/15:30 EDT), according to Russian Kremlin's Ushakov on Wednesday. Russian President Putin and US President Trump to have a one-on-one meeting with translators; also to have a wider meeting with delegations. US President Trump on Thursday said that he does not know if there will be a joint press conference with Russian President Putin after the Alaska meeting. Trump will have a press conference however the talks go. Russian delegation to include Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, Advisor Ushakov, Defence Minister Belousov, Finance Minister Siluanov and Special Envoy and head of Sovereign Wealth Fund Dmitriev. The meeting will be the first time the Russian leader has set foot on US soil since 2015. Ukrainian President Zelensky is not invited to the Alaska summit. PURPOSE: The meeting aims to explore ways to end Russia’s war against Ukraine. Russia's Kremlin said the central topic is Ukraine. The sides are to discuss trade and economic cooperation where there is \"huge untapped potential\". White House spokeswoman Leavitt described it as a “listening exercise\" to hear what Putin proposes. \"At the end of that meeting, probably the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,\" Trump said at a White House press conference. EXPECTATIONS The White House downplayed expectations, describing the meeting as a listening exercise. President Trump called it a leel-out meeting. US President Trump on Thursday assigned a 25% chance that the first meeting (Alaska) is not successful; and said he could be more sanctions if the meeting is not successful. Trump added Have economic incentives and disincentives at his disposal for the meeting; would rather not say about specifics. Incentives/sanctions are \"very powerful\". There are no plans to sign documents on the outcome of the Alaska summit between Russia and the US, via Ifx citing the Kremlin; would be a mistake to predict the outcome of the talks. \"All in all, it is difficult to envision a smooth solution to the Russia-Ukraine war through this summit, with Moscow demanding Ukraine give up some territory, a red line for Kyiv.\" Analysts at Rane suggest the Friday summit \"risks side-lining Ukraine, fracturing Western unity and creating space for Russia to delay sanctions, consolidate battlefield gains and promote a US-Russia framework that advances Russian strategic interests.\" Markets will likely focus on several factors: the prospect of looser US sanctions on Russia. how far Russia is willing to go on concessions. any tangible progress towards a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire. TRUMP'S CALL WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS ON WEDNESDAY US President Trump held a call with European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelensky, which he said was a very good call and \"rate it a 10\", while he will meet with Russian President Putin, then will call Zelensky and European leaders. Trump said there is a good chance of a second meeting and he would like to do a second meeting almost immediately which would include Zelensky if the first meeting goes okay, but there may not be a second meeting if he feels it is inappropriate or if he does not get the answers he wants. Furthermore, he said the first meeting is finding out what they are doing and a second meeting will be more productive, but warned that Russia will face consequences if the war is not stopped. US President Trump discussed with European leaders possible locations for a meeting between Zelensky, Trump and Putin after the Alaska summit, while locations include cities in Europe and the Middle East, according to Reuters citing sources. US President Trump reportedly told those on Wednesday's call that he is willing to contribute US security guarantees for Ukraine with some conditions, via Politico citing sources; openness that helps explain the cautious European optimism. Guarantees which are seen as key by Europe and Ukraine. However, Politico caveats that Trump did not elaborate on what he meant by security guarantees, and would only make this commitment of the effort is not part of NATO. RUSSIA'S PRE-MEETING COMMENTS Russian Foreign Ministry says Moscow expects Trump's visit to Russia after Alaska summit, according to AI Arabiya. \"We have a clear position that we will present at the Alaska summit and hope to continue the dialogue\". \"We do not speculate on anything in the future and we have clear arguments and positions that we will present during the Alaska summit\". Russian President Putin said the US is making a sincere effort to find a solution for the Ukraine crisis; US are seeking agreements that are acceptable to all, via Ifx. Peace will be strengthened if at the next stage Russia and US reach agreements in the field of strategic offensive arms control. New arms agreements with US are possible. UKRAINE INVOLVEMENT President Trump said he may arrange a subsequent meeting involving Zelensky and Putin, but he dismissed Zelensky’s desire to participate directly, noting that the Ukrainian leader has ' been to a lot of meetings' without ending the war. Zelensky criticised the summit's bilateral format, warning that any peace deal must be approved in a national referendum and that the absence of Ukraine would render an agreement illegitimate. RENEWED OFFENSIVE Ukrainian President Zelensky on August 12th posted, \"We see that the Russian army is not preparing to end the war. On the contrary, they are making movements that indicate preparations for new offensive operations.” Zelensky added that Russia is moving troops from the Sumy region to Pokrovsky, Zaporizhzhia, and is preparing for a new assault at the start of September. Zelensky said the current Russian push in eastern Ukraine is timed to coincide with Trump-Putin talks. Ukrainian President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that Ukraine will not cede land. Russian President Putin reportedly appears ready to test new nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered cruise missiles even as he prepares for talks with US President Trump, according to US researchers and Western security sources cited by Reuters. Ukraine's military says it struck Russia's port Olya in the Astrakhan region on Thursday and hit a ship with drone parts and ammo from Iran. STANCES RUSSIA'S POSITION Russian President Putin is seek ng to lock in Russia's territorial gains and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. Reports suggest Putin may have floated a ceasefire that asks Ukraine to cede much of Donetsk and to demilitarize Bloomberg reported on August 5th that the Kremlin is said to be mulling options for a concession to US President Trump that could include an air truce with Ukraine, in a bid to minimize the threat of secondary sanctions US and Russia reportedly planning Ukraine deal to cement Russ an territorial gains, according to Bloomberg (Aug 8th). Russia would halt its offensive in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine Russian President Putin reportedly demands Ukraine cede Donetsk Lunansk and Crimea. Putin told Witkoff he would agree to a complete cease-fire if Ukraine agreed to withdraw forces from all of Ukraine s Eastern Donetsk region. UKRAINE'S POSITION Ukrainian President Zelensky said he understood that Russia wants Kyiv to pull out of Donbas and will not advance in other directions in exchange, he added that Ukraine will not pull out of Donbas as such a move would open the way for Russia to attack Dnipropetrovsk. Zaporizhzhia regions, and Kharkiv Zelensky added that territorial issues should be discussed after the ceasefire and along with security guarantees for Ukraine. In a press conference, he warned that Russia wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region, but Ukraine's constitution prohibits surrendering territory. He also emphasized that giving up Donbas would become a springboard for future invasions; he insists Ukraine will not leave its fortifications or open an avenue for a Russian offensive. Ukraine insists on a durable ceasefire before any discussion of territorial issues. According to Politico Zelenskyy and European allies will use Wednesday's call tc push for a deal that demands a lasting ceasefire. Prior reports of softened Ukraine Stance Ukraine could agree to stop fighting and cede territory already held by Russia as pal of a European-backed plan for peace, according to The Telegraph (Aug 11th) Ukrainian President Zelensky reportedly told European leaders that they must reject any settlement produced by Trump, which sees them giving up Ukrainian land they still hold, but that Ukrainian territory in Russia's control could be on the table. This would mean freezing the frontline where it is and handing Russia de facto control of the territory it occupies EU/NATO POSITION EU and NATO leaders insist that Ukraine’s sovereignty and security guarantees are non-negotiable while analysts caution that land-swap proposals risk legitimizing aggression. NATO Secretary-Genera Rutte described the Alaska summit as a way to test Putin's seriousness and stressed that Ukraine must decide its own future he argued that only involving Ukraine and Europe will make any settlement EU Foreign Policy Chief Kallas said on August 11th that the EU will work on a 1st package of sanctions against Russia while she warned against concessions to Moscow. Germany said it will fund a USD 500m n package of military equipment and munitions Polish PM Tusk said they cannot allow the biggest powers to decide the fate of smaller countries without their participation and Russia wants to ink a reduction in NATO troops in Poland to the talks about Ukraine, while he added It will be easier for Poland's opponents to \"play us\" if we are not united. POTENTIAL SCENARIOS AND MARKET ANGLES No Deal [most likely]: Analysts consider it likely that the summit results n no ma or agreement Trump may simply gauge Put n s intentions and then coordinate with Zelenskyy and Europe. Broader sentiment will likely not be too swayed by a \"no deal\" amid low expectations heading into the meeting Limited Ceasefire [possible] This could be seen as progress toward de-escalation: on and potential easing of sanctions A \"limited ceasefire\" could be short-term negative for oil. defense stocks whilst stocks and EUR equities and EGBs could be buoyed Some analysts suggest Russia could use a limited ceasefire to regroup and delay sanctions. US-Russia Tensions Escalate [possible but not in bilateral interests] A further breakdown in relations between Moscow and Washington could see risk avers on and a rise in oil prices. Goldman Sachs: While lack of progress towards a ceasefire may lead renewed threats of secondary oil tariffs/sanctions, we see limited risk of large disruptions in Russia supply given the large volumes of Russian exports the possibility for deepening price discounts to maintain demand, and Iikely eagerness of the key buyers, India and especially China to continue energy cooperation with Russia As a reminder. US President Trump recently ordered two nuclear submarines to be \"positioned in the appropriate regions\" in response to \"highly provocative ’ comments by former Russian President Medvedev Land-Swap Proposal [possible but unlikely to be accepted]: If Trump agrees to a ceasefire that frontloads territorial concessions, analysts warn that Ukraine and Europe will reject it. Such a deal could trigger political backlash in Ukraine and may collapse due to constitutional and public opposition Short-term risk across markets amid progress toward de-escalation and potent al easing of sanctions with energy likely to slip. However, the reaction will likely fade if/when rejected by Ukraine. Comprehensive Framework [near-zero] Neither side currently appears willing to make the necessary concessions. Without Ukraine's participation on any framework is likely to faiI. Risk on. energy sold Goldman Sachs \"While a lasting peace agreement may potentially lead to a relaxation of US sanctions on Russian oil we wouldn't expect a significant short-term increase in Russian oiI supply in this scenario. The reason is that Russian production, in our view, has instead been constrained by CPEC+ quota decisions, low oi: investment, and a strong Ruble Here is what the most likely outcomes are according to a Bloomberg Markets Live poll: Source: Bloomberg HOUSE VIEWS BLOOMBERG: Bloomberg's John Authers citing Christopher Smart of the Arbroath Group says \"European defence stocks should fly on any lopsided deal that rewards Russia's aggression with oil prices likely to slump on even the whiff of looser sanctions on Russian oil... Beyond Europe, markets appear to have long since moved past the 2022 invasion, implying Friday s meeting has little potential to trigger a significant market shift. \" GOLDMAN SACHS: We don't expect the announced meeting between President Trump and President Putin, scheduled for Friday August 15 to cause a significant shift in Russian oil supply in key scenarios”. ING: If we do see some level of de-escalation, it could remove sanction risk from the oil market. This would likely drive prices lower, given the Bearish fundamentals .

    "fullContent": "Fewer Women Are Using Birth Control Pills In The US Fewer women in the United States are opting for birth control pills than before, according to KFF data. Where 33 percent of women aged 18 to 49 years old said they used oral contraceptives in 2022, that had ticked down to 29 percent in 2024. As Statista's Anna Fleck reports, after male condoms, the pill is still the most commonly used form of contraception in the U.S. You will find more infographics at Statista Recently, there has been a growing number of influencers on TikTok criticizing different forms of hormonal birth control and promoting tracking fertility cycle apps instead. This goes against experts’ advice, which states that contraceptives such as the pill and IUDs are safe and effective and that risks have been exaggerated online. This is a trend that has been seen in other countries too. The BBC reports that in the United Kingdom, some women are moving away from “hormonal” products such as the pill to “natural” fertility tracking apps. While in Germany, health concerns have been cited in recent years, with younger women in particular moving away from the pill. The KFF reports that almost four in ten (39 percent) of women of reproductive age have heard something on social media about birth control in the past 12 months, including half (49 percent) of women aged 18 to 25. Meanwhile, one in seven women aged 18 to 25 said they made a change or thought about making a change to their birth control method because of something they saw or heard on social media. 2024 data shows that emergency contraception increased by 5 percentage points compared to two years prior. This brings it to 12 percent of U.S. women aged 18 to 49. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 20:30",

    "fullContent": "Indonesia Will Play A Key Role In Russia's Asian Balancing Act Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto was Putin’s guest of honor during mid-June’s St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. The privilege that was bestowed upon him wasn’t surprising since bilateral ties have greatly strengthened since last year as documented here in January. Russia envisages Indonesia playing key role in its Asian balancing act, which will only grow after their newly signed strategic partnership agreement. The present piece will detail some of the forms in which this will take. To begin with, Russia helped Indonesia complete its accelerated accession to BRICS as a full-fledged member, for which Prabowo thanked Putin during their meeting and in statements to the press afterwards. The evening beforehand, Putin told the heads of international news agencies during his meeting with them that Indonesia’s nearly 300 million people enable it to play a larger role in the global economy, with the innuendo being that this will lead to it playing a greater role in global governance too. It's here where the relevance of Indonesia’s Russian-assisted accession to BRICS comes into play. Although cooperation within BRICS is purely voluntary, the group can still collectively contribute to accelerating financial multipolarity processes and then gradual reforms to global governance afterwards. Accordingly, given Indonesia’s growing economic and corresponding political weight in the world coupled with their traditionally friendly ties, Russia expects that they can cooperate more closely to this end. In pursuit of this goal, which is assessed to be the driving force behind their strategic partnership, both countries are prioritizing the comprehensive expansion of their economic, political, and military ties. From Russia’s perspective, the economic dimension can open new markets for all manner of energy and real-sector exports, closer ties with de facto ASEAN leader Indonesia can give Russia more of a presence in that bloc, and more military-technical cooperation can strengthen Indonesia’s own balancing act. About that, Indonesia multi-aligns between rival powers just like India does, and closer military-technical cooperation with Russia could help it avoid the growing zero-sum dilemma to commit to China or the US. After all, closer such cooperation with either of them could unsettle the other and lead to more pressure upon Indonesia, but China probably wouldn’t mind its Russian strategic partner supplying Indonesia with arms while the US might not overreact to this if their incipient rapprochement remains on track. As for Russia’s Asian balancing act, it aims to preemptively avert disproportionate dependence on China, some of the consequences if troubled Indo-US ties improve, and being caught in a zero-sum dilemma to commit to one over the other. Closer economic ties with Indonesia therefore help Russia hedge against trade dependence on China, closer military-technical ones could partially replace declining market share in India, and closer political ties with ASEAN can give Russia more flexibility amidst the Sino-Indo rivalry. Altogether, Russia and Indonesia play complementary roles in one another’s balancing acts, with each serving as valve of sorts from the pressure to commit to China-India and China-US respectively. Their close Soviet-era strategic cooperation before General Suharto’s mid-1960s coup serves as a nostalgic reference point for the level of relations that their contemporary leaders are eager to revive. Now is the perfect time to do so, and since there aren’t any impediments, the future of their ties looks very bright. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 20:05",

    "fullContent": "Hezbollah Chief Threatens 'No Life In Lebanon' If Government Moves To Disarm It Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem has warned that if the Lebanese government moves to disarm Hezbollah, which is the large Shia militia group backed by Iran, then the whole country will suffer destabilization, death, and destruction. He claimed that there would be \"no life in Lebanon\" should its weapons be taken by force - which brings to mind the mass death and destruction the country experienced during the prior two-decade long Lebanese civil war of the end of the 20th century. Via AFP The United States has long exerted immense pressure on the Lebanese government of President Joseph Aoun to take away Hezbollah's weapons. These pressures have amplified in the wake of the recent Israel-Lebanon war, which subsided due to a fragile truce. This is why Qassem has accused the Lebanese government of in essence \"implementing an American-Israeli order to end the resistance, even if it leads to civil war and internal strife.\" \"The resistance will not surrender its weapons while aggression continues, occupation persists, and we will fight it… if necessary to confront this American-Israeli project no matter the cost,\" he continued, warning the government \"not to hand over the country to an insatiable Israeli aggressor or an American tyrant with limitless greed.\" Without doubt, Hezbollah has been immensely weakened since last year's assassination of longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah - and the killings of many other top and mid-level leaders. Hezbollah's abiding by the ceasefire with Israel is a reflection of this. However, the last year has seen sporadic airstrikes on southern Lebanon by Israel. The fall of Assad in Syria last December has also greatly weakened Hezbollah. Still, the group remains the single most well-armed and militarily powerful entity in the Lebanese state. It is actually stronger that the Lebanese Army. So if there is a big move to disarm Hezbollah, there's a likelihood that indeed the whole state would unravel - also at a moment the country has been experience economic collapse, and destruction due to recent Israeli bombings. The general view among regional analysts is that Hezbollah, representing the 'Shia axis', has ultimately lost at this point. This is also underscored in the fact that the Israeli army is now occupying large swathes of southern Syria - perhaps less than a dozen miles from the outskirts of Damascus.

    "fullContent": "Gerrymandering, Race-Pandering, & Political-Meandering Authored by Arthur Schaper via American Greatness, Gerrymandering, the political practice of carving up awkward-looking legislative districts to benefit one party’s political power, has slithered into the public conversation once again. Some of us remember the history behind this political practice, starting with the governor of Massachusetts, Elbridge Gerry. Democratic-Republicans want to shore up their new power in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Federalist opponents of the maneuver mocked one of the serpentine-like districts created by the party, christening the shape with claws, wings, and a razor-sharp mouth, calling the monstrosity “The Gerrymander.” Why has the discussion roared into the public consensus this time? It started with the Texas legislature’s efforts to redraw its state’s districts after a request from the Trump Administration to review the fairness of the districts. Yes, there is gerrymandering in Texas, but not the way that liberal reformers want to portray the problem. Consider some of the urban, Democratic Congressional districts in Texas: the 29th, 32nd, and 33rd, for example, are obscenely drawn. These contortions are examples of race pandering, or “race-mandering,” which result from the tortured misuse of the Voting Rights Act and fears of ongoing legal challenges from left-wing legal activists demanding more majority-minority districts. This kind of lawfare recently forced Alabama and Louisiana to create gerrymandered districts. Texas is not alone in this fight, either. Ohio has to redraw its Congressional districts. This opportunity could create three more Republican-leaning Congressional seats, while the Texas legislature advances a map creating five more GOP seats. Of course, Governor Abbott and the Republican leadership have floated increasing the GOP advantage to six to eight seats if absent Democrats refuse to come back to work in their vain efforts to break legislative quorums. Democrats have not helped their cause by fleeing to Illinois, whose districts are so gerrymandered that even Stephen Colbert poked fun at them. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who bravely pushed through a race-neutral Congressional map in 2021, netting four more GOP seats, has offered to redraw the Congressional districts yet again, in part because the state population has grown due to an increase in migration from failed blue states. DeSantis deserves credit for the current GOP-mandering effort, since he had refused weak maps from the Florida RINOs at the beginning of the decade. Indiana, Missouri, and South Carolina are also exploring more daring redistricting efforts, not just because of Trump’s leadership and Texas’s fight, but because the United States Supreme Court will be reviewing the “majority-minority” provisions in the Voting Rights Act. Democrats and liberal pundits fear that the court will strike them down entirely, wiping away the need for “majority-minority districts” and ensuring that Republicans gain more seats! Republicans are fighting back, and Democrats don’t like that the Republicans are using their tactics against them. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is running for President even though he won’t admit it, is leading the charge, demanding that fellow Democrats start fighting with fire, although they started the fire, perfecting the art of gerrymandering under the guise of independent commissioners. Newsom urged the California legislature to reform the state’s Citizens Redistricting Commission to create more Democratic-favoring districts. The problem with this effort, though, is that Democratic-leaning states already have some of the most heavily gerrymandered districts in the country. Maryland had three Republicans as recently as 2003, but has reduced the number with creative redrawing. Illinois is the most gerrymandered state, despite relying on an independent commission. New York State tried to push through one of the most gerrymandered districts possible, but even the all-Democratic New York Supreme Court rejected the naked political grab from Albany politicians. Declining Governor Kathy Hochul wants to jump into the fray anyway. They wear their lawlessness like a dinner jacket. Even Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey jumped on the merry gerrymander bandwagon. She made a total fool of herself. All nine Congressional districts are gerrymandered to the Democrats’ advantage, since the Bay State hasn’t had a Republican Congressman since 1997. Republicans are looking good going into Election 2026, but there are rumblings against the gerrymandering sparring. Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA) has introduced legislation to stop the national mid-decade redistricting efforts. This effort is understandable, since Kiley will likely lose his seat should Gavin Newsom get his way. However, the country needs a strong GOP majority in both chambers to ensure lasting electoral and cultural change, and if a couple of seats get lost in California but more make up for the loss in other states, I can live with it (and I live in California). Kiley appears to be panicking unnecessarily, as there is no legal way for Newsom to push through his so-called ‘Newsom-mandering’ without significant legal retaliation. Moreover, Newsom’s efforts are not winning him support from California voters or liberal columnists. Should we be concerned about the constant political meandering caused by redistricting? Voters deserve consistency in representation. I do not agree with banning mid-decade redistricting, especially if a state’s population shifts or changes radically within a decade. Independent commissioners don’t work—they are unaccountable to the people, and still produce gerrymandered districts. California Globe dishes on this perfectly. We have already discussed Illinois, with its contorted, snake-like districts designed to force out Republican congressmen, even though they garnered 43% of the vote in the 2024 election. State legislatures should be required to draw the districts. How do we prevent the ridiculous salamander shuffle, though? If the district covers multiple counties, at least one should be placed entirely within the congressional district. If a governing county is large enough to incorporate more districts, then it should not straddle more than one other county. Municipal and geographical boundaries should be respected. No portion of a congressional district should be thinner than 20 miles. Lastly, the notion that districts are set in stone despite gerrymandering or partisan advantage is dubious in the long run. Political demographics and voting patterns change, and even well-entrenched incumbents face losses when they lose touch with voters. Nothing is static in politics.
