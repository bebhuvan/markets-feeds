    "fullContent": "Democrats Go Into Meltdown Mode As Trump Launches Washington DC Takeover The 68-square-mile federal district of Washington DC is often excluded from lists of various US cities and their crime rates due to its unusual status. DC itself has long suffered from high crime and is regularly among the top twenty most crime ridden cities in the US. In 2023, the city's homicide rate and overall violent crime rate spiked to highs not seen since 1997 at the height of a gang related murder spree. Democrats argue that crime has been falling since 2024 and love to cite stats over the past year without taking into account the bigger picture. Yes, DC murders have fallen by 26% in that time, but that's after they nearly doubled from 2019 to 2023. Murder, theft and mass looting continues to pose a threat to the DC area and lets not forget that close neighbor Baltimore is one of the worst cities for crime in the entire nation. In 2024, Baltimore was named the deadliest city in America, surpassing Memphis and Detroit (both Democrat run cities). For decades Washington has remained a Democrat run town. Regardless of any Republican presence in the White House, DC stands as a progressive citadel controlled by deeply leftist bureaucrats. Since the establishment of the Home Rule Act in 1973, the district has not had a single conservative mayor and the town has suffered greatly under Democratic management. The capital is notorious for its low prosecution and conviction rates. DC only prosecutes 33% of total arrests and many criminals easily avoid prison time. Democrat politicians running most of America's largest cities have created an environment in which perpetrators have little fear of punishment and convicts are often released back onto the streets to become repeat offenders. To be fair, many GOP presidents have dismissed the problems in DC as frequently as Democrat presidents. Donald Trump is the first to take action since home rule was established. Trump's announcement that he will be instituting a federal surge within the capital and taking control of local law enforcement has triggered a furious meltdown among progressive leaders, activists and media pundits. They claim that this is just the beginning of a larger martial law takeover of cities across the US. CNN is in full-blown meltdown mode because President Trump is trying to make Washington DC safe again! pic.twitter.com/7Jrb7bHOox — Vince Langman (@LangmanVince) August 11, 2025 Because of Washington's 92% progressive population (and large minority population), the response from locals is unsurprisingly frantic. Business owners seem optimistic about a potential improvement in enforcement but others are not so enthused. DC residents who oppose Trump cleaning up the city react: “He shouldn’t be making those kinds of decisions. That’s more like a dictator. Everybody now is in like a big ol gumbo pot. You know what I’m saying?” pic.twitter.com/LMPfYaxiZG — TheBlaze (@theblaze) August 11, 2025 The question no Democrat is asking is, what level of crime is acceptable for the nation's capital? How many murders, assaults, rapes and looted stores should be tolerated? They say crime is falling while overlooking the jump in 2023. They say that Trump's elimination of home rule in DC is not the answer. So, what is the answer? Trump asserts that DC should be setting an example as one of the safest places in the country; a perfectly logical conclusion considering the US capital has been an embarrassment for many years. It's also important to take into consideration that Trump's presidency, nestled in one of the most hostile areas of the US for conservatives, could be at risk. Trump's actions may be designed to prevent any future French Revolution-like attacks on the White House. Leftists have been using mob intimidation with impunity since 2020 and the local political leadership of DC is only going to encourage such behavior going forward. The Democrat response? \"Trump's trying to take attention away from the Epstein files...\" In other words, anytime Trump does anything they don't like they will play the only card they have to play, which is to divert discourse by mentioning Epstein. Keep in mind, the Democrats had years to release any information they obtained on the Epstein case and they never did. Now that Trump is in office, suddenly this is the only issue they're interested in talking about. MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude has a TDS MELTDOWN after Trump announced plans to crack down on crime in DC: \"I'm trying to hold my temper... He’s going to undermine the democratic process in the district!\"pic.twitter.com/H0xfMTPxF0 — Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) August 11, 2025 The bottom line is that Washington DC is a problem area of the country and always has been. It should be a shining example of national pride, but it's a disaster instead. Trump is not wrong that the capital needs to be cleaned up and his solution will probably achieve that result quickly. That said, are Democrats right to fear a wider martial law response in other US cities? Is this simply a test run by Trump to pave the way for similar actions in LA or Chicago? Is martial law something that conservative voters would largely support? Or, is this narrative simply fear mongering by leftists who are trying to prevent Trump from successfully restructuring DC while making them look bad in the process? It's unlikely that the majority of Americans, including conservative Americans, would support full scale or long term martial law (Democrats would likely support it, just not under Trump). It is, however, fair to point out that the mismanagement and activism of Democrat leaders in US cities has made the country so despondent and angry that the populace might just cheer for a short term federal takeover if it happened. The political left doesn't seem to understand the level of rage they have created, or the joy that the public would feel seeing incompetent Democrats thrown out of their offices and removed from local power.

    "fullContent": "Trump's \"Deadly Serious\" Russia Squeeze Shown In Big Tariffs On Ally India By Simon Watkins of OilPrice.com Trump has doubled tariffs on Indian imports to 50% over New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil. The move risks nearly 1% of India’s GDP this year but underscores U.S. determination to coordinate with the EU on sanctions to weaken Russia’s economy and deter its geopolitical ambitions. India, alongside China and Turkey, remains a top buyer of Russian oil, and Washington is preparing similar tariff threats. “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,” U.S. President Donald Trump posted last week on Truth Social. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA.” These words directly implicate buyers of Russian oil as accomplices in the murder of tens of thousands of Ukrainian people in the war started by the Kremlin on 24 February 2022, as indeed they have been. Had these words been said in 2008 when Europe continued to buy Russian oil after it attacked Georgia, or in 201,4 when the continent continued to buy Russian oil after it annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region, then the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine might never have happened. They were not said, it did happen, but this time around, the U.S. President is looking to the future in his actions today. His seriousness is further underlined by the fact that India – long seen as a key ally to Washington in the Asia-Pacific region – now faces big tariffs. So what does this all mean, and what will happen next? Slightly in advance of the 8 August deadline imposed by Trump on Russia to make a peace deal with Ukraine, the U.S. doubled its tariffs on India to 50% -- a rate that will come into effect on 27 August. The U.S. is India’s top export market, constituting 18% of its exports and 2.2% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Many of the country’s major exporting firms had already stated that they could not deal with the 25% tariffs, as they are too high to absorb, and passing them on to customers makes their products uncompetitive. Initial analysts’ estimates are that 50% tariffs could reduce India’s GDP by nearly 1% this year. But the U.S. knows all this, which is one of the reasons why it has chosen to do it, according to a very senior European Union (E.U.) energy security source who spoke exclusively to OilPrice.com on the day of the new Indian tariffs announcement. “India is known as a key ally of the U.S. globally, and especially in Asia Pacific, and the thinking is that if he [Trump] is willing to do that to India, then he would be willing to do that to anyone else, and this is absolutely the case – he [Trump] is deadly serious on squeezing Russia’s economy from here,” he said. “The message should not be lost on European countries who might be thinking of easing up on the sanctions being rolled out on Russia from now to December 2027 [when the intention is to end all imports of Russian oil and gas],” he added. Indeed, a closely co-ordinated ramping up of sanctions against Moscow by the U.S. and E.U. is seen by both sides as key to preventing Russian President Vladimir Putin from realising his dream of reconstituting the full scope of the U.S.S.R.’s previous European empire, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. “Trump believes that the continuation of European purchases of Russian oil and gas after the annexation of Crimea, especially in 2014, was key to the Russian action in Ukraine in 2022, as underlined in his comments on the Nordstream gas pipelines [from Russia to the heart of Europe],” he highlighted. In this context, India has a multi-layered strategic importance to the U.S. The most notable of these is the objective of positioning it as the regional counterweight to China’s economic, political, and military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. Washington’s efforts in this regard intensified following the 15 June 2020 clash between Chinese and Indian troops in the disputed territory of the Galwan Valley in the Himalayas, as the U.S. believed this marked a new push back strategy from India against China’s policy of seeking to increase its economic and military alliances through its multi-generational power-grab project, the ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ (BRI). The U.S. further believed that this push back might also be echoed in India’s economic desire to finally make substantive progress on its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy as an alternative to China’s BRI programme. However, for this to work, India would need access to secure energy sources over the long term, as – like China – it has few oil and gas sources of its own. Indeed, given the potential economic growth projections for India, the International Energy Agency forecast that the Asian sub-continental power would constitute the biggest share of global energy demand growth at 25% in the coming two decades. In fact, the IEA predicted India would overtake the European Union as the world’s third-biggest energy consumer by 2030. It was at this point – in Trump’s first term as president – that the plan was hatched to link this plan to use India to challenge China as Asia’s major power in parallel with a corollary objective to use the UAE to promote further relationship normalisation deals (‘Abraham Accords’) between Israel and key Arab states in the Middle East. This remains a second key reason why India is so important to Washington. Nevertheless, India – along with China and Turkey – is still one of the biggest buyers of Russia's energy exports three years into Moscow’s war in Ukraine. According to industry figures, last month saw it receive 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Russia, while China imported around 1 million bpd and Turkey about 500,000 bpd. Over the entirety of 2024, China was the largest buyer of Russian oil, at about 2.2 million bpd, followed by India on 1.76 million bpd, and Turkey on 0.3 million bpd. The U.S. has already warned China that ongoing imports of Russian oil could lead to huge tariffs being imposed on the country, according to the E.U. source. “During the talks [end-July U.S.-China trade talks in Stockholm], [U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott] Bessent told his opposite number [Vice Premier He Lifeng] that legislation [‘Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025’] is being drawn up in Congress authorising the imposition of up to 500% tariffs on countries that buy sanctioned Russian oil,” he exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. In reality, the Act goes wider to encompass any country that “knowingly sells, supplies, transfers, or purchases oil, uranium, petroleum products, or petrochemical products that originated in the Russian Federation”. It currently has 84 listed co-sponsors in the U.S. Senate alone, according to the U.S. Congress website, and the Speaker of the House has also indicated his chamber’s support to pass the bill. The U.S. has also suggested to China that it may treat Beijing’s assistance to Russia in much the same manner as it has started to treat the same for Iran. This was seen in the very recent U.S. State Department announcement on Iran-related sanctions that it would impose sanctions on 20 entities it believes are engaged in trading Iranian oil and petrochemical products, including China’s Zhoushan Jinrun Petroleum Transfer Co., an oil terminal in the greater Zhoushan port area. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson said of these China sanctions that: “The Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict in the Middle East to fund its destabilizing activities, [and] Today, the United States is taking action to stem the flow of revenue that the regime uses to support terrorism abroad, as well as to oppress its own people.” Zhoushan Jinrun was highlighted by the State Department for: “…knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran”. The port is the fourth of China’s to be sanctioned by Washington in recent weeks, following similar actions against Huaying Huizhou Daya Bay Petrochemical Terminal Storage in March, Guangsha Zhoushan in April, and Dongying Port in May. “More is to come,” the very senior U.S. legal source told OilPrice.com at the time of the sanctions announcement and could include a dramatically increased list of blacklisted Chinese officials, businesses, banks, financial houses, ports, ships, and supportive infrastructure to the facilitation of Russian oil imports.
