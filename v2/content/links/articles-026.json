Kennedy Jr. on Aug. 1 announced more repeals of federal policy that rewarded hospitals for reporting staff vaccination rates.</strong></p> <a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%284%29.jpg?itok=OuHygOqA\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%284%29.jpg?itok=OuHygOqA\"><picture><figure role=\"group\" class=\"caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images\"><img alt=\"\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"52fd6e44-1747-4a80-adda-e20edb03efe6\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_80%284%29.jpg?itok=OuHygOqA\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"500\" /><figcaption><em>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Capitol Hill in Washington on May 20, 2025. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a> <p>Kennedy said in a <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cms-end-vaccine-reporting-incentives.html\">press release</a> that the policy was coercive and denied informed consent.</p> <p>“<strong>Medical decisions should be made based on one thing: the wellbeing of the person—never on a financial bonus or a government mandate</strong>,” Kennedy said. “Doctors deserve the freedom to use their training, follow the science, and speak the truth without fear of punishment.”</p> <p>Created under the Biden administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) inpatient payment rule, the policy linked hospital reimbursement to staff vaccination reporting.</p> <p>“<strong>Doctors and other providers should have the same autonomy to choose what’s right for their own individual health care needs as the patients for whom they care.</strong> Today’s announcement helps put that power back in their hands,” CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in the press release.</p> <p>The move represents the most recent policy repeal under CMS. These moves are “part of a broader HHS effort to restore medical autonomy in federally funded programs and root out financial and regulatory pressures that incentivize physicians towards pre-scripted medical decisions rather than individualized, evidence-based care,” according to the press release.</p> <p>Since taking office as HHS secretary, <strong>Kennedy has implemented multiple changes regarding vaccines.</strong></p> <p>The Food and Drug Administration in late May said it planned to limit access to future COVID vaccines to people 65 and older and individuals with underlying health conditions.</p> <p>The agency also announced it would permit vaccine manufacturers to coordinate in-depth studies to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID vaccines in children and younger, healthy adults.</p> <p>In recent months, HHS has also <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/epochtv/rfk-dismisses-all-17-members-of-cdcs-vaccine-committee-installs-new-replacements-facts-matter-5884358\">dismissed</a> all 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel, ended the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/cdc-stops-recommending-covid-vaccine-for-healthy-children-pregnant-women-5863960\">recommendations</a> for pregnant women and healthy children, and ordered the <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/rfk-jr-orders-removal-of-mercury-from-flu-vaccines-5891415\">removal</a> of mercury from influenza vaccines.</p> <p><strong>After it voted to advise officials to stop recommending influenza shots that have mercury, the remade Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) said it plans to look at multiple other vaccines.</strong></p> <p>Martin Kulldorff, the new chair of ACIP, said on June 26 that one proposal is to notify the CDC that young children should not receive the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) combination immunization.</p> <p>The agency instead would recommend that children under the age of 47 months get two separate vaccines: the measles, mumps, rubella shot, and the varicella, or chickenpox, vaccine.</p> <a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%285%29_0.jpg?itok=tZoA8rK8\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%285%29_0.jpg?itok=tZoA8rK8\"><picture><figure role=\"group\" class=\"caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images\"><img alt=\"\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2324aeae-0300-42af-94d3-0a3ef507ca36\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_80%285%29_0.jpg?itok=tZoA8rK8\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"500\" /><figcaption><em>Martin Kulldorff, the new chair of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, during a committee meeting in Atlanta, Ga., on June 25, 2025. Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a> <p>Kulldorff noted that the change would reflect data that indicate the MMRV combination vaccine causes more febrile seizures. The CDC reported the same information in a background paper dated June 25.</p> <p>A vote on the issue could happen as early as the next ACIP meeting, which is expected to be held in August or September.</p> <p>Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, <a href=\"https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/statement-on-the-june-meeting-of-the-advisory-committee-on-immunization-practices/\">said</a> in a statement that “re-examining the childhood vaccine schedule and the use of thimerosal are both politically motivated actions that are not based on science.”</p> <p><strong>“Raising questions without adequate data casts doubt on vaccination, which can further drive down confidence in vaccines. More than any other medications, vaccines are extensively and constantly reviewed and evaluated,” she added.</strong></p> <p>During the ACIP meeting, Kulldorff explained that Kennedy had given the committee “a clear mandate to use evidence-based medicine for making vaccine recommendations.”</p> <p>“Vaccines are not all good or bad. If you think that all vaccines are safe and effective and want them all, or if you think that all vaccines are dangerous and don’t want any of them, then you don’t have much use for us—you already know what you want,” he said.</p> <p>“But if you wish to know which vaccines are suitable for you and your children and at what ages, then we will provide you with evidence-based recommendations,” he added.</p> <p>ACIP members who were removed by Kennedy said the panel has “lost credibility.” The former members wrote in a July 30 New England Journal of Medicine commentary that the process for recommending vaccines is “rapidly eroding.”</p> <p>On Aug. 1, the <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/cdc-removes-outside-experts-from-vaccine-review-panels-5895387\">CDC</a> notified some outside groups that they can no longer participate in panels that review vaccine data and form recommendations for the ACIP.</p> <p>The panels meet behind closed doors and typically include members of the ACIP, which <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/our-work/index.html\">advises</a> the CDC on vaccines. The workgroups are also composed of experts from liaison organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p> <p>Groups that employ the experts have been informed that they won’t be part of the workgroups any longer, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the CDC’s parent agency, told The Epoch Times on Aug. 1.</p> <p>An official said some groups are being removed from the workgroups because of concerns that they have conflicts of interest.</p> <p>For instance,<strong> the American Pharmacists Association <a href=\"https://www.pharmacist.com/corporate-supporters\">lists</a> vaccine manufacturers such as GlaxoSmithKline and Moderna among its corporate supporters.</strong></p> <p>“Under the old ACIP, outside pressure to align with vaccine orthodoxy limited asking the hard questions. The old ACIP members were plagued by conflicts of interest, influence, and bias. We are fulfilling our promise to the American people to never again allow those conflicts to taint vaccine recommendations,” Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the HHS, told The Epoch Times in an email.</p> <a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%286%29_1.jpg?itok=wCKbH3MH\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%286%29_1.jpg?itok=wCKbH3MH\"><picture><figure role=\"group\" class=\"caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images\"><img alt=\"\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f32b40a1-80b9-4478-9289-0b3d8dda1dc1\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_80%286%29_1.jpg?itok=wCKbH3MH\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"500\" /><figcaption><em>A healthcare worker fills a syringe with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami on Oct. 5, 2021.

We had 2 dissents as it was. With this No Silver Lining Jobs Data, there would have been a lot of pressure to cut. The unemployment rate, which hasn’t been bad, has largely been stable because we have seen a 0.4% reduction in the labor force participation rate since April.</p> <p>Certainly, my flight back from London would have been more enjoyable as the data would have been even worse than my already pessimistic views and Treasuries could have continued their strong performance. It isn’t just our view that was hit by data that now looks very incorrect. On the July print, if memory serves, only 1 economist surveyed had an estimate that was higher. Now, it looks like in hindsight, that every estimate was above the actual number (though closer on average to the original print).</p> <p>The real-world impact of having inaccurate data is problematic (and let’s be honest, for all we know this month’s data will be revised higher next month – which doesn’t change the argument that Garbage In, Garbage Out needs to be addressed).</p> <h3>It’s Not Just Jobs Data</h3> <p>We have often made well-reasoned arguments (some would say, rants) around incorrect inflation data. The owners’ equivalent rent is fraught with issues, including significant lag time. We’ve argued that the country voted based on the inflation they saw in the real world, not the calculated inflation (which seemed low on many things – like health insurance costs). Many look to things like Truflation to get potentially more accurate, real-time information (though not sure what good it does, if policy makers don’t).</p> <p>The jobs data has caught everyone’s attention, it is time to address data across the board.</p> <p>Let’s not forget we live in an electronic and AI world, which should help us get better answers.</p> <h3>Two Problems</h3> <p><strong>The Collection Problem.</strong></p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/osmr/response-rates/\">Survey Response Rates. </a>The initial survey response rate has been between 25% and 35% for the past year. Prior to 2020, the initial response rate averaged close to 70%. We now get less than half of the initial responses than before, and that seems problematic. <ul><li>By final revisions, the response rate is typically above 90%, even approaching 98%. <strong>Maybe we should stop pretending NFP is timely</strong>? If we get far more respondents after the initial publication, it isn’t surprising that the data is all over the place.</li> </ul></li> <li>There are collection problems on almost any data series. It is part of living in the real world, but how do we address these problems and try to minimize them?</li> </ul><p><strong><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/estab%20survey%20response%20rate.jpg?itok=FhNOUlJx\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/estab%20survey%20response%20rate.jpg?itok=FhNOUlJx\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"89a18eed-5a0c-4109-b635-b7cf0b6d6855\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"322\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/estab%20survey%20response%20rate.jpg?itok=FhNOUlJx\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></strong></p> <p><strong>The Seasonal Adjustment Problem.</strong></p> <ul><li>Even if the underlying data was perfectly accurate (it isn’t) we move on to the “seasonal adjustments.” <strong>We “love” adjusted data as it provides “smoother” data. </strong>Apparently we couldn’t handle that the Non-Seasonally adjusted jobs were -1.07 million, +360k, +703k, and +825k for the past four months (in all honesty, I don’t know whether those have been adjusted or not via revisions, but that is the actual jobs data). <ul><li><strong>Is there any reason to believe that the BLS (or anyone) has the “best” seasonal adjustment methodology</strong>? I think not, as I’d like to see as many different estimates as possible.</li> </ul></li> </ul><p>So, we have all these incredibly smart, well-resourced economists trying to do 1 of 2 things:</p> <ul><li><strong>Determine, to the best of their abilities, the number of jobs created.</strong></li> <li>Guess what the jobs numbers calculated by the BLS will be, and then guess what the adjustments will be. To the extent that this is prevalent, it reduces the impetus to change existing official methodologies.</li> </ul><p>While “similar” the two things are very different.</p> <p>The first is a truly valid exercise in establishing where the economy stands and providing data to make good decisions. <strong>Despite that, it is somewhat useless if no one believes you and just gravitates to the officially published data.</strong></p> <p>The second is what makes careers. Bloomberg reports analysts that are most “accurate.” Not accurate in terms of what the final data comes in at, but at predicting the pseudo random number that comes out the first Friday of the month (or other dates, for other data series).</p> <p><strong>My bet gravitates towards the crowd-sourced efforts of economists trying to predict the actual state of the economy </strong>(though I’m not sure if that is the goal of many, or trying to guess the NFP is the goal, which is similar but different).</p> <h3>Some Food for Thought on Solutions</h3> <p>Enough ranting and rehashing old arguments. Let’s take a peek at some potential solutions, or at least some ideas that we think warrant discussion.</p> <p><strong>Getting the most accurate, timely data as possible.</strong></p> <p>Every year, our employers send the IRS our tax forms, that include our income and our Social Security, so the IRS can link all of our employment income together. W2s and 1099s have to cover a significant part of the legal work force. Maybe I’m wrong, but I would expect that W2s and 1099s would cover a large percentage of the legal, documented workforce. It misses under the table payments, all cash jobs, and probably some sole proprietorship jobs, but virtually everyone I know receives at least 1 paycheck a month (some are weekly, or biweekly).</p> <p><strong>So how about providing some “encouragement” for companies to provide that information every month?</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Privacy concerns? </strong>Sure, but the federal government (IRS), and probably your state will all get this information over the course of time. Does it really matter whether they know your monthly data in addition to the annual data? Sure, my initial reaction is that this seems sketchy, but is it really? Certainly, some information could be “redacted” so individuals don’t stand out (though it would still likely need to be collated by SSN to determine those working multiple jobs). 1099s may pose some similar issues (by SSN or EIN), but it seems like something that should be “workable.”</li> <li><strong>What do we mean by “encourage”? </strong>Maybe a reduction in certain payroll taxes. Maybe even a small rebate to the company and/or the employee. Would this cost some money? Yes, but would the cost be more or less than living with data that is so unreliable that it leads to bad decisions at the policy, corporate, and even individual level? Data collection in any form tends to have expenses, but doing something to encourage (or mandate) timely data would be interesting.</li> </ul><p>Just imagine a world where on the 20th of each month (just to pick a date) anyone cutting checks that will show up on W2 or 1099 reports, sends (in an identical format) the information to the data collection area (probably involving the IRS, as they are the ones already entitled to this information on an annual basis).</p> <p><strong>That data is plunked into an algo that then comes up with changes in employment.</strong></p> <p>Would we be missing some parts of the economy? Sure. Without a doubt. <strong>But would we have highly accurate information on the vast majority of the economy? Probably</strong>. This part of the jobs report could be published as such. Then we can all try to spend time figuring out what is happening in the part of the economy that is not captured.</p> <p>Again, I’m not advocating for giving up our privacy, but the reality is that the information goes to the government, just not in this organized or frequent type of approach. I presume companies or payroll companies could code this additional step in a matter of weeks. Yes, maybe I’m missing a lot of legal issues, but can this really be worse than a survey?</p> <p><strong>I would also like to see some “cohort” analysis. </strong>What I like about Case-Schiller is that it tracks a set of houses, not every house. There is effectively a “control” group. For wage inflation, it would be great to see data by cohort. Track the wage of a particular person over time. <strong>When we think about wage inflation, we think about what people get paid over time. </strong>This sort of methodology would mimic that. It could also potentially be done by income bracket (now this might be going too far, but just tossing it out there). What we currently get on average hourly earnings is a change in the entire pool of workers. <strong>But if someone retires and is replaced by a new employee at a much lower wage, the current methodology would likely see lower wage inflation than there really is. </strong>Tracking by cohorts over time may give a better read on wage pressures than existing methodologies. This is a second order effect, but hey, why not try to make a really robust report?</p> <p><strong>Open source the seasonality.</strong> Let’s publish both the unadjusted number (as volatile as that is) along with the adjusted number and the algorithm used to do that adjustment. Then the brightest or most curious minds can try to improve it. In this day and age, I wouldn’t bet against a group of kids in college playing around with the methodology and figuring out improvements – especially if we have reduced the range of issues around the data collection.</p> <p>Whether or not these ideas make any sense, there should be some simple steps taken.</p> <ul><li><strong>Identify and implement ways to reduce the margin for error on broad swaths of the labor force</strong>. The more data that can be collected very accurately means we have less to worry about on the data that isn’t calculated as accurately. <ul><li>Then focus on ways to reduce the errors in the data that isn’t as accurately collected.</li> <li>In parallel, work on ways to ensure that the adjustments are realistic and up to date with the current economy (a major shift in jobs (like AI and Data), or the GIG economy, or regional preferences as where people live and work has changed). Adapt and refine.</li> </ul></li> </ul><p><strong>Finally, and this might sound weird, stop pretending that the data is accurate to the nth degree.</strong></p> <p>Imagine having only a yard stick with no measurements marked in between. Then being asked to use that yardstick to measure a long distance over a hilly, rocky field. You take that yardstick and to the best of your ability, flip it over and over, counting the number of flips until you have traversed the field.</p> <p>Then you come with an answer of 3,423 yards and 12 inches. <strong>There is no way the methodology laid out can produce something to that degree of accuracy. </strong>Maybe you could say that given the terrain, slippage, etc., we estimate between 3,400 and 3,500 yards, which isn’t as satisfying as 3,423 yards and 12 inches, but does convey a more accurate assessment of the situation. <strong>Significant figures exist in science for a reason, to avoid creating the perception of more accuracy than there really is. </strong>Maybe more of our economic data should incorporate that concept?</p> <p><strong>Maybe we need a warning note along with the data?</strong></p> <p>We are getting warnings about almost everything these days. Objects in the mirror might be closer than they appear. Not eating fully cooked food. You get the idea.</p> <p>Maybe the warning label should be:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Before using this data, the margin for error is 136,000 for the Establishment Survey. Yes, the margin for error is larger, in some cases, than the actual number we report. Please rely on this data at your own risk as it may or may not be accurate, may be changed multiple times in the coming months, and again in annual revisions. If you think that is a wide margin of error, then we warn you not to even think about the margin for error in the Household Survey. <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.tn.htm\">BLS Technical Notes.</a></em></p> </blockquote> <h3>Bottom Line</h3> <p>I do not believe that the BLS intentionally gets anything wrong in either direction, but I do believe that in an era with so much of the data floating around electronically and the ability to apply hardcore computing power to that, we should be reinventing our data collection and publication tools to the greatest extent possible (I would include inflation and other important metrics in this project).</p> <p>I do not like the idea of “shooting the messenger” as that doesn’t create the goal of true intellectual honesty in developing new and better tools.</p> <p>Garbage In, Garbage Out should no longer be acceptable, and we should be able to corral the will and the resources to mitigate that risk.</p> <p>End rant, and have a great weekend!</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-04T01:00:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 21:00</span>",

As a result, for the first time since 1996, a strike will begin at midnight, impacting operations at key fighter jet plants. </p> <p>\"IAM District 837 members have spoken loud and clear, they deserve a contract that reflects their skill, dedication, and the critical role they play in our nation's defense,\" IAM District 837 Directing Business Representative Tom Boelling stated in a <a href=\"https://www.goiam.org/news/iam-district-837-members-in-st-louis-reject-latest-boeing-offer-strike-for-fair-contract/\">press release</a>, adding, \"We stand shoulder to shoulder with these working families as they fight for fairness and respect on the job.\"</p> <p>The 3,200 machinists were in a week-long federally mandated \"cooling-off\" period after rejecting Boeing's initial labor contract last Sunday. By Friday, Boeing presented a modified offer that included a 20% pay boost, raising average annual pay from $75,000 to $102,600, along with other perks, including a $5,000 signing bonus. </p> <p>For some context, the last time IAM District 837 went on strike was in 1996, a labor action that lasted 99 days. There's no telling how long the current stoppage will last, but it will undoubtedly impact operations at the F-15, F/A-18, and cutting-edge missile and defense technologies plants. </p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/2025-07-28_08-07-26.png?itok=IV6ghU8m\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-07-28_08-07-26.png?itok=IV6ghU8m\"><img alt=\"\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-07-28_08-07-26.png?itok=IV6ghU8m\" width=\"500\" /></a></p> <p>The timing of the strike comes as the world is on fire and deepening into a bipolar state.

Charlie Savage <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/us/politics/trump-russia-durham-explainer.html\">wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, and other Trump allies have declared that a newly declassified report on the Russia investigation provides “evidence that the Clinton campaign plotted to frame President Trump and fabricate the Russia collusion hoax.” The reality is almost precisely the opposite… The report shows that a purported email that Trump supporters have long tried to portray as a smoking gun is instead most likely a fake. Russian spies appear to have tried to make it seem authentic by assembling passages lifted from <strong>actual emails</strong> by different hacking victims…</em></p> <p><em>Mr. Trump and his aides have coupled those releases with wild and inaccurate claims about what they show, spinning the reports as proof of his long-running narrative that the investigation was a hoax instigated by enemies for political reasons.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This whole “assembled by Russian spies” line is based on one assessment about a pair of emails likely pulled by Russians from other <em>real </em>American victims of hacking. Beyond this instance of a “composite,” the paper ignores the gigantic load of material from the same source, which has been described in multiple other reports as real and affecting numerous American “victims” from the Executive and Legislative branches, as well as think-tanks and NGOs.</p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130041.042.jpg?itok=FMy-9MeS\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130041.042.jpg?itok=FMy-9MeS\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"823566aa-2ef8-45cc-9265-adc6b13c85eb\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"332\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130041.042.jpg?itok=FMy-9MeS\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p> <p>More irritating is Savage’s diatribe against Patel and the hoax “narrative,” offered without mentioning the roughly ten million instances in which the <em>Times </em>botched its coverage of Patel and Republican investigations into Russiagate. When Patel and then-House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes released the much-denounced “Nunes memo” about FISA abuse in early 2018, Savage <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/02/us/politics/nunes-memo-gop-fbi-annotated.html\">personally “annotated” the document</a>, which would be vidicated more or less entirely by an <a href=\"http://file///Users/matthewtaibbi/Desktop/120919-examination.pdf\">Inspector General investigation nearly two years later</a>. About the accusations of FISA abuse, which included use of the Steele dossier to obtain surveillance authority, Charlie wrote:</p> <ul><li> <p>The FBI had ““grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy,’” adding, “In accusing the F.B.I. of omitting important information, this memo’s critics say the memo itself omits crucial context: other evidence that did not come from Mr. Steele, much of which remains classified.”</p> <p>This is the much-used initial argument that the Steele material wasn’t important to the FISA warrant.<strong> </strong>Savage went with this talking point multiple times, also saying in another piece, “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/us/politics/secret-memo-mueller-russia-investigation.html\">Mr. Steele’s information was only one thread in a tapestry of evidence from various sources that the memo ignored, exaggerating its relative importance</a>.<strong>” </strong>Inspector General Horowitz dashed that, concluding Steele “<a href=\"http://file///Users/matthewtaibbi/Desktop/120919-examination.pdf\">played a central and essential role</a><strong>”;</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Savage went on in the “annotation”: “It makes no note of the fact that [Carter] Page attracted the F.B.I.’s interest in 2013, when agents came to believe that Russian spies were trying to recruit him.” Why didn’t Patel include that detail? Because Page was an informant in good standing with the CIA at the time, a fact an FBI lawyer was criminally <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/29/fbi-lawyer-trump-russia-probe-email-463750\">convicted for omitting</a>. Savage, who later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/us/politics/kevin-clinesmith-probation.html\">wrote about Kevin Clinesmith’s conviction</a>, omitted the same critical detail as Clinesmith — perhaps unknowingly, but still;</p> </li> <li> <p>Savage wrote, “The language used here on Mr. Steele’s relationship with the F.B.I. suggests that it was formal. But he <strong>never entered into any formal relationship</strong> from which he could be suspended or terminated, according to people familiar...” Steele was <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/imo/media/doc/abbreviated%20timeline%20horowitz.pdf\">terminated</a> as a source by the FBI “for cause” on November 17, 2016, years before the annotation article, showing Savage’s “people familiar” either weren’t “familiar” or were yanking his chain. Colleague Scott Shane would describe the firing as a decision by the FBI to “end the <strong>formal</strong> relationship” with Steele. Oops.</p> </li> </ul><p>For what it’s worth, the <em>Times </em>without Savage’s help also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russian-bots-school-shooting.html\">swallowed the Hamilton 68 hoax whole</a> and described the #ReleaseTheMemo hashtag as the work of Russian “bots”; ran an editorial called “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/nunes-memo-trump-mueller.html\">The Nunes memo is all smoke, no fire</a>”; and ran a full house editorial (one that again cited the phony Hamilton 68 dashboard, by the way) describing the Nunes report as a “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/opinion/devin-nunes-republicans-memo.html\">fake scandal</a>” designed, like the Clinton email investigation, to distract from the “real conspiracy” investigated by Robert Mueller. This sounds remarkably like today’s story, which described the Durham release as an effort to “change the subject from its broken promise to release Jeffrey Epstein files.” They write the same stories, over and over. It never ends.</p> <p>The part that really infuriated today, however, was this section:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>In reality, the F.B.I. opened its investigation based on a lead it received from the Australian government in late July 2016, after WikiLeaks released Democratic emails stolen by Russian hackers and disrupted the Democratic convention. The tip involved a Trump campaign adviser suggesting, before the hacking had become public, that the campaign had received outreach from Russia and knew what it would do.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This paragraph is an outrage. It’s carefully written to conceal how utterly the <em>Times </em>botched one of the most impactful stories of the Russiagate affair, a story called “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html\">How the Russia Inquiry Began: A Campaign Aide, Drinks and Talk of Political Dirt</a><strong>.” </strong>This professed to be the origin story of Russiagate, explaining that on July 26th, 2016, four days after Wikileaks <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/22/on-eve-of-democratic-convention-wikileaks-releases-thousands-of-documents-about-clinton-the-campaign-and-internal-deliberations/\">leaked thousands of documents</a> damaging to the Democratic Party, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html\">Australian authorities told American counterparts</a> about a suspicious Russia-themed conversation Trump aide George Papadopoulos had with a diplomat named Alexander Downer.</p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130105.805.jpg?itok=6rXuoUsb\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130105.805.jpg?itok=6rXuoUsb\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b3e6f76b-e9b5-4975-a693-0bd394f90616\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"599\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130105.805.jpg?itok=6rXuoUsb\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p> <p><em>The infamous “drinks and dirt” story</em></p> <p>The <em>Times </em>reported that Papadopoulos had been told of “dirt” Russia had, in the form of “thousands of emails that would embarrass Mrs. Clinton,” given to him by a Maltese professor named Josef Mifsud, presented as a cutout for Russia. This was described as a “driving factor” for the FBI <a href=\"https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CFH%20Timeline%20w%20Updates%2020201203%20(FINAL).pdf\">opening its “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation</a> into Trump and Russia on July 31, 2016.</p> <p>Almost everything about this story was wrong. It took a while, but Downer himself eventually admitted there was no “dirt” talk, or email talk. From the public Durham report:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>According to Downer, Papadopoulos <strong>made no mention of Clinton emails</strong>, <strong>dirt</strong> <strong>or any specific approach by the Russian government to the Trump campaign team with an offer or suggestion of providing assistance</strong>. Rather, Downer's recollection was that Papadopoulos simply stated \"the Russians have information” and that was all.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Downer also said he “did not get the sense Papadopoulos was the middle-man to coordinate with the Russians.” More infuriating? The FBI dropped Papadopoulos as a lead weeks into the Crossfire Hurricane inquiry, with Deputy Director Alexander McCabe testifying that his comments “didn’t particularly indicate” contact with Russians:</p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130123.701.jpg?itok=e8aXUJhY\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130123.701.jpg?itok=e8aXUJhY\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"781d2e09-7934-4a90-895f-0e37653b057e\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"224\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130123.701.jpg?itok=e8aXUJhY\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p> <p>Screwing up “dirt” and “thousands of emails” is bad, but the McCabe testimony shows the FBI knew in in August of 2016 that Papadopoulos was a dead-end. But “current and former American officials” polished that turd and fed it to the <em>Times </em>a full year and a half later. The paper then used it for its blockbuster tale about how Papadopoulos played a “critical role” in the Russiagate drama.</p> <p><strong>This will go down as an infamous screw-up and smear.</strong> Papadopoulos was totally uninvolved with any intelligence scheme and merely used as a technical pretense to start what proved to be a bogus investigation. Still, the <em>Times </em>plastered his face all over its front page as the scandal’s poster child, in what in hindsight was a proud advertisement for how badly they’d been bent over by their sources.</p> <p>Now, years later, Savage not only re-writes this passage without the name “Papadopoulos” and without references to “dirt” or “thousands of emails,” but uses sleight-of-hand to suggest what <em>was </em>said between the young Trump aide and the Australian diplomat was meaningful. He describes a “Trump campaign adviser suggesting, before the [Russian] hacking had become public, that the campaign had received outreach from Russia and knew what it would do.” <em>Knew what it would do? </em>Savage leaves out the fact that Papadopoulos had not, in fact, received outreach from Russia, and did not have or claim to have foreknowledge of hacking. He played no meaningful role. It’s part of the <em>Times </em>legend<em> </em>that he did, however, so Charlie twisted the prose like a pipe cleaner to fit the few remaining usable factoids.</p> <p>The irony is that while Papadopoulos was not the real beginning of Russiagate, the story Durham told about the U.S. acquiring a large chunk of intelligence from Russia far earlier in 2016 likely was. This was real intelligence concerning Russia that was embarrassing to Clinton, not Trump. Even at this late date, after so many Russiagate stories the paper screwed up, they continue to vomit up this nonsense.

Only without Russian influence—it needs to be cleared of that,” Zelenskyy <a href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1947803089626427753\">wrote</a> on social media at the time, saying that Ukraine must ensure “the inevitability of punishment for those who go against the law.”</p> <p>In response to the measure, thousands of Ukrainians rallied in Kyiv and other cities in the largest protests since the Russian invasion in 2022, accusing the government of undermining hard-won anti-graft safeguards.</p> <p>The European Union, which granted Ukraine candidate status in 2022, warned that the law violated one of the bloc’s core accession requirements: maintaining the independence of anti-corruption institutions.</p> <p>EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos <a href=\"https://x.com/MartaKosEU/status/1947663547233710152\">called</a> the July 22 law a “serious step back,” while the EU’s <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/zelenskyy-signs-new-law-reshaping-anti-corruption-bodies-prompting-protests-eu-concern-5891402\">delegation</a> to Ukraine said dismantling NABU’s safeguards would jeopardize trust in Kyiv’s reform efforts.</p> <p><strong>Germany’s foreign minister similarly <a href=\"https://x.com/GermanyDiplo/status/1947970535402697026\">warned</a> that curbing the agencies’ powers risked slowing Ukraine’s path to EU membership.</strong></p> <p>The backlash was compounded by a separate security operation that week in which Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/ukrainian-parliament-votes-unanimously-to-restore-independence-of-anti-corruption-agencies-5894778\">conducted</a> around 70 searches targeting NABU officials, arresting one on suspicion of spying for Russia, and another over alleged business ties to that country.</p> <p>While most allegations involved minor administrative violations, NABU warned that some of the actions had gone too far and accused authorities of trying to intimidate the watchdogs.</p> <p>Amid public protests and mounting pressure from Western allies, Zelenskyy reversed course. On July 24, he <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/zelenskyy-backtracks-on-anti-corruption-law-after-protests-eu-criticism-5892405\">submitted</a> a new bill restoring the agencies’ independence, <a href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1948349119589765420\">calling</a> the text “well-balanced” and excluding “any Russian ties,” and ensuring protection of Ukraine’s law enforcement system against Russian influence or interference.</p> <p>The Ukrainian Parliament <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/ukrainian-parliament-votes-unanimously-to-restore-independence-of-anti-corruption-agencies-5894778\">passed</a> the measure in a unanimous vote on July 31, and Zelenskyy <a href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1950902199363444819\">signed</a> it the same day, calling it the “right decision.”</p> <p>“<strong>It is very important that the state listens to public opinion</strong>,” he wrote on social media. “That it hears its citizens. Ukraine is a democracy–without a doubt.”</p> <p>The law prohibits the prosecutor general from issuing orders to NABU or SAPO, or interfering in their investigations, and reinstates key procedural safeguards lost under the earlier legislation.</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T23:15:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 19:15</span>",

However, <strong>Massie's opposition to US involvement in Israel's war seemed to have been the last straw</strong>. Trump assigned his top political operatives Tony Fabrizio and Chris LaCivita to start and run the super PAC.
