Lawrence, as of today, we have over 80,000 applicants for those ten thousand positions already,\" Noem said. She continued, \"People and patriots across this country that say we want to join. We want to help and be a part of this effort. It's overwhelming to see the amount of response in support that our ICE officers have gotten.\" 🚨 HUGE! @Sec_Noem tells Fox News’ @LawrenceBJones3 that ICE has received 80,000 applicants for the agency’s 10,000 new officer positions pic.twitter.com/ti2rY0uEYn — TV News Now (@TVNewsNow) August 6, 2025 Perhaps the financial incentives, such as $50,000 signing bonus and tens of thousands in student loan repayment, were enough to drive the surge in applications. These benefits are clearly outlined on ICE's official website. https://t.co/nZkBEj3GGi pic.twitter.com/N7cFpDhb7W — Homeland Security (@DHSgov) August 5, 2025 Text from the website states: \"America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out. You do not need an undergraduate degree.\" Democrats are going insane about ICE's messaging to bolster its forces - because just a few short years ago, these far-left lawmakers were trying to abolish the agency while facilitating the invasion of criminal illegal aliens. 2018. AOC mentions Kamala Harris as a supporter of her radical agenda, which at the time included abolishing ICE. Now Kamala is promising to add more agents and secure the border. Kamala is not a leader. She is a grifter. pic.twitter.com/PjueAU9OPp — MAZE (@mazemoore) October 15, 2024 Meanwhile, the official X account of South Park made things even more viral. Wait, so we ARE relevant?#eatabagofdicks https://t.co/HeQSMU86Da — South Park (@SouthPark) August 5, 2025 One X user said, \"When the government is funnier than you, time to retire.\" https://t.co/mcBs2o2w9Y pic.twitter.com/6xvWzdoK3Z — Jessica 🇺🇸 (@RealJessica05) August 5, 2025 This all comes as anti-ICE attacks have skyrocketed by 830%, much of which has to do with Democrats and their dark-money billionaire-funded NGO network producing dangerous anti-ICE rhetoric.

    "fullContent": "'Lawfare At Its Finest': Biden's DOJ Secretly Targeted Trump's Inner Circle Authored by Matt Margolis via PJMedia.com, There are new, disturbing revelations about the weaponization of the federal government against former Trump officials that demand attention. Just weeks before returning to the White House, officials who served President Donald Trump during his first term discovered they had been swept up in a politically charged dragnet under orders from the Biden administration. Google, following a legal process that the FBI triggered, quietly collected personal information from their accounts, only alerting the targets after the fact, and only because the court-imposed gag order had finally lifted. Dan Scavino, now White House Deputy Chief of Staff, received one of these anonymous yet chilling notifications from Google. “Google received and responded to a legal process issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation compelling the release of information related to your Google account. A court order previously prohibited Google from notifying you of the legal process…” The Orwellian undertone cannot be missed. Scavino described it as “Biden lawfare” in action, calling it “a small taste of the INSANITY that many of us went through—right here in the United States of America. LAWFARE at its finest. A Complete and Total Disgrace!!!!!” Imagine patriotically and proudly serving in the first Trump White House for four years, and departing in January of 2021 . . . Then, during the four years you're out, BIDEN LAWFARE kicks in, and you receive the below email five weeks before re-entering the White House again in… — Dan Scavino Jr.🇺🇸🦅 (@DanScavino) August 1, 2025 According to Fox News Digital, soon after Scavino’s post, Kash Patel, who now serves as FBI Director, revealed he too received one of these covert warnings. This wasn’t a one-off; this was a coordinated campaign of intimidation. Jeff Clark, acting administrator at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, also stepped forward, stating he got a similar message. “Indeed, a whole Jack Smith team was assigned to go through my emails after there was a privilege review.” Clark didn’t stop there; he exposed how the “group of lawyers ignored my religious pastor privilege, marital privilege, and other privileges and basically shipped all they could to Jack Smith. But it still cost me tens of thousands to try to protect my communications.” Smith, the former special counsel whom Merrick Garland handpicked, got the green light to relentlessly pursue Donald Trump and his allies through a series of politically charged investigations. His mandate? To criminalize Trump’s efforts to challenge the highly questionable 2020 election results and, later, to go after him over the possession of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, despite a long history of former officials handling such matters without prosecution. Smith’s team rolled through personal data with utter disregard for privacy and protected communication. “My medical records and other private communications had nothing to do with the 2020 election,” Clark said. “They were no one's business. But it didn't matter to these thugs with law degrees and the willingness to abuse government power.” This was vengeance dressed up in legal jargon. And once again, we’re staring down undeniable proof that under Biden’s watch, the law wasn’t blind; it was a weapon aimed squarely at his political enemies. The administration didn't treat the Constitution as a safeguard but as an obstacle to ignore. Those who dared to challenge the regime were met not with due process, but with the full force of a weaponized federal machine. This is the legacy of the Left’s “justice”: intimidate, isolate, and destroy. Stunned by this chilling government overreach? You’re not alone—these revelations highlight how far the Left will go to silence dissent. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 14:05",
