    "fullContent": "Coffee Analyst Warns Brazil Frost Could Deliver \"Death Blow\" To 2026 Harvest Maja Wallengren, Danish-born independent coffee market reporter and founder of SpillingTheBean, reports that severe frost has struck key coffee-producing areas in Brazil, including the entire Cerrado Mineiro region and parts of Southern Minas. Wallengren warned that this \"frost damage\" event could be the \"death blow\" to the 2026 harvest, with production estimates now around 54 to 58 million bags versus prior estimates near 70% of capacity. Given Brazil's position as the world's largest coffee producer, adverse weather conditions represent a potentially bullish catalyst for coffee futures in New York and warrant close market monitoring. Brazil @coffee lands across Minas Gerais including all top regions from Southern Minas to Alta Mogiana and the Cerrado already have been hammered by three intense cold fronts this year, and as I have tried to explain here MANY times even if the physical damage has not been… https://t.co/qkO4K4tu0e pic.twitter.com/sKZe8z9m81 — Maja Wallengren (@SpillingTheBean) August 9, 2025 Some talk again about #frost to Brazil #Coffee . However, in my 40 years of experience in this business, only twice in 100 years has there been a frost this late in August that caused crop damage & Coffee grown further north. High pressure (1024 MB) needs to be closer to Minas… pic.twitter.com/93M3642GuI — WeatherWealth Commodity Newsletter (@ClimatePredict) August 10, 2025 Here's the report from Wallengren, which was first published on X: BREAKING #KC BRAZIL FROST DAMAGE continues to be confirmed across ALL of Cerrado Mineiro #coffee region, and also across MANY municipalities in Southern Minas and parts of SP/AM, and REPEATING as @SpillingTheBean has said MANY TIMES over the last month, even if the physical and visible damage to coffee trees, farms and regions may appear to be less right now than the July-2021 frosts four years ago, the STRESS IMPACT on trees and farms ahead of the 2026 flowering is MASSIVELY more severe now than four years ago, as most Brazilian coffee growers have NOT YET RECOVERED from the last 5 years of non-stop weather disasters, and the ENTIRE BRAZIL arabica coffee park is SEVERELY weakened and fragile compared to 4 years ago, hence the 2026 harvest was already SEVERELY compromised to a max crop potential of 70% BEFORE the latest and ongoing COLD FRONT and FROST started to move across the main MG coffee belt and this current frost development is THE DEATH BLOW to the 2026 harvest which in VERY BEST case scenario at this point will be able to produce a MAX of 54M-58M bags !! *BREAKING #KC BRAZIL FROST DAMAGE continues to be confirmed across ALL of Cerrado Mineiro #coffee region, and also across MANY municipalities in Southern Minas and parts of SP/AM, and REPEATING as @SpillingTheBean has said MANY TIMES over the last month, even if the physical and… https://t.co/qsdgPNBqgi pic.twitter.com/bAwtmtawH6 — Maja Wallengren (@SpillingTheBean) August 12, 2025 The Cerrado Mineiro region is a major coffee-growing area in Brazil, but its contribution to global coffee output is relatively small. Here's how it breaks down: The Cerrado Mineiro region produces about 5 million bags of coffee annually. Brazil, as a country, supplies around 35 to 40% of the world's coffee. Brazil's total output is around 64 million bags (based on around 37% share of about 60 million bags of global production). So, Cerrado Mineiro probably accounts for about 7 to 8% of Brazil's coffee, which corresponds to roughly 2 to 3% of global coffee production. Commenters on Wallengren's post expressed surprise that coffee futures showed little reaction to the news. September arabica coffee in New York traded flat. Will it take a few days for coffee desks to digest the problem? Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 02:45",

    "fullContent": "Birth Rate Among Refugee Women In Austria Nearly Triple That Of Native-Born Austrians Authored by Thomas Brooke via Remix News, New figures show that women from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq living in Austria have an average birth rate almost three times higher than that of Austrian-born women, according to data from the country’s Statistical Yearbook on Migration and Integration. The report finds that Austrian-born women have an average of 1.22 children. Among women not born in Austria, the figure rises to 1.57. However, the figure among some countries of origin rises significantly. Those born in the former Yugoslavia average 1.94 children, while Turkish-born women have 1.8 children. The highest rates are found among Syrian, Afghan, and Iraqi women, who average 3.3 children each. 🇦🇹🤰 Syrian, Afghan, and Iraqi refugees living in Austria are having almost three times as many children as Austrian-born women, according to data from the country’s Statistical Yearbook on Migration and Integration. pic.twitter.com/excbpff5Hl — Remix News & Views (@RMXnews) August 11, 2025 The report notes that Austrian mothers tend to be older when giving birth, with an average age of 30.4 years for Austrian-born women compared to 28.7 years for non-Austrian-born women. Women from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq have their first child at an average age of 26.2 years. These figures come amid ongoing debate in Austria about the demographic impact of migration since the large influx of refugees from Syria in recent years. At CPAC Hungary in May, the leader of the Austrian Freedom Party, Herbert Kickl, claimed that mass immigration to Europe is an agenda that is organized as “a consciously controlled ethnic and cultural transformation.” Austria's FPÖ leader @Herbert_Kickl at #CPACHungary2025: \"What is happening in Europe is no coincidence. It is the result of an agenda, a consciously controlled ethnic and cultural transformation. Migration is not being stopped, it is being organized, promoted, and glorified.\" pic.twitter.com/RHbYaMn1oG — Remix News & Views (@RMXnews) May 29, 2025 “What is happening in Europe is no coincidence. It is the result of an agenda, a consciously controlled ethnic and cultural transformation. Because migration is not being stopped, no, it is being organized, promoted, and glorified,” he told attendees. A new generation with a growing Muslim population is having a profound effect in Austria, particularly in education. In October 2024, federal data revealed that more than three-quarters of students in Vienna’s middle schools do not speak German at home, putting pressure on an education system designed for single-language learning. A survey at the same time by the local teachers’ union at some of Vienna’s 100 compulsory schools revealed not only systematic issues like language barriers, but also extreme incidents, including assaults on teachers, situations where parents of schoolchildren asked a teacher to wear a burqa, and even the presence of mock executions. It has led to teachers leaving their profession — 20 a day on average in 2024 — and other educators speaking out on the “rapid Islamization” of the Austrian capital. “Islam is changing our society in ways we do not want,” said longtime principal of a Vienna middle school, Christian Klar, in an interview with Christian magazine Corrigenda last year. A December 2024 report from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution also unveiled disturbing trends in the Islamist radicalization of young girls in Upper Austria. To mitigate the strain that mass immigration is having on schools, Education Minister Christoph Wiederkehr announced in March orientation classes designed to prepare migrant children for the Austrian school environment. He noted how many of these students not only do not speak any German but are also unfamiliar with basic literacy and numeracy. Some have never held a pen or followed structured school rules, and many fail to show respect for female teachers due to cultural differences. Read more here... Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 02:00",
