    "fullContent": "Italian Police Arrest 13 In Nationwide Crackdown On Chinese Mafia Groups Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Italian police arrested 13 people in a nationwide sweep against Chinese organized crime groups, striking what authorities called a “double blow” to criminal networks accused of drug trafficking, labor and sex exploitation, and money laundering. An Italian State Police officer looks on at a checkpoint in Milan on March 10, 2020. Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images Multiple coordinated operations conducted across a total of 25 provinces, including Milan, Rome, Florence, Prato, and Catania, targeted Chinese clans operating with mafia‑style intimidation and territorial control, according to a statement from the Interior Ministry and remarks by anti-organized crime police official Andrea Olivadese. “On one front, the State Police carried out a ‘high‑impact’ action in 24 Italian provinces targeting entrenched Chinese criminal groups engaged in illegal trafficking, exploitation of prostitution and labor, product counterfeiting, drug dealing, and international money laundering,” the Interior Ministry said in a statement. Hundreds of commercial businesses and vehicles were inspected, with more than 1,900 potential suspects identified, it added. Alongside the arrests, police seized 550 grams—about 5,500 doses—of crystal methamphetamine known locally as “shabu,” as well as weapons and cash, Olivadese said. Another 31 people were reported to judicial authorities but not taken into custody. Another operation, led by the Guardia di Finanza, dismantled a $3.9‑billion tax‑fraud ring, seizing $858 million, closing 266 shell companies, and freezing 400 bank accounts across the regions of Marche, Lombardy, and Piedmont, the Interior Ministry said. “These coordinated actions show that Chinese mafia activity is not just a local issue but a transnational criminal reality capable of moving billions and infiltrating the economic fabric,” Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said in the ministry’s statement. He praised the “exemplary professionalism and determination” of investigators in protecting the “honest citizens and economic health of the country.” The crackdown comes amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese influence in Italy, including investigations into “overseas police stations” operated by Chinese authorities. Human rights group Safeguard Defenders reported in 2022 that Italy hosts the highest number of these clandestine centers—11 in total—in cities such as Rome, Milan, Venice, Florence, Sicily, and Prato. Italian officials have denied authorizing the centers and pledged increased monitoring. Piantedosi said in December 2022 that sanctions would follow if any illegality was confirmed. Italy previously participated in joint patrols with Chinese police, but those were terminated in 2022 amid concerns about Beijing’s human rights record and the potential misuse of such facilities to surveil dissidents of the Chinese regime. The Italian Parliament’s Anti‑Mafia Commission has also expanded its remit to investigate Chinese organized crime and alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Analysts, including former NATO Defense College Foundation Director Giuseppe Morabito, have warned that Chinese gangs in Europe often operate in symbiosis with state‑linked actors, blurring the line between organized crime and foreign influence. The Italian operations follow years of investigations into underground Chinese banking networks accused of funneling billions of euros from counterfeit goods, prostitution, and tax evasion back to China. International reporting has also highlighted Chinese organized crime’s reach beyond Europe. A joint investigation by ProPublica and The Frontier in 2024 described links between Chinese diplomats and organized crime figures in the United States, while other studies have traced the role of Chinese triads in supplying Mexican cartels with precursor chemicals for fentanyl. Ben Liang, Olivia Li, and Reuters contributed to this report. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 07:20",

(Shutterstock) According to Banxico, Mexico's national bank, remittances from the United States have fallen by nearly 6% since January, and 16.2% during the month of June - when only $5.2 billion was sent back to Mexico, vs $6.207 billion in the same month in 2024. And while the bank reports that the average amount being sent back is higher than in 2024 at $409, the number of people sending money back has dropped by 14%. Executives at Western Union recently admitted on an earnings call that the outflow of hot money from the United States has slowed amid the crackdown on illegal aliens. CFO Matt Cagwin told Wall Street analysts that they \"continued to see weakness in North America, driven by immigration policy, which led to a slowdown in the independent channel.\" CEO Devin McGranahan explained that the \"slowdown\" is in both retail and digital businesses between the United States and Mexico. Over the past year, nearly $63 billion was sent back to Mexico by people living north of the border - a significant drop from the peak years of 2023 and 2024. Illegals sent $56 billion dollars back to their home countries just in the year 2024 $56 BILLION was sent out of America while they received free housing, healthcare, food etc This has been the scam of illegals for decades. Collect our benefits while building a life in Mexico pic.twitter.com/DWGgd84ROW — Wall Street Apes (@WallStreetApes) June 23, 2025 \"Remittances plummeted in June due to low job creation for Mexicans in the United States and the fear of migrants to go out due to the possibility of being deported,\" Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis at Banco Base, wrote on X on Friday, adding that \"remittances could continue to decline for the rest of the year, affecting consumption in Mexico.\" As we noted on Friday, there has been an unprecedented purge of illegal alien workers in the United States. In July, the number of foreign born workers tumbled by 467K. It wasn't just July though: as shown below, foreign-born workers (which, again, are mostly illegal aliens) have declined four months in a row... Analysts, meanwhile, think remittances could continue to fall throughout the second half of the year. Analysts from the banks Banorte, BBVA, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan also believe there is a risk that remittances will continue to decline in the second half of 2025, according to the newspaper El Economista. Such an eventuality would affect millions of Mexican families that depend on remittances to meet their basic needs. It would also affect the Mexican economy, reducing consumption and thus contributing to what is widely forecast to be a lower level of growth in 2025. -MexicoNewsDaily The vast majority of remittances to Mexico are sent from the United States - which will impose a 1% tax on cash sent starting Jan. 1, 2026 - which has prompted the Mexican government to promote a government bank card that can avoid US-based Mexicans to avoid the tax. Immigrants are leaving US workforce in mass. Remittance payments US→MX plummeting, down over -2 million from a year ago. Biggest decline by far in 30+ years - a period that includes a homebuilding depression and a 100-year financial crisis. pic.twitter.com/o49TeyLvOC — Eric Finnigan (@EricFinnigan) August 3, 2025 99% of money transfers were done electronically, while the rest were done via cash or money transfers according to Banxico, as reported by Border Report. According to Jesús Cervantes González, director of economic statistics at the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, \"there are indicators that show a weakening of employment for Mexican immigrant workers in the United States,\" MexicoNewsDaily reports. \"That could be due both to a genuine decrease in demand for such workers and to their irregular presence at their workplaces out of fear of being deported,\" he said. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been carrying out immigration raids in various US cities this year - including a major operation in Los Angeles in June - with President Trump pledging to carry out the \"largest deportation operation in US history.\" Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 06:55",

That’s even as the latest economic data suggests the US economy is grappling with the fallout. “We’ll be putting a initially small tariff on pharmaceuticals, but in one year — one and a half years, maximum — it’s going to go to 150% and then it’s going to go to 250% because we want pharmaceuticals made in our country,” Trump said Tuesday in the interview on CNBC.
