    "summary": "This paper studies how firms’ ownership choices and workers’ intrinsic motivation jointly shape service quality and market outcomes in labor-intensive, mission-driven sectors. Two organizations first choose whether to operate as standard for-profit or as mission-oriented firms, and then compete in both the labor and the user markets. Mission-oriented firms have higher unit costs but attract better-motivated workers. Service quality is endogenously determined through the sorting of intrinsically motivated workers and depends on the firm's ownership type. We show that all market structures — standard, mission-oriented, or mixed — can arise in equilibrium, and that mixed structures can be Pareto superior by efficiently allocating the most motivated workers to the mission-oriented firm while preserving the cost advantage of the other firm. While equilibrium outcomes generally diverge from the social optimum due to externalities and lack of coordination, they are both driven by the trade-of",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20479",
    "summary": "This paper explores a repositioning of Europe’s labor market institutions as potential drivers of the transatlantic gap in macroeconomic performance. Institutional diagnoses were prominent in times of high European unemployment in the 1980-90s. But interest waned as joblessness fell—even though the decline was uneven, precarious work arrangements have grown, and labor markets remain largely unreformed (unlike product and financial markets). Yet, rigid labor market institutions might continue to matter because they can stifle labor market and business dynamism: Europeans switch jobs much less frequently, and restructuring is much rarer. Recent research argues that such immobility impedes wage and productivity growth. Moreover, this low dynamism might contribute to Europe’s specific underperformance in tech, R&D, disruptive innovation, ICT adoption—where creative destruction requires fluid reallocation. This institutional labor market perspective on European competitiveness complements p",

    "summary": "We present new evidence on the impact of fiscal variables on long-term interest rates and term premia in the United States. To alleviate endogeneity problems, we follow the seminal methodology by Laubach (2009) and resort to long-term projections of interest rates and fiscal variables. After incorporating an additional 20 years of data into our sample, the estimated effects of debt and deficits on interest rates show little change from Laubach’s findings. However, we show that the link between long-term rates and fiscal variables is not stable over time. It was close to zero during the years of relative fiscal prudence around the turn of the century and it has been increasing since fiscal positions have started to deteriorate markedly",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20477",
    "summary": "This paper presents micro-empirical evidence on the effects of wage-setting decentralization. Our setting is Italy, where employers are required to comply with occupation- and industry-specific wage floors set by national collective bargaining agreements. We show that opting out of these agreements reduces wages but increases workers’ employment and retention within firms. These effects are most pronounced in the more productive North, where the overall impact on workers’ earnings is slightly positive. In contrast, in the South, wage losses outweigh employment gains, leading to a net decline in earnings. We also find that increased wage-setting flexibility is associated with higher firm survival rates in both regions. The regional divergence in outcomes aligns with a monopsony framework in which productivity and labor supply elasticities vary spatially.",

So let’s take a look at two of my favorite labor indicators: real average hourly wages and real aggregate payrolls for nonsupervisory workers.First, here are real average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers:These were unchanged in June. Nominally wages increased 0.3% in June, but so did consumer inflation, so the net was zero. The upward trend in these since July 2022 (when gas prices backed off from $5/gallon due to the Ukraine war) remains intact.Here is the long term YoY% look:Real hourly wages have increased. 1.2% in the 12 months. With a few exceptions, for the past two years they have increased between 1.0% and 1.7% YoY. More importantly, with the exception of the 2001 and COVID recessions, real hourly wages have always been negative YoY by the onset of the downturn.

In an advisory about the SharePoint security hole, a.k.a.

The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) concurred, saying CVE-2025-53770 is a variant on a flaw Microsoft patched earlier this month (CVE-2025-49706). Microsoft notes the weakness applies only to SharePoint Servers that organizations use in-house, and that SharePoint Online and Microsoft 365 are not affected. The Washington Pos",
