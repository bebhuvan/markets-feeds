    "fullContent": "IDF Chief Clashes With Netanyahu Over Full Permanent Takeover Of Gaza Strip The Israeli military's (IDF) chief of staff, Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir, reportedly sharply disagreed with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a three hour security cabinet meeting Wednesday, where the question of what's next in Gaza was hotly debated. Zamir presented various options, after widespread reports that Netanyahu is ready to pull the trigger on the full conquest and permanent occupation of the Gaza Strip, even if this endangers the remaining living hostages. IDF chief of staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir, via Creative Commons An official statement from Netanyahu's office said the prime minister \"held a closed security consultation that lasted about three hours, during which the Chief of Staff presented various options for continuing the military campaign in Gaza.\" Kan News public broadcaster subsequently stated \"The prime minister's direction is to go and conquer the Gaza Strip.\" However, Zamir is said to have pushed back, saying \"You are entering a trap in Gaza,\" Kan reported. The conquest plan would see IDF ground forces move into new areas where the hostages are believed held, but the army chief of staff argued that this \"will significantly endanger their lives and cause the army to burn out.\" The IDF has been fighting hard for nearly two years, and there have been hundreds of casualties - in the wake of the Hamas/PIJ terror attacks of Oct.7, 2023. Despite likely tens of thousands of Hamas militants having been killed over the course of the war, they have still proven effective in small ambushes against IDF forces, emerging from the tunnels to strike. Netanyahu reportedly shot back during the meeting that \"until now, the IDF's modus operandi has not led to a deal for hostages and their release, therefore, a different action is required. Hamas will understand that it has no immunity and will reach a deal.\" Reports say that Zamir is opting for a strategy of encirclement and targeted raids, largely in continuation of what's happening now, in order to continue grinding down and exhausting the remaining Hamas fighters. Zamir is reportedly ready to carry out whatever the cabinet ultimately decides, and a follow-up Thursday cabinet meeting will feature a vote. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 05:45",

    "fullContent": "Four NATO States Agree To Buy $1 Billion In US Weapons For Ukraine Via The Libertarian Institute Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands announced they would buy $1 billion in weapons for Ukraine from the US. Copenhagen is pledging to buy $500 million in arms that will be matched by the three Scandinavian countries. “Ukraine is not only fighting for its own security, but also for our security,” Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson. Source: DVIDS The Wall Street Journal reports this is the first of several weapon sales to Ukraine paid for by NATO members this summer. NATO and President Donald Trump recently unveiled a scheme to send Ukraine $10 billion in US weapons funded by Europe and Canada. However, several European countries have announced they will not participate in the program. The WSJ report makes mention of Kyiv's shopping list: NATO and Ukraine have established a shopping list of Kyiv’s requirements for lethal and nonlethal equipment, dubbed the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List. NATO, Ukraine and NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, U.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, will ensure the packages meet Kyiv’s needs. NATO is dividing the list into packages valued at roughly $500 million apiece Governments are making financial commitments toward the packages and NATO, which has pledged “rapid delivery from U.S. stockpiles” will coordinate delivery of the arms to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelensky celebrated the announcement. \"We already have commitments from the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark – over one billion dollars for American weapons that Ukraine will receive,\" he wrote on X. \"Thank you! This cooperation with NATO countries will continue.\" The Ukrainian leader also said he had a \"productive\" conversation with President Donald Trump. Zelensky says he spoke with Trump about adding new sanctions on Russia. According to Reuters the scheme also allows for countries that donate weapons to Ukraine to have priority access to receiving replacement arms from the US. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 05:00",
