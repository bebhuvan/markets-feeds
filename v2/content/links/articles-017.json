    "fullContent": "Here is an NBER paper from May that I do not think I covered: We evaluate the aggregate effects of a change in tariffs on the US and world economies when tariff revenue is used to enact fiscal reform. Our model combines a standard international model of fiscal policy with taxes and a dynamic model of trade participation and tariffs that allows for uncertainty and transitions. We consider effects of permanent and temporary tariffs–with and without retaliation–when tariff revenue is used to reduce taxes on capital or labor or to subsidize investment. Compared to a lump sum redistribution, using tariff revenue for these reforms always boosts economic activity. Key to our analysis is the effect of trade dynamics on import substitution, such that tariff revenue after an increase in tariffs is higher in the short run than in the long run. When increasing the tariff by 20 percentage points, the revenue raised is largest when tariffs are temporary, unilateral, and used to subsidize investment,",
