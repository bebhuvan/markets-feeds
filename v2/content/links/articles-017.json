The Canyon Fire, impacting Southern California’s Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, has consumed an estimated 4,856 acres and remains uncontained, prompting evacuations.

Evacuation orders have been issued for six zones across Los Angeles County, including Val Verde, Hasley Canyon, and Castaic, as well as four areas in Ventura County, including Lake Piru Recreation Area and communities east of Piru. Eight additional areas are under evacuation warnings. The #CanyonFire continues to burn and our first responders are on the front lines protecting communities.

If you're in Santa Clarita, Hasley Canyon, or Val Verde, take evacuation orders seriously — when first responders say GO, leave immediately. Keep aware—please don't risk lives.\" My view of the Canyon Fire. Keeping all involved in my prayers. pic.twitter.com/XJz7AkxyNg — Lost in the Burbs (@lostintheburbs) August 8, 2025 This latest blaze comes just six months after January's wildfires ravaged the Palisades. Displaced residents are now fighting back, filing a lawsuit against the L.A. Department of Water and Power for failing to follow its own policy, then allegedly changing that policy and altering computer records to cover up a more than four-hour delay in cutting power to the Pacific Palisades on Jan. 7. \"They're altering records. They're denying things that can't be denied,\" said Michael Valentine, who lost his home in the Palisades Fire, adding, \"You know, it seems to be that they're doing everything they can to get out from responsibility... It's beyond shocking. It's actually quasi-criminal.\" Related: Another 'Conspiracy Theory' Comes True: California Bill Passes To Buy Fire-Ravaged Palisades For Low-Income Apartments $100 Million In Palisades Relief Disappears In Democratic Party's NGO Network How Things Stand 6 Months After Palisades Fire . . .
