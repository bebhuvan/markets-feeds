    "fullContent": "P'Nut The Squirrel's Owners Sue New York For $10M After Raid, Decapitation The owners P'Nut - a beloved squirrel that was seized and euthanized by the state of New York are suing for $10 million in damages over the death of their pets, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday in New York Court of Claims. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation staged a five-hour raid on the home of Mark Luongo after an anonymous complaint was lodged against the P'nuts Freedom Farm, where internet sensation Peanut the squirrel was taken into custody along with his sidekick, Fred the raccoon - before the state euthanized both animals 'in order to test for rabies.' DEC officials claimed that P'Nut but an agent through thick leather gloves during the raid, necessitating both the squirrel and raccoon be decapitated and tested for rabies. The state later admitted that both tests were negative, and have never apologized nor returned the bodies of the pets. According to court documents, P'Nut and Fred's execution were \"not due to a fear of rabies,\" but a \"senseless act of violence\" and \"obscene demonstration of government abuse.\" This lawsuit comes on top of a previous suit filed by Longo and Bittner on June 27 in Chemung County Supreme Court against the City of Elmira and 36 individuals from various levels of state and local office - and seeks unspecified damages via jury trial. The couple claims they've suffered emotional trauma and financial losses since losing their star squirrel - who had appeared all over social media (including OnlyFans !?), according to both lawsuits. NEW: The owner of Peanut the squirrel explains how New York officials raided his house, took Peanut and his raccoon, and k*lled them. 7-year-old Peanut and Fred the raccoon were euthanized after anonymous complaints. “Officers raided my house as if I was a drug dealer.

I’m sorry I failed you but thank you for everything,\" Longo wrote in a post announcing Peanut's death. A Connecticut native, Longo moved to Elmira, NY in 2023 to start the Freedom Farm, a 501.C.3 approved nonprofit. \"Last year we moved to NY in hopes of starting a NONPROFIT animal rescue in PNUT’s Name. [P’Nuts Freedom Farm] will forever live in PNUT’s memory,\" Longo wrote in a post announcing the seizure late last year. \"With over 350 rescues, we’ve relied heavily on PNUT and his internet family to father donations to help more animals. I don’t even know how will [sic] continue to fundraise for this nonprofit.\" The organization is made up of veterinarians and caregivers who rescue animals from abusive or dire situations.

    "fullContent": "IRS Announces No Changes To Withholding Tables, Information Return Forms For 2025 Authored by Naveen Athrappully via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), There will be no changes to individual information returns or withholding tables for the 2025 tax year while the IRS implements the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) in a phased manner, the agency said in an Aug. 7 statement. The IRS building in Washington on July 21, 2025. Madalina Kilroy/The Epoch Times Information returns are documents that businesses must file with the IRS, reporting transactions such as wages paid to employees. The IRS’s withholding tables describe how much an employer must withhold from an employee’s paycheck for taxes, Social Security, and Medicare. The OBBB was signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 and included certain provisions related to taxes. The IRS clarified that information return forms such as forms W-2, 1099, and 941 “will remain unchanged” for tax year 2025. The federal income tax withholding tables will not be updated with OBBB provisions, the agency said. “These decisions are intended to avoid disruptions during the tax filing season and to give the IRS, business, and tax professionals enough time to implement the changes effectively,” the agency said. The IRS asked employers and payroll providers to continue using existing procedures when it comes to reporting and withholding taxes. As for tax year 2026, the IRS said it was working to update forms and develop new guidance. The new changes will include how overtime pay and tips are reported. The IRS said it plans to coordinate with payroll providers, tax professionals, and employers to ensure a smooth transition to the new rules. Although there is no change in information returns or withholding tables, the OBBB has multiple provisions providing tax relief for Americans effective this year. For one, the OBBB eliminates taxes on tips, according to a July 14 statement from the IRS. Employees and self-employed individuals can deduct tips from their tax returns, provided their occupations are listed by the IRS as customarily receiving tips. The IRS must publish a list of these occupations by Oct. 2. The maximum annual deduction allowed in this case is $25,000, which phases out for taxpayers whose modified adjusted gross income is more than $150,000. Secondly, the OBBB eliminates taxes on overtime. “Individuals who receive qualified overtime compensation may deduct the pay that exceeds their regular rate of pay,” the IRS said. The maximum overtime deduction for a taxpayer is $12,500 per annum, which is phased out as income rises. To claim the deduction, taxpayers are required to include their Social Security numbers on their tax returns. Married individuals must file jointly to claim the deduction. For joint filers, it goes up to $25,000. Third, the car loan interest tax has been canceled by the OBBB. “Individuals may deduct interest paid on a loan used to purchase a qualified vehicle, provided the vehicle is purchased for personal use and meets other eligibility criteria,” the IRS said, adding that lease payments do not qualify for this benefit. To be considered a qualified deduction, the interest must be on a loan that originated after Dec. 31, 2024. The vehicle must have undergone final assembly in the United States. Fourth, Americans aged 65 and older can claim a tax deduction of $6,000, which is in addition to the existing standard deduction for this demographic. The deduction phases out for seniors with a modified adjusted gross income of more than $75,000. These four tax relief provisions are effective from 2025 through 2028. Rising Tax Collections, New Commissioner For fiscal year 2024, which ran from Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2024, the IRS collected more than $5.1 trillion in revenues, a roughly 9 percent increase from the previous fiscal year. This was the first time that the agency’s collections crossed the $5 trillion mark. “The IRS processed more than 266 million returns and other forms from individuals, businesses, and tax-exempt organizations; received almost 4.6 billion information returns; and issued close to $553 billion in refunds to individual and business taxpayers during FY 2024,” the agency said. The IRS is slated to get a new chief after Trump replaced commissioner Billy Long, a White House official told The Epoch Times. Long was confirmed to the post less than two months ago. Long said he will now act as U.S. ambassador to Iceland. “It is [an] honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland,” Long said in an Aug. 8 post on social media platform X. “I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as acting commissioner of the IRS. Andrew Moran contributed to this report. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 20:55",

    "fullContent": "Security Expert Reveals Hacker Could Remote Control Cars Through Major Automaker's 'Dealership Portal' In a shocking cyber security incident that should terrify every American, a top security researcher has revealed how he gained \"unfettered access\" to a major carmaker's dealership portal - potentially allowing hackers to remotely hijack any customer vehicle from anywhere in the world. Eaton Zveare, a security researcher at software delivery company Harness, made the alarming disclosure to TechCrunch, explaining how the devastating flaw could have enabled cybercriminals to access victims' personal and financial data, track their vehicles in real-time, and even seize complete control of vehicles from any location globally. While Zveare refused to name the vulnerable automaker, he confirmed it's a popular car company operating multiple brands under its corporate umbrella, meaning millions of Americans could have been at risk. TechCrunch reports: Zveare, who has found bugs in carmakers’ customer systems and vehicle management systems before, found the flaw earlier this year as part of a weekend project, he told TechCrunch. He said while the security flaws in the portal’s login system was a challenge to find, once he found it, the bugs let him bypass the login mechanism altogether by permitting him to create a new “national admin” account. The flaws were problematic because the buggy code loaded in the user’s browser when opening the portal’s login page, allowing the user — in this case, Zveare — to modify the code to bypass the login security checks. \"No one even knows that you're just silently looking at all of these dealers' data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,\" Zveare told the news outlet in his explosive interview. The researcher demonstrated the hack's terrifying potential, explaining: \"For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that. But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind-of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.\" \"They're just security nightmares waiting to happen,\" he added, highlighting the industry-wide vulnerabilities that could leave American families exposed to cyber attacks. Fortunately, the carmaker acted swiftly after being notified, with Zveare confirming that the critical vulnerabilities were patched within one week in February 2025. \"The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it's always related to authentication,\" said Zveare. \"If you're going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.\" The revelation underscores the growing threat of cyber warfare targeting America's critical infrastructure, raising serious questions about whether our automotive industry is doing enough to protect Americans from hackers.

    "fullContent": "Ant Group Denies Rumors Of Plans For Rare-Earth-Backed Stablecoins With PBoC Authored by Cailan Quinn via Decrypt.co, Chinese tech giant Ant Group has denied online rumors that it is working with the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to launch a rare earth-backed RMB stablecoin. The company said over the weekend that several articles had misled investors by suggesting the project was in development. \"Ant Group has never had such plans with relevant institutions. The public is advised to pay attention and beware of being deceived,\" it wrote on Weibo Sunday night. The denial comes amid a wave of interest from Chinese companies in stablecoin technology as other countries shore up their regulations. The interest, for now, is strictly international and not targeting domestic audiences. Chinese regulators sent out guidance to brokerages last month to cool off on publishing research and making public comments related to stablecoins amid concerns it was renewing domestic interest in cryptocurrencies. Crypto trading is banned in China due to fears about financial regulation and economic stability. Edwin Cheung, CEO of Gate Dubai and a former executive at Gate HK, told Decrypt he has seen strong enthusiasm from mainland Chinese companies with international arms for Hong Kong’s stablecoin regime. “A lot of e-commerce firms, they’re super energetic about the Hong Kong regime,” he said. “They want to leverage on this regime, either to do their own stablecoin or use stablecoin technology or blockchain technology in their own payment network within their business.” Ant Group and blockchain Ant Group itself has active blockchain projects, including plans to integrate Circle’s USDC stablecoin into its blockchain platform once the token achieves full compliance in the U.S. under the GENIUS Act. It was also considering launching stablecoins backed by the Hong Kong dollar. Other major Chinese firms are moving in the same direction. JD.com said in June it plans to seek stablecoin licenses in multiple countries to reduce the cost and time of cross-border payments. The e-commerce giant aims to start with business-to-business transactions before expanding to consumer use. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 20:05",

    "fullContent": "\"We'll Take Half World Down With Us\": India Outraged By Pak Army Chief's Nuke Threats From US Soil Pakistan’s Army Chief, General Asim Munir, has been on a tour of the United States over several days, which included attendance at a farewell function for the chief of the US Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla. The trip is said to be Gen. Munir's second visit in less than two months. While in Tampa (where CENTCOM's HQ base is located), Gen. Munir also spoke at a private event for the Pakistani diaspora in America. His words there have set off outrage and condemnation from India on Monday, including fresh nuclear sabre-rattling. \"We are a nuclear power. If we go down, we’ll take half the world with us,\" Munir reportedly had stated. What has heightened the anger in New Delhi is that this is the first time a top Pakistani official has issued an apparent nuclear threat from US soil. Pakistan’s Army Chief, General Asim Munir, file image. Munir also threatened to target infrastructure projects India might build on the Indus River, amid the recent conflict and diplomatic standoff over historic water rights treaties. Referring to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack of last April, he claimed it could lead to famine for 250 million people. \"Let them build a dam, and we’ll hit it with ten missiles,\" he was quoted as saying, adding, \"We have no shortage of missiles, al-hamdulillah [praise be to God].\" He also during the speech called India a shiny Mercedes, compared to \"dump truck\" Pakistan - in reference to military stregnth and impact: \"India is shining, a Mercedes coming on a highway like a Ferrari, but we are a dump truck full of gravel. If the truck hits the car, who is going to be the loser?\" he said in a \"crude analogy\". The top army chief had further raised eyebrows on the question of military intervention in government affairs: \"People say war is too serious to be left to the generals, but politics is also too serious to be left to the politicians,\" he said at the disapora event. The Indian government issued a statement condemning the remarks: India on Monday accused its neighbour Pakistan of \"sabre rattling\" and \"irresponsibility\" after media reports on remarks about nuclear threats in South Asia made by Pakistan's army chief while on a visit to the United States. The statement also accused Pakistan of using nuclear saber-rattling as its \"stock-in-trade\". The two neighboring countires, who have fought several historic border wars, have both been nuclear-armed for decades - a fact which has frequently been cause for alarm for the whole south Asia region. Additionally, an Indian lawmaker, Jairam Ramesh, responded Monday by saying: \"It is bizarre that the US establishment is giving such a man such special treatment.\" The White House has not weighed in and is not expected to, but it is also of course an ally of India, and the Indian Embassy in D.C. is likely going to try and seek answers. It’s condemnable that the US has provided a platform for Pakistan’s military leader, Asim Munir, to make provocative and inflammatory statements against India. pic.twitter.com/p5lsKh54GQ — John Brittas (@JohnBrittas) August 11, 2025 The Pentagon and US intelligence have long been close to Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment, especially related to anti-USSR activities (supporting the Afghan mujahideen) in the 1980s - as well as 'counterterror' operations in the Af-Pak region from the 1990s and into the 2000s.

So starting on January 1st, 2017, any participation of him in the conspiracy is not immune.” “You’re not immune for the rest of your life as president.” “So he’ll be immune if whatever allegations against him are contained within his presidency.” “But if he’s helping to assist over that three year period that they pushed Russian collusion into 2017 and 2018, then he’s of course, he could be indicted for that.” NOW: Rudy Giuliani says Obama will invoke “presidential immunity” over the Russia Hoax investigation — but there’s one little PROBLEM that could lead to an INDICTMENT. “You’re not immune for the rest of your life as president.” America’s Mayor laid out Obama’s legal risk to… pic.twitter.com/IuFSGwAh04 — The Vigilant Fox 🦊 (@VigilantFox) August 11, 2025 Giuliani says the Supreme Court DOES NOT give ABSOLUTE immunity to a president…and Obama’s alleged crimes with the Russia coup are FAR MORE serious than Trump’s immunity case.

I think, you know, we’re all talking about an interpretation of the Supreme Court decision.” “The Supreme Court did not actually—didn’t give ABSOLUTE immunity to a president.” “And the acts alleged here are far more serious than the allegations against Trump, which were, first of all, false, but even if they were true, they weren’t nearly as serious as this.” “So I don’t know if it holds up.” NOW: Giuliani says the Supreme Court DOES NOT give ABSOLUTE immunity to a president…and Obama’s alleged crimes with the Russia coup are FAR MORE serious than Trump’s immunity case.
