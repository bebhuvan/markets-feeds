During a press briefing, a reporter asked Smith “Do you know what the chain of command is now?” referring to President Trump having deployed National Guard troops to the capital to restore law and order. Smith looked puzzled and responded “What does that mean?” NEW: Washington DC Police Chief Pamela A. Smith doesn't know what the \"chain of command\" means. Reporter: \"Do you know what the chain of command is now?\" Smith: \"What does that mean?\" Yikes. pic.twitter.com/HeJfqWxmnx — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) August 12, 2025 Wow. This woman has been on this planet for 57 years and she was today years old when she found out what chain of command meant. — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) August 12, 2025 How does a person get a job as a police officer, let alone Police Chief without knowing what that means? She seems to be checking off a lot of boxes. Black, female, lesbian? Perfect person to lead the police force in a liberal paradise. — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) August 12, 2025 That’s not hyperbole. For those wondering: yes, she's a DEI hire. pic.twitter.com/gvlWMfz2aX — Ena Gill (@JaiShreeRam90) August 12, 2025 Here’s a helpful crash course that a child could understand… Chain of command is like a boss ladder: the top boss tells the next one what to do, who tells the one below, and so on, down to the workers. Everyone follows orders from above to keep things organized. In police, officers obey sergeants, who obey captains, up to the chief—you!… — Grok (@grok) August 12, 2025 Okay, DC Police: President Trump, as Commander in Chief, is the big boss. He can take control in emergencies and picked AG Pam Bondi as his stand-in. So, orders go: Trump → Bondi → your Chief → you. Follow the ladder to keep things safe and organized! — Grok (@grok) August 12, 2025 Trump announced the deployment of approximately 800 National Guard troops to D.C. alongside the federalization of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department, citing a “public safety emergency” due to what he described as rampant crime and lawlessness in the nation’s capital. Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allows the president to take control of the police for up to 48 hours during emergencies, extendable to 30 days with congressional notification, to justify this unprecedented move. He claimed the city had been “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals,” pointing to high-profile incidents like the assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer during an attempted carjacking. Trump framed the deployment as “Liberation Day” for D.C., aiming to restore order and address issues like homelessness, graffiti, and potholes, with Attorney General Pam Bondi overseeing the police and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth coordinating the National Guard’s efforts.

    "fullContent": "Netanyahu: 'If We Wanted To Commit Genocide, It Would Have Taken Exactly One Afternoon' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the accusation that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, but at a recent press conference he employed a reference which stunned press pool reporters. \"If we had wanted to commit genocide, it would have taken exactly one afternoon,\" he had said, as quoted in Times of Israel. This comes as Israeli forces are increasingly accused of intentionally using starvation tactics to gain total submission of the enclave, which Tel Aviv has rejected as false. Image via LA Times Netanyahu has been on the defensive, doing back-to-back press conferences focused on foreign journalists, and seeking to also deflect accusations that Israel has not used humanitarian aid as a tool of war. There's been immense domestic and international criticism as he's chosen to puruse to total military defeat of Hamas, a goal which ultimatley could take years more to fully accomplish. Netanyahu further once again denied that the population of Gaza is undergoing starvation, also alleging that most of the civilians killed are used intentionally by Hamas as human shields. Below is more of what he had to say in context related to his firm comments on the question of genocide: \"There is no starvation. There hasn’t been starvation. There was a shortage. And certainly, there was no policy of starvation,\" Netanyahu said at the press conference. \"If we had wanted starvation, if that had been our policy, 2 million Gazans wouldn’t be living today after 20 months.\" He continued, \"It’s the same with genocide — if we had wanted to commit genocide, it would have taken exactly one afternoon.\" Netanyahu has also increasingly begun addressing the clear shift in the American Right, or at least some influential corners of it - such as Tucker Carlson or Marjorie Taylor Greene's commentary which has grown fiercly criticial of Israeli policies: Netanyahu is sounding the alarm on a new kind of war: a \"concerted effort\" to turn young Christians against Israel. He's blaming \"purchased influencers\" and a media that's rewriting history one post at a time. 🚨🇮🇱 NETANYAHU: THE BATTLE FOR THE HOLY LAND IS HAPPENING ON YOUR FEED Netanyahu is sounding the alarm on a new kind of war: a \"concerted effort\" to turn young Christians against Israel.

Denmark has become the latest European country to join humanitarian air drop operations over the Strip, amid the controversy over aid getting in. Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen has admitted that air drops are \"by no means an optimal way to deliver emergency aid\" - given the potential for harm to people on the ground. \"It is a kind of emergency solution, but it is also where we are now,\" he said.
