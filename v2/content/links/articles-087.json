You do not need an undergraduate degree.\" Democrats are going insane about ICE's messaging to bolster its forces - because just a few short years ago, these far-left lawmakers were trying to abolish the agency while facilitating the invasion of criminal illegal aliens. 2018. AOC mentions Kamala Harris as a supporter of her radical agenda, which at the time included abolishing ICE. Now Kamala is promising to add more agents and secure the border. Kamala is not a leader.
