    "fullContent": "What’s driving the curious performance of US equities in 2025—and what risks are flying under the radar? Christopher Shipley, Senior Vice President and Co-Chief Investment Officer at Fort Washington Investment Advisors, joins host Mike Wallberg, CFA, to unpack the geopolitical and economic currents shaping investor sentiment. From the muted market reaction to Middle East tensions and the structural tilt of US markets toward growth, to the evolving implications of tariffs and AI’s layered impact across industries, Shipley offers a clear-eyed view on where investors might find both challenges and opportunities. Listen in for his take on why value stocks are resurfacing, how housing affordability pressures could shape the macro landscape, and why small caps might be ripe for a comeback. Don’t miss this deep-dive conversation on market resilience, risk signals, and forward-looking strategies for navigating volatility.",
