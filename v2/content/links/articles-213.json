    "fullContent": "Beware The AI Industrial Complex By John deVadoss What makes an industrial complex is frontier technology, with feedback loops powerful enough to steer both markets and public policy. Economists describe five telltale traits: mutual dependency between state and suppliers; capital costs so high that only a few firms can play; standards written by insiders; external costs shifted to the public; and a strategic framing (‚Äúnational security,‚Äù ‚Äúglobal competitiveness‚Äù) that evades scrutiny. By that definition, we are witnessing the construction of an AI industrial complex, and its socioeconomic wake is already visible. The early externalities: Power and water The International Energy Agency projects that, by 2030, global data‚Äëcenter electricity demand will double to roughly 945 TWh ‚Äî a trillion watts used per hour. That is about the annual consumption of Japan. Much of that growth is traceable to AI inference and training workloads. The strain is leaking into household bills. In Virginia, Dominion Energy has requested a $10.92/month fuel‚Äërate increase for the ‚Äútypical‚Äù home customer, citing higher gas prices and PJM capacity charges driven in part by data‚Äëcenter growth. The request is still pending. Prices in PJM‚Äôs latest capacity auction cleared 22 % higher than last year; the East Coast grid operator estimates that will add between 1.5% and 5 % to retail bills beginning next summer. Electricity is only half the story. Google‚Äôs environmental report shows its hyperscale facilities used nearly 6 billion gallons of fresh water in 2024, up 8 % year‚Äëon‚Äëyear, a jump Google attributes largely to AI. The company says it ‚Äúreplenished‚Äù 64 % of that total, but the replenishment often happens far from the aquifers it drains. Out West, drought‚Äëstressed cities respond by digging deeper municipal wells or raising water rates ‚Äî expenses that never appear on a quarterly earnings call. Labor and looming AI divide: Whither the middle class? Generative AI in its first iteration targets the heart of the middle‚Äëclass office and clerical economy. Brookings finds more than 30 % of U.S. workers could see at least half of their tasks disrupted, with mid‚Äëskill professional roles most exposed. Public anxiety is tracking the data: A 2024 Governance AI survey shows about half of Americans expect AI to widen income inequality, and two‚Äëthirds want federal action to cushion job losses. The paradox: The same families paying higher utility bills may also face stagnant wages or displacement in the very sectors AI automates. Access to front‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëline models already carries a price tag ‚Äî ChatGPT Plus costs $20 a month, and enterprise ‚ÄúPro‚Äù tiers are tenfold higher. When homework help and job‚Äëapplication prep migrate behind priority tokens, the complex threatens to hard‚Äëcode a two‚Äëtier digital citizenship: seamless for those who can pay, throttled for those who cannot. The new and irreparable digital divide will be between those who know how to work with AI and those who do not. Unlike the paternalistic and naive exhortations to learn to code, this is not about coding or even about software at all ‚Äî this divide is about critical thinking, first-principles reasoning, and the ability to harness an emergent capability that can manifest both cloying sycophancy and Machiavellian deception. The predictable response: UBI, with Big AI as the adjudicator Inevitably, the drums will begin to beat across the nation for so-called universal basic income and its ilk; the state will have to devise economic mechanisms to address unemployment and the increasing replacement of both white and blue-collar jobs; but at what cost? The social contract will have to be rewritten; AI will increasingly assume the roles of fact-checker, arbiter and judge; and Big AI will loom large in the enforcement and governance of this new contract, as the state is forced to reinvent itself. ‚ÄúNeed more training data‚Äù is the cry, and intellectual property is collateral damage; we are witnessing the vestiges of the publishing industry attempting to make a quick buck as copyrights are being railroaded. History is written by winners, and it remains to be seen how the winning AI models and their trainers shape what will count as downstream history. The American spirit owes its striking characteristic to the frontier ‚Äî Americans have always shaped our environment and our tools, not the other way around. But we are at a critical juncture. Are we going to let AI shape our socioeconomic future? Are we about to voluntarily swap our frontier spirit for a gilded cage of our own making? The first meaningful step in addressing this is the rolling back of the proposed moratorium on state and local AI laws in H.R.1 (aka the ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill‚Äù). Considering the deep socio-economic impact of AI, it‚Äôs crucial that regulatory authority stays with local governments. A decentralized approach enables state-level experimentation, tailors oversight and risk management to local needs, and increases the likelihood of harnessing AI‚Äôs potential for the common good.

    "fullContent": "One Of The World's Oldest Asset Classes Just Hit Record Highs Farmland is one of the oldest asset classes, rivaling precious metals in its ability to preserve generational wealth. Unlike stocks or fiat currencies, farmland and cropland are tangible, finite, and highly productive. As the global population continues to grow and demand for healthier food intensifies, arable land per capita is shrinking due to urban sprawl and environmental degradation. This makes farmland not just a low-volatility store of value, but also a necessary hedge against rising global instability and inflationary pressures. The latest USDA Land Values 2025 Report from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reports a 4.3% increase in average farmland values, pushing prices to a record $4,350 per acre. This follows a 5% ($200) increase between 2023 and 2024 and marks the fifth straight year of gains in agricultural real estate. Cash rents for cropland also hit a new high, rising .60% to $161 per acre.
