    "fullContent": "Age-Restricted Taxi Tracking? The Absurd Consequences Of Britain's Online Safety Act Authored by Philip Leith via DailySceptic.org, I was recently travelling in the UK and, after a lot of sightseeing on foot, decided to order a taxi to go back to my hotel. I searched the internet for a local taxi firm and found one with relative ease. I called the number and went through an automated process which worked well. I managed to book a taxi quickly. The computer-generated voice told me that my taxi was on its way. I was sent a link so that I could monitor the progress of my taxi. The message also said that I would know the taxi driver’s name and the type of vehicle and registration number that was on its way. When I clicked on the link I was forwarded to this: I can’t understand why anyone would consider a link to show you the progress of a taxi that you have ordered to be age-inappropriate content. I can only assume that it is to do with the recent Online Safety Act, although coincidentally I had recently changed mobile providers, so it might purely have been that the mobile provider that I’d switched to had a different standard as to what was considered adult content. I doubt this on the basis that the company I moved to, Talkmobile, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company I had used previously, Vodafone, and, as you can see, the block was from Vodafone. Whoever has decided that this link contains age-restricted content hasn’t necessarily thought this through. Consider the scenario where a 17 year-old girl can’t get hold of her parents and it’s too far away or she does not want to walk home, so she orders a taxi through a reputable taxi service. A link is sent to her so she can see the progress of the taxi that she has ordered. Of course, she can’t open it because it’s considered age-inappropriate and, being only 17, she’s not in a position to prove that she’s over 18 and thus get the link to the taxi. Thankfully it’s rare, but we do know that there are predators out there who will look for people who are vulnerable, and it’s not difficult to spot someone who’s waiting for somebody to pick them up or waiting for a taxi, because every time a car approaches the person will look up from whatever they’re doing to see if it’s the car that’s picking them up. All it would take would be for a predator to be around at that time, pull the window down and say, “Did you call for a taxi?” and, of course, because she’s just ordered one, she believes this is her taxi, so she gets in, perhaps never to be seen again — all because some moron has decided that a link to follow the progress of a taxi is something you’re not allowed to see if you’re under the age of 18. How many other innocuous things have been blocked because of this Online Safety Act, and by doing so, are children really any safer? Tyler Durden Tue, 08/12/2025 - 06:30",

    "fullContent": "Ukrainian Population's Support For War Effort Collapses, Poll Shows There's some interesting and vital data which was released last week, just ahead of this coming Friday's historic Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, which will focuse on finding a solution to ending the Russia-Ukraine war, though the US leader has just tempered expectations by calling it a \"feel-out meeting\". Gallup released a poll last Thursday which demonstrates a dramatic shift in Ukrainian public opinion, with 69% of the population now favoring a negotiated settlement to end the grinding war as soon as possible. General war weariness has long been a feature of the conflict, which has been raging for over 540 days at this point, and has taken at least tens of thousands or possibly hundreds of thousands of lives. Many Ukrainians fled abroad during the first year, and huge amounts of people are still internally displaced in the war-ravaged country. The fresh Gallup poll found that just 24% support continuing the fight until achieving a military victory, which is a stark reversal from views held at the start of the war more than three years ago. And yet this undefined goal of 'pushing on until victory' seems to remain the Zelensky government's policy. The Ukrainian leader has shown no signs whatsoever of being willing to make significant compromise to find a lasting truce, including on territorial concessions. There was a similar Gallup survey of the Ukrianian population closer to the beginnign war, in 2022. At that early point Gallup found that 72% of Ukrainians wanted to keep fighting, while just 22% supported peace talks. But since then Russia's strategy has become clear - to use its overwhelming manpower and artillery and missile supply to steadily grind down Ukraine's dwindling manpower and resolve. It has become a war of attrition, and Russia has shown itself steady and prepared for such a long conflict. And this is probably why the same survey found that Ukrainians' hopes for swift admission into either the EU or NATO are fading. The more evident it becomes that Russia is 'winning' the war - the less that the West's political establishment wants to risk, also amid fears of potential run-up to direct confrontation between NATO and Moscow. At the same time Ukrainians' outlook on Washington has turned more negative: In reviewing the findings, Gallup offers the following conclusion... \"Support for the war effort has declined steadily across all segments of the Ukrainian population, regardless of region or demographic group.\" It continued, \"This shift comes as diplomatic efforts gain new traction. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signaled readiness for direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin...\". However, the reality remains is that neigher side has yet budged from their respective 'maximalist' conditions for truce. Tyler Durden Tue, 08/12/2025 - 05:45",
