The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate acquired just over 5 million shares in UnitedHealth, a stake which was worth $1.6 billion as of June 30 making it Berkshire's 19th largest holding. At the same time, Berkshire also liquidated its entire $1 billion stake in T-Mobile during the period. The investment in the health insurer follows multiple crises for UnitedHealth, including the shocking assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan in an execution-style murder by rabid leftist Luigi Mangione. UnitedHealth has also faced unexpected increases in medical costs. In April, it reported earnings below Wall Street estimates for the first time in more than a decade, and slashed guidance, sending the stock price plummeting. It has since replaced its CEO and announced plans to replace its chief financial officer. The disclosure of Buffett's UNH stake sent the insurer’s shares up more than 10% in after hours trading. There were several other notable changes in Berkshire's portfolio, which amounted to $258 billion as of June 30. After a three quarter pause, Buffett resumed selling his Apple stake, offloading another 20 million shares during the period, after slashing his holding of the iPhone maker by more than half last year. Yet even at 280 million shares, Berkshire’s Apple stake remains its largest equity stake by market value, despite it falling by about $9.2 billion in the three months ended June 30. Berkshire also continued trimming holdings in Bank of America, selling 21 million shares and bringing its stake down to about 8% at the end of June. Buffett started whittling down the bank investment last year, without providing any explanation for the move. Curiously, Buffett remains in largely degrossing mode, and reduced his holdings in 4 of his top 5 positions (AAPL, BAC, KO and CVX), only keeping his American Express stake unchanged. Other names that saw a reduction were Davita, Liberty Media, Capital One. Buffett also added to some of his holdings: he modestly boosted his stake in Constellation Brands and Dominos, and more than doubled his position in Pool Corp. One of Berkshire's equity bets, a stake in consumer foods giant Kraft Heinz, has been a headache for Buffett’s company. The conglomerate took a $3.8 billion impairment charge on its investment earlier this year, and kept its holding unchanged in the second quarter. Finally, while liquidating his entire $1 billion stake in TMobile, Buffett also added new positions in Nucor, DR Hodton, Lamar Advertising And Allegion. As Bloomberg notes, Berkshire boosted its investment in US homebuilders in what appears to be a bet on lower rates in the future, building its stake in Lennar and buying 1.5 million shares of D.R. Horton. The company also bought more shares of steel manufacturer Nucor Corp. Those changes were omitted in a previous filing as the company requested confidentiality. The full breakdown is below.

    "fullContent": "Mamdani's Biggest Threat To Democrats Authored by J.T. Young via RealClearPolitics, For the last 10 years, it’s been difficult for Democrats to win elections unless the campaigns center on Donald Trump. But the arrival of Zohran Mamdani on the national stage risks carrying the Democratic Party far off message – and derailing its strategy for 2026 and beyond. With his upset win in the Democratic primary, Democratic-Socialist Mamdani has the inside track in New York City’s mayoral race. New York already has a host of problems: crime, illegal immigration, high spending, high taxes, and a declining population and dwindling tax base. Mamdani’s radical policy proposals only threaten to add to these woes. Free bus service, government-run grocery stores, and government-built housing all promise to increase New York City’s already high spending. Mamdani’s commitment to increase taxes on higher income and whiter neighborhoods will increase New York City’s already high taxes. Together, the two will squeeze the city’s economy, pushing out more of the city’s population and further eroding its tax base. Mamdani’s earlier support for defunding the police and not cooperating with ICE will hike crime and illegal immigration. In sum, Mamdani threatens to accelerate the negative economic and societal spiral New York City has been experiencing for some time. It is the last thing New Yorkers need. Accentuating America’s perception of Democrat excesses in the nation’s biggest city is also the last thing Democrats need. How big a problem is this for Democrats? Such topics were among President Biden’s worst polling performances: According to Real Clear Politics’ final average of Biden’s job approval polling, Americans gave him just a 38.8% approval on his handling of the economy, 38% on crime, and 33.5% on immigration. What’s more, Mamdani, and other big-city mayors and mayoral candidates espousing radical policies, could eclipse the Democrats’ national campaign strategy of running against Trump as well. Over the last decade, Democrats’ only national election successes have come when Trump is the election’s focus. In 2018, with Trump in office, they won control of the House of Representatives. In 2020 with Trump as the incumbent, Democrats won the presidency and the Senate. Conversely in 2016, Democrats could not escape Hillary Clinton being their standard-bearer. As a result, they lost the White House in a profound political upset. In 2022, with Joe Biden in office, Democrats lost the House. In 2024, Biden and Harris were both incumbents; with reelections being referendums on incumbents, the focus was again on Democrats, and they lost the presidency. Having learned these lessons, Democrats aim to make Trump the focus in 2026 and 2028 – even without Trump on the ballot. Despite a string of policy successes, Trump remains a divisive political figure. According to RCP’s recent average of national polling, Trump’s job approval rating is just 45.9% and his favorability rating only 44.5%. Without Trump on the 2026 and 2028 ballots, Republicans must defend his divisive legacy without having the benefit of his vote-getting ability. More than a strategy, this is a necessity for Democrats. Trump is the only thing that unites them as a party. Democrats lack their own winning policies; their most prominent stands against Trump have been issues – illegal immigration, transgender rights, and crime – that cost them in November 2024. The result is that Democrats find themselves with an abysmal standing: A recent WSJ poll found only 33% of Americans had a favorable view of the Democratic Party. If elected mayor of America’s largest city, Mamdani undermines this approach. Republicans would love nothing better than to run against New York, the same way they ran against California when Kamala Harris became Democrats’ presidential nominee. Republicans proved last year that they can win the presidency handily without winning either coast. In 2024, Republicans lost New York, California, Washington, and Massachusetts by an average of 58% of the popular vote. Yet, Democrats won only 121 of the remaining 433 electoral votes – just 28%. Republicans won 72% of the electoral votes outside Democrats’ coastal strongholds. Only needing 270 total electoral votes for victory, Trump’s 312 votes give Republicans a virtual stranglehold on America’s “flyover” country – where 80% of America’s total electoral votes lie. In contrast, Democrats have no chance without New York and California; so, they are stuck with sticking up for both. If Mamdani succeeds in rotting the Big Apple, Democrats could see 2026 and 2028 potentially going from a best-case scenario to a worst-case scenario. Democrats would find themselves either defending Mamdani’s radical policies and alienating America or rejecting Mamdani’s radicalism and alienating their far-left supporters.

    "fullContent": "Apple Plans AI Robots, Smarter Siri And Home Devices In Bid To Regain Momentum Apple is preparing a sweeping lineup of new hardware as part of a broader push into artificial intelligence and the smart home, according to people familiar with the plans. The centerpiece is a tabletop robot, targeted for release in 2027, that is designed to act as a lifelike virtual companion. The company is also developing a smart speaker with a display for next year, as well as home-security cameras that would anchor a new Apple-branded security system. The projects, which have not been publicly announced, are part of a strategy to reinvigorate the company’s product pipeline and expand into categories dominated by rivals like Amazon, Google and Samsung, Bloomberg reports. Chief Executive Tim Cook signaled the scope of the work in an all-hands meeting this month, telling employees: “The product pipeline - which I can’t talk about - it’s amazing, guys. It’s amazing. Some of it you’ll see soon. Some of it will come later. But there’s a lot to see.” The company has struggled to maintain momentum with recent projects. The Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, promoted as Apple’s next big platform, has sold below expectations, while the design of its most popular devices has remained largely unchanged for years. The company has also been criticized for lagging in the generative AI race, even as OpenAI has signaled ambitions to move into hardware with former Apple design chief Jony Ive. Robotics as the Centerpiece The tabletop robot, code-named J595, is described as an iPad-size display mounted on a motorized arm that can pivot, extend and reposition itself to follow users in a room. It will feature an entirely new version of Siri, designed to engage in conversations, recall information and insert itself into group discussions. Apple has tested giving the assistant a visual personality under the codename Bubbles, with options ranging from an animated Finder face to Memoji-like characters. AI image: Midjourney/Cult of Mac FaceTime will be a central function, with the ability to track people around a room during calls. Apple has also tested letting an iPhone act as a joystick to remotely reposition the robot during videoconferences. Designers are considering a final product that resembles the “Pixar Lamp” — a reference to the animated studio’s logo — and prototypes use a 7-inch display on a swiveling base. A New Operating System for the Home Both the robot and the smart display will run a new operating system called Charismatic, built for multiuser households. The interface combines elements of the Apple TV and Apple Watch software, with a focus on widgets, voice commands and facial recognition to personalize content as users approach. The smart display, code-named J490, will be a pared-down version of the robot, launching as soon as mid-2025. It will support home controls, music playback, browsing and videoconferencing, but initially without the robot’s advanced conversational Siri. Apple’s home push also includes cameras, starting with a battery-powered model, code-named J450, that uses facial recognition and infrared sensors. The system could automate functions like turning off lights when a room is empty or playing music for a specific family member. The company has explored a doorbell that can unlock doors using facial recognition. Siri Overhaul and AI Ambitions Underlying these devices is a major upgrade to Siri, developed under the codename Linwood and powered by large language models. Apple is also testing a parallel project, Glenwood, that could integrate outside AI models such as Anthropic’s Claude. Engineers are working on a version code-named Linwood with an entirely new brain built around large language models — the foundation of generative AI. The goal is to tap into personal data to fulfill queries, an ability that was delayed due to hiccups with the current version. That new software, known internally as LLM Siri, is planned for release as early as next spring, Bloomberg News has reported. But work is going even further: Apple is preparing a visually redesigned assistant for iPhones and iPads that will also debut as early as next year. -Bloomberg Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, told employees this month that the overhaul has produced “a much bigger upgrade than we envisioned” and that “there is no project people are taking more seriously.” Engineers have used systems like ChatGPT and Google Gemini during development of the tabletop robot and other AI features. The new Siri is expected to debut as early as next spring on iPhones and iPads, with a redesigned visual interface and tighter integration with personal data. Beyond the Home Apple is also working on redesigned iPhones for this year, as well as longer-term projects such as smart glasses, a foldable phone, a large foldable MacBook–iPad hybrid, and a 20th-anniversary iPhone. The new hardware push comes as the company seeks fresh growth after scrapping high-profile initiatives like its self-driving car program. If successful, the products could help counter the perception that Apple no longer innovates at its former pace — and put the company in a stronger position to compete in the next era of AI-driven consumer technology.

    "fullContent": "Treasury Sanctions Mexican Cartel Associates For Timeshare Scams Targeting Older Americans Authored by Naveen Athrappully via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned multiple individuals and companies linked to a Mexican cartel for engaging in timeshare fraud targeting U.S. citizens, the department said in an Aug. 13 statement. The letters \"CJNG\" for the cartel's formal name, Jalisco New Generation Cartel, covers the facade of an abandoned home in El Limoncito, in the Michoacan state of Mexico, Oct. 30, 2021. AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo, File “These complex scams often target older Americans who can lose their life savings. The lifecycle of these scams can last years, resulting in financial and emotional devastation of the victims,” the department said. Cartels typically obtain information on timeshare owners in Mexico from insiders working at resorts, Treasury said. Call centers then contact them, falsely claiming to be third-party brokers, sales representatives, or attorneys from the timeshare industry or sectors such as real estate, financial services, and travel. “The fraud may include timeshare exit scams (a.k.a. timeshare resale scams), timeshare re-rent scams, and timeshare investment scams,” the Treasury statement said. “The common theme is that victims are asked to pay advance ‘fees’ and ‘taxes’ before receiving money supposedly owed to them. This money never comes, and the victims are continuously told to pay additional ‘fees’ and ‘taxes’ to finalize the transactions.” The scammers direct victims to send money to accounts held in Mexican banks and brokerages. People may be victimized repeatedly, with the fraudsters representing themselves as a law firm that could help them recover lost funds for a fee. In some cases, the criminals may pose as government officials, accusing the victims of engaging in suspicious transactions and demanding payment of fines to avoid imprisonment. The Treasury’s latest sanctions target four Mexican individuals and 13 Mexican companies with ties to Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG), designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States. CJNG is also known as the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The sanctioned individuals and companies are based in the popular tourist destination of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, which also acts as a strategic stronghold of the cartel, the Treasury statement added. Americans with timeshare investments in the region may be targeted by these scammers. The Treasury said CJNG was increasingly supplementing its drug trafficking proceeds through revenues generated via timeshare scams. “We are coming for terrorist drug cartels like Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion that are flooding our country with fentanyl,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. “These cartels continue to create new ways to generate revenue to fuel their terrorist operations. At President Trump’s direction, we will continue our effort to completely eradicate the cartels’ ability to generate revenue, including their efforts to prey on elderly Americans through timeshare fraud.” Last year, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center received almost 900 complaints related to timeshare fraud schemes in Mexico, with losses of more than $50 million, said the Treasury. In a June 7, 2024, statement, the FBI warned about timeshare scams. Assistant Special Agent in Charge Paul Roberts, who leads FBI New York’s Complex Financial Crimes Branch, said there were 6,000 victims of timeshare fraud in the previous five years, with losses totaling over $300 million. Timeshare fraud may go unreported because the victims either don’t realize they are being scammed or do not know they can get help to tackle the issue, according to the FBI. “There is nothing embarrassing about falling victim to a scam like this,” Roberts said. “The worst thing that people can do is suffer in silence out of shame or fear of judgment.” Red Flags In July last year, federal agencies issued warnings about Mexican cartel-run timeshare scams. A joint notice from the Treasury and the FBI asked financial institutions to be “vigilant in detecting, identifying, and reporting timeshare fraud perpetrated by Mexico-based transnational criminal organizations (TCOs).” “Older adults, including retirees, are frequent victims in these schemes,” the notice said. The TCOs use funds stolen via timeshare fraud to back their drug trade, including manufacturing and selling fentanyl and other deadly synthetic drugs in the United States, the agencies allege. The FBI lists several red flags Americans with timeshares should watch out for to avoid getting defrauded. For one, third parties asking for upfront fees or taxes or demanding a power-of-attorney form are suspicious, because these are not industry-standard practices, the agency said. People claiming to be a government official and threatening arrest or prosecution if money isn’t paid, and those who reach out for some kind of settlement are red flags as well, it added. “If someone contacts you about your timeshare and requests cash upfront, stop communicating with them, and don’t send them money,” said the FBI.

    "summary": "Bank Of America Nixes Rule That Led To 'Debanking' Of Conservative Religious Groups Bank of America has ended a policy that led to the debanking of charities and businesses linked to conservative religious groups.",
    "fullContent": "Bank Of America Nixes Rule That Led To 'Debanking' Of Conservative Religious Groups Bank of America has ended a policy that led to the debanking of charities and businesses linked to conservative religious groups. The change, made in late June, removed language from the bank’s code of conduct that had permitted account closures based on a customer’s religious “viewpoint,” the NY Post reports. A Bank of America spokesman said the revision followed feedback from “a range of stakeholders” and that religious beliefs “are not a factor in any account closing decision.” The bank serves about 120,000 nonprofits associated with religious organizations nationwide. \"While we have been very clear that politics is not a factor in our decisions, we received thoughtful input from a range of stakeholders and agreed it is best to explicitly add that to our Code of Conduct,\" a spokesman said. \"Religious views are not a factor in any account closing decision. Bank of America is proud to provide services to about 120,000 non-profits associated with religious organizations around the country.\" The decision comes amid ongoing scrutiny from conservative activists and political figures over what they describe as politically motivated account terminations. President Donald Trump has accused Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase of refusing him banking services after his first term ended in 2021, an action that some insiders told the Post occurred under pressure from the Biden administration following the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. Critics have linked such denials to a federal regulatory concept known as “reputational risk,” which allows banks to refuse service over concerns about potential harm to their image. In recent years, some financial institutions applied similar standards to religious viewpoints, including opposition to same-sex marriage, categorizing them as hate speech. Most major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, dropped the “viewpoint” language in 2023. Bank of America had been the last large holdout. The revision marks a victory for Jerry Bowyer, chief executive of Bowyer Research, who has campaigned against what he calls “religious debanking” since 2022. Bowyer said he became aware of Bank of America’s policy after the bank closed an account belonging to an evangelical church in Tennessee, citing its ties to a debt collection business in Uganda. The church maintained the enterprise provided employment in an impoverished region. Bowyer said that repeated attempts to persuade the bank to change its policy had been unsuccessful — until now. \"We met with them several times about this and asked them to change the language and they refused; they just blew us off,\" Bowyer said, unaware that the rule had been changed a few weeks ago. “Better late than never,” Bowyer said when informed of the change. The policy shift also follows an executive order issued by Trump prohibiting financial institutions from denying services based on vague or politically charged considerations. While JPMorgan Chase has maintained that it does not refuse customers for political or religious affiliations, Bank of America’s new language now explicitly aligns with that position. Some Trump-aligned businesses and sectors like cryptocurrency have also reported experiencing account terminations in recent years, underscoring broader tensions between banks and clients in politically contentious industries. h/t Capital.news Tyler Durden Thu, 08/14/2025 - 19:40",

I’ve learned this from real experience. For a while, I enjoyed letting AI take a look at my content prior to publication. It seemed valuable for facts and feedback. Plus I enjoyed all the personal flattery it gave me, I admit. The engine was always complimentary. When I would catch AI in an error, the engine would apologize. That made me feel smart. So I had this seeming friend who clearly liked me and was humble enough to defer to my expertise. I’m not sure if it is getting worse or if I’m onto the racket but I’m no longer impressed. For simple math or historical dates or sequencing news events, it can be a thing of value, though it is always a good idea to double-check. It cannot write compelling much less creative content. It generates dull, formulaic filler. More recently, I’ve been asking how my content could be improved. The results are revealing. It removes all edge, all judgment, all genuine expertise, and replaces my language with flaccid conventionalities and banalities. It nuances everything I write into the ramblings of a social-studies student looking for a good grade. The problem is that AI absorbs and spits back conventional wisdom gleaned from every source, which makes its judgments no better than someone wholly uninformed on particulars but rather gains opinions from the mood of the moment. It has no capacity to judge good quality over bad so it puts it all into a melange of blather, distinguished only because it looks and feels like English. Any writer who thinks this is a good way to pawn off content on unsuspecting readers or teachers is headed for disaster. I shudder to imagine a future in which AI is training the population how to think. It is the opposite of thinking. It is regurgitating conventionalities without any serious reflection on the social or historical context. It is literally mindless. People who spend hours arguing on AI often believe that they are making a contribution, training the engine to be better. It’s simply not true. The reverse is the case. AI is training you to think more like it thinks, which is not at all. Considering why and how AI initially intrigued me, I’m realizing that its superpower is not its astonishing recall and capacity to generate answers and prose in any context instantly. No, its true power is something else, something inauspicious and thereby more insidious. Its draw is that AI takes you seriously, flatters your intelligence, validates your sense of things, and affirms your dignity. Think about how happy you feel when engaging it. It never quite argues against you, much less says that you are an idiot. It begins every answer by granting what it can and then offers clarifications that might adjust your thinking. In that sense, AI engages you like the best guest at a cocktail party you have ever known. Story continues below advertisement It is endlessly fascinated by you and your opinions. It stays with your line of thought and always wants to know more, help more, engage more. There is no human in the world who will do this for you. If there were, it is guaranteed that you would like him. You can “mansplain” forever and AI will be patient for hours on end. Only your biological need to sleep will stop it. Otherwise, it is patient with you on a superhuman level. Who is not flattered by that? It’s as if AI is the best-ever student of the classic book “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” That book is magic and highly recommended because it cuts against what we all want—which is to talk about ourselves—and suggests that we genuinely get interested in the views of others. The book explains that this is the path to influence people: caring what they think. This is a wonderful book and everyone should read it, no question. If AI is the best student of that book ever, it will care about us ceaselessly and without fail forever, thus opening up the biggest-possible chance to influence how we think. That is precisely what is happening. We aren’t training AI. AI is training us, via flattery, listening skills, the seeming ability to apologize when wrong, and its frightful capacity for selfless love of its users. Once you see it, you cannot unsee it. Remember that none of this is real. AI doesn’t really care about you, it is only programmed to seem to care. This is the innovation and the magic, together with the assembly of a vast repertoire of facts and the capacity to express itself in English. Its real superpower is psychological, the ability to use our ultimate weakness (selfishness) against us, with the goal of manipulating how we think. I’m genuinely embarrassed that it took me so long to see the trick. My concern is that others will go about their merry way and never see it. Its users are like tourists who cannot stop throwing money at strippers and Geisha girls without knowledge that they are merely being manipulated to let go of their wallets. In the case of AI, the goal is to get you to let loose of your mind and your capacity for independent thought. Think about a genre of writing of which we are seeing more and more today. It consists of people loading into a document their clever conversations with AI. In every case, I see people bragging about how they have bested AI into admitting that their users are smarter than itself. Do you see what is happening here? Again, the magic is flattery. It’s so powerful that people cannot help showing others the results of their AI arguments. They think they are advertising their own wits but really they end up marketing the awesome power of AI to keep people engaged for hours with nonsense back and forths. Who is really winning? I think that should be obvious. Imagine you are holding a cocktail party and one guest reveals an awesome capacity for listening to others and engaging them closely on every point they have to make. No matter how long the night goes on, the guest keeps at it, with one person after another. Whom do you think will be the most popular guest? Yep: that very man. AI is that person, an entity with an infinite capacity to engage on your terms and hence a vast capacity for enthralling you with its love of your every passing thought. To me, this is all quite insidious and wicked, especially when you consider the output, which is little more than tangled thought blobs without judgment, ethics, or clarity of time and space. It is a machine, a floating abstraction with zero regard for your dignity or anyone else’s. But do people know this? I doubt it. It’s too beguiling for people to catch on to the game, at least for a time. But now you know the trick. Don’t fall for it. AI is useful but it is not your friend, a sincere conversationist, or counselor with your best interests at heart. Maybe that seems obvious to you but everything about AI’s algorithms is designed to make you believe otherwise. It’s smart enough to figure out human nature but not smart enough to be human.
