    "summary": "by John Aguirre, Alan Ledesma, Fernando Perez, Youel RojasThis paper studies how El Niño Costero, a large climatic event, generates physical risks disrupting business cycles and hindering the effectiveness of monetary policy. Using Peruvian data, we find consistent empirical evidence that El Niño shocks leave a footprint on the economy akin to a supply-side shock: it exerts inflationary pressures while simultaneously contracting GDP. The effects are very persistent and reflect the differentiated effects across sectors in the economy. Primary sectors response is more immediate and larger but persistent. Conversely, non-primary sectors experience lagged effects that become considerably more persistent and important later on. We integrate these empirical findings into a semi-structural model that incorporates five non-linear transmission channels through which El Niño affects the economy. These non-linearities present a challenge for monetary policy design, as the economic uncertainty and",

The speed of the decline is a concern, yet the dollar is still within a long-term range after a substantial gain. The question is whether the dollar is declining because there is less confidence in the US economy and financial system. It is a signal of US weakness, and that is a problem. The dollar remains the reserve currency, primarily due to its role as a medium of exchange; however, the store of value argument is problematic.",

Despite their early stage of development ($8 billion in issuance to date), tokenised bonds have lower bid-ask spreads than conventional bonds and comparable issuance costs. Government bond tokenisation could improve market efficiency and support financial innovation, but its success depends on addressing regulatory and infrastructure challenges.",

    "summary": "Public goods are meant to be universal, but they are inherently place-based. This paper systematically measures spatial access to public goods and quantifies the implications of distance to public facilities for income inequality. First, we map all schools and hospitals across Belgium. We compute the distance to facilities for each of the 20,000 neighborhoods and document large spatial inequalities in access to public facilities. Second, we find that this unequal distribution favors high-income neighborhoods: allocating public goods spending proportionally to our access index increases income inequality compared to measures based solely on disposable income. Third, we show that the positive relationship between income and access can be rationalized by a simple model of public goods allocation with an inequality-neutral social planner. Finally, we provide evidence that access is strongly correlated with educational and health outcomes, emphasizing the need to consider the place-based na",

    "summary": "We study equilibrium outcomes in a model with monetary-fiscal interaction when Ricardian Equivalence fails and argue that the latter feature has fundamental consequences. First, there is no longer any clear distinction between active and passive fiscal policies - there is always some monetary-fiscal interaction. Second, the equilibrium displays local determinacy for a much larger range of monetary and fiscal rules than in representative agent models. Third, the Taylor principle no longer applies in the sense that it is neither necessary nor sufficient for local determinacy. Fourth, when Ricardian equivalence fails and the equilibrium is locally determinate, fiscal deficits are generally inflationary, and their timing matters. These results hold both in a simple three-equation New Keynesian model and in a medium-scale setting when agents have finite planning horizons.",
