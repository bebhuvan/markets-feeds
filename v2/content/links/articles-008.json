    "fullContent": "Golden Visa: Where You Can Buy Residence Permits After its unveiling in April and a highly popular waitlist launch in June, the Trump administration’s proposed golden visa program seems to be stalling. Named “the Gold Card” and later “the Trump Card”, it promises U.S. residency to wealthy individuals for a $5 million investment in the country. While Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced the card would be made from real precious metal, all that glitters is not gold for the project that reportedly lacks legal grounding and faces an uncertain future. President Donald Trump said in April on board the Air Force One that a launch was less than two weeks away. However, by the beginning of August, no news on the topic has been shared and no law has been introduced in Congress despite almost 70,000 waitlist entries reportedly having been creating in less than a week after the launch of Trumpcard.gov on June 11. Experts interviewed on the topic by CNBC have raised legal concerns surrounding the program. While Trump said he wanted to replace the current EB-5 program, which ties residency to the creation of an approximately $1 million new business, this would require unlikely Congressional approval. Another major issue is the U.S. tax code that taxes global income, which is not attractive for immigrant investors. Trump said he wants this changed, which again would be a major hurdle. At the same time, interest in the U.S. golden visa is still very high as several similar programs in Europe have recently shut down in Spain, Ireland and the Netherlands while more were tightened amid government changes and criticism of the concept. The U.S. proposal has also supposedly received increased interest in light of Trump’s threat to abolish birthright citizenship - yet another proposal marred in legal issues. On July 24, a federal appeals court handed Trump a defeat in the matter, saying that the executive order on the topic was unconstitutional. As Statista's Katharina Buchholz shows in the chart below, data by law firm Henley & Partners shows which golden visa or comparable schemes continue to exist for wealthy people around the world. You will find more infographics at Statista Some of the most prolific include remaining ones inside the European Union, giving access to a Schengen visa. Countries currently offering golden visas in the EU include Italy, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Malta. The United Arab Emirates have also become a popular destination for wealthy immigrants and offer a similar program. As the data shows, countries in the English-speaking world, including the U.S. itself, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, have so far only offered more restrictive options, giving residency to certain high-profile business founders who want to start operations in critical sectors or can create a certain number of jobs. While types of investor visas differ, so do investment sums and how they are paid. Buying real estate is one popular option, but most golden visa countries offer several different options to secure a residence permit, including starting or investing in a business, investing in stocks or bonds locally or making a direct contribution to the government. In the EU, investment sums typically range between $250,000 and $500,000, with Latvia the outlier at just $60,000. Non-EU nations Serbia and Montenegro have been trying to get in on the southern European golden visa boom and are offering residency for any real estate purchase or if an applicant wants to start a business in the country and shell out the annual cost associated with it. Beyond Europe, investment sums can be lower starting at $50,000 in Mauritius, $100,000 in Panama and $150,000 in Costa Rica. Nations including Italy, Austria, Costa Rica, Monaco and Uruguay also allow financially independent people to live within their countries. Finally, some places including Switzerland and Thailand want immigrant investors to benefit them more directly. The Swiss visa is tied to a minimum $250,000 annual tax contribution, while Thailand charges directly for its so-called Privilege Residence Program, starting at $25,000 for five years. While the cost is low in comparison, the program is not directly tied to a permanent, but rather a temporary residency. Tyler Durden Sun, 08/17/2025 - 07:35",

    "fullContent": "Two Tier UK: 'Cut Throats' Councilor Freed, While Mother Who Tweeted Still In Prison Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, A leftist councillor in the UK who called for “cutting the throats” of anti-mass migration protesters has been acquitted of all charges and set free, while conservatives who expressed anti-illegal immigration sentiment in tweets are still languishing in prison. Here’s the backstory: “They are disgusting Nazi fascists,” asserted Labour councillor named Ricky Jones a year ago, adding “And we need to cut all their throats and get rid of them all,” while performing the cut throat gesture by running his finger across his neck. “We’ve got to cut their throats & get rid of all of them” said Ricky Jones Councillor in Walthamstow ‘Not guilty’ But post a furious X post or shout at police dog or ‘other’ words of different opinions & prison time Two Tier justice needs to be stopped Insist Together pic.twitter.com/19dUKpIZSh — Alan D Miller (@alanvibe) August 15, 2025 The incident came amid unrest prompted by the horrific murder of three children in Southport by Axel Rudakubana, a 17-year-old born in the UK to Rwandan migrant parents. Jones, a 57-year-old borough councillor in Dartford, Kent, and a full-time official for the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) union, made the inflammatory remarks at a counter-demonstration in Walthamstow, north London. He was arrested the following day on suspicion of encouraging violent disorder. He was suspended by the Labour Party immediately after the video surfaced. During his trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court, the prosecution argued that his words were “inflammatory and rabble-rousing,” amplified in a volatile setting where police anticipated potential clashes. A senior police officer testified that “any spark could have led to an incident or disorder occurring.” In his defense, Jones claimed his comments were not directed at the contemporary far-right protesters but referenced historical acts by the National Front, a far-right group from the 1970s and 1980s, who allegedly left razor blades behind stickers on trains to harm unsuspecting people. He stated “You’ve got women and children using these trains during the summer holidays. They don’t give a s*** about who they hurt.” It’s an absolutely bizarre argument by Jones to claim he was calling for cutting the throats of people 40-50 years ago, but it has worked because he’s walked free. Jones also cited neurodiversity, saying he has been diagnosed with ADHD, dyslexia, and dyscalculia, and stating it caused him to become distracted by a heckler in the crowd, leading to unprepared and misinterpreted remarks. He reiterated a commitment to peaceful protest, saying, “I’ve always believed the best way to make people realise who you are and what you are is to do it peacefully.” After a brief deliberation of just over 30 minutes, the jury cleared Jones of all charges, accepting his explanation and finding no intent to encourage violence. Outside the court, Jones expressed relief, calling the ordeal “the worst thing that ever happened to me” and vowing never to speak unprepared at a demonstration again. The verdict drew sharp criticism from political figures, including former Tory home secretary James Cleverly, who called it “two-tier justice,” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who labeled it “absolutely disgraceful,” and Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf, who highlighted the disparity in legal outcomes. This case has intensified debates about inconsistencies in how the UK justice system handles inflammatory speech, particularly when compared to the treatment of Lucy Connolly, a 41-year-old childminder and wife of a former Conservative councillor. On the day of the Southport stabbings, Connolly posted on X (formerly Twitter): “Mass deportation now, set fire to all the f***ing hotels full of the bastards for all I care… If that makes me racist, so be it.” Her tweet, fueled by the same false rumors about the attacker’s identity, was deemed to incite racial hatred. Connolly pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 31 months in prison in October 2024. She later lost an appeal against the sentence in May 2025, with judges upholding the term despite arguments that it was excessive and raised free speech concerns. Connolly’s case sparked a broader row over freedom of expression, with supporters launching a fundraiser that raised over $100,000 for her family. Critics argue her punishment reflects a heavy-handed approach to online rhetoric, especially when juxtaposed with Jones’s acquittal. While Jones’s words explicitly called for violent acts like “cutting throats” in a public setting, he walked free after a jury trial. Connolly, however, faced swift conviction for a single social media post that did not directly advocate physical harm in the same graphic manner. With anti-mass migration protests once again happening all over the country, serious questions persist about whether the legal system applies consistent standards or if ideological leanings influence outcomes. For now, Jones resumes his life without charges, while Connolly serves her sentence, highlighting a divide that continues to provoke public outrage. * * * Your support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.
