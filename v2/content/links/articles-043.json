(Shutterstock) According to Banxico, Mexico's national bank, remittances from the United States have fallen by nearly 6% since January, and 16.2% during the month of June - when only $5.2 billion was sent back to Mexico, vs $6.207 billion in the same month in 2024. And while the bank reports that the average amount being sent back is higher than in 2024 at $409, the number of people sending money back has dropped by 14%. Executives at Western Union recently admitted on an earnings call that the outflow of hot money from the United States has slowed amid the crackdown on illegal aliens. CFO Matt Cagwin told Wall Street analysts that they \"continued to see weakness in North America, driven by immigration policy, which led to a slowdown in the independent channel.\" CEO Devin McGranahan explained that the \"slowdown\" is in both retail and digital businesses between the United States and Mexico. Over the past year, nearly $63 billion was sent back to Mexico by people living north of the border - a significant drop from the peak years of 2023 and 2024. Illegals sent $56 billion dollars back to their home countries just in the year 2024 $56 BILLION was sent out of America while they received free housing, healthcare, food etc This has been the scam of illegals for decades. Collect our benefits while building a life in Mexico pic.twitter.com/DWGgd84ROW — Wall Street Apes (@WallStreetApes) June 23, 2025 \"Remittances plummeted in June due to low job creation for Mexicans in the United States and the fear of migrants to go out due to the possibility of being deported,\" Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis at Banco Base, wrote on X on Friday, adding that \"remittances could continue to decline for the rest of the year, affecting consumption in Mexico.\" As we noted on Friday, there has been an unprecedented purge of illegal alien workers in the United States. In July, the number of foreign born workers tumbled by 467K. It wasn't just July though: as shown below, foreign-born workers (which, again, are mostly illegal aliens) have declined four months in a row... Analysts, meanwhile, think remittances could continue to fall throughout the second half of the year. Analysts from the banks Banorte, BBVA, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan also believe there is a risk that remittances will continue to decline in the second half of 2025, according to the newspaper El Economista. Such an eventuality would affect millions of Mexican families that depend on remittances to meet their basic needs. It would also affect the Mexican economy, reducing consumption and thus contributing to what is widely forecast to be a lower level of growth in 2025. -MexicoNewsDaily The vast majority of remittances to Mexico are sent from the United States - which will impose a 1% tax on cash sent starting Jan. 1, 2026 - which has prompted the Mexican government to promote a government bank card that can avoid US-based Mexicans to avoid the tax. Immigrants are leaving US workforce in mass. Remittance payments US→MX plummeting, down over -2 million from a year ago. Biggest decline by far in 30+ years - a period that includes a homebuilding depression and a 100-year financial crisis. pic.twitter.com/o49TeyLvOC — Eric Finnigan (@EricFinnigan) August 3, 2025 99% of money transfers were done electronically, while the rest were done via cash or money transfers according to Banxico, as reported by Border Report. According to Jesús Cervantes González, director of economic statistics at the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, \"there are indicators that show a weakening of employment for Mexican immigrant workers in the United States,\" MexicoNewsDaily reports. \"That could be due both to a genuine decrease in demand for such workers and to their irregular presence at their workplaces out of fear of being deported,\" he said. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been carrying out immigration raids in various US cities this year - including a major operation in Los Angeles in June - with President Trump pledging to carry out the \"largest deportation operation in US history.\" Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 06:55",

That’s even as the latest economic data suggests the US economy is grappling with the fallout. “We’ll be putting a initially small tariff on pharmaceuticals, but in one year — one and a half years, maximum — it’s going to go to 150% and then it’s going to go to 250% because we want pharmaceuticals made in our country,” Trump said Tuesday in the interview on CNBC.

    "fullContent": "Rail Merger Will Bring \"Dismal Service\" & \"High Rates\" Says Shippers Group By Stuart Chirls of FreightWaves, A trade group representing 3,500 chemical, manufacturing, agriculture, and energy companies warned that past history shows that a proposed merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern will push up shipping costs without improving service. “The Freight Rail Customer Alliance (FRCA) has long been opposed to continued consolidation in the rail industry based on past experiences resulting in increased rates, higher fees and unreliable service,” said FRCA President Emily Regis, in a release. UP and NS on July 29 announced the $85 billion stock-and-cash deal to create a transcontinental system with more than 50,000 route-miles of track in 43 states. The carriers said the acquisition would improve service by cutting up to 48 hours from a loaded railcar’s total travel time from departure to arrival, know as dwell, while simplifying paperwork and creating a seamless journey for trains moving from coast to coast. The FRCA pointed out that since the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 deregulated freight railroads, the industry has shrunk from 40 Class I carriers to six, with four handling 90% of U.S. rail freight. “This demonstrated market power is a continuing concern as the railroads have lost market share to trucks over the past 20-plus years due to their dismal service and high rates, but the railroads keep increasing their profits and reducing their operating ratios,” said FRCA spokesperson Ann Warner, in the release. “This growth in and exploitation of railroad market power has also included forcing shippers into contracts that not only fall outside the Surface Transportation Board’s (STB) regulatory jurisdiction but also lack protection from poor service and increased fees. Any efficiencies achieved under so-called Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) have NOT been passed through to shippers – only retained by the railroads and their shareholders to Wall Street’s applause.” The adjudicatory authority of the STB, which will either accept or reject the UP-NS deal, covers published tariff rates and not confidential contracts between railroads and shippers. As far as service is concerned, unlike shippers who move goods by the carload, the FRCA observed that it is unclear how the STB’s tougher merger rules would benefit its larger shippers who move bulk freight such as coal or grain in trains dedicated to a single commodity, known as unit trains. Regis stated that “particularly important to FRCA members is that a transcontinental merger provides enhanced competition for those who ship via unit train, typically point-to-point, and can utilize only a single rail carrier.” About half of the 1.5 billion tons of freight shipped annually on U.S. rail are bulk commodities. “In the end, shippers, particularly captive shippers, need guaranteed competitive solutions that are workable, effective, and enforced by the STB. Even if this imperative can be achieved in a transcontinental merger, there are concerns about how long it would take for the improvements to be successfully implemented and whether the integration problems and service meltdowns of past mergers can be avoided,” Regis said. Werner said that the “FRCA looks forward to participating in the review and comment period once a formal merger application(s) has been filed.” Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 06:30",
