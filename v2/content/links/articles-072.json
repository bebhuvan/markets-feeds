    "fullContent": "Jailed American Hit With New Charges By Russian Court, As 9 Total US Citizens Remain Imprisoned Russian prosecutors have brought new charges against Robert Gilman, an American citizen and former Marine who was already slapped with an eight-year prison sentence for attacking law enforcement while drunk as well as a prison official, according to court records. The 30-year old Gilman has actually owned up to the attacks - but claimed self-defense and that he was also responding to insults. The new charges, which were filed in late July in a court in Voronezh, southern Russia, are also said to relate to alleged assaults on prison staff. Ex-Marine Robert Gilman, Sputnik via AP Kommersant newspaper says Gilman’s legal team is requestiong a reduced sentence, citing an unspecified mental health issue, and he's next due in court on August 25. Gilman's family as well as advocacy groups say he was wrongfully detained on false charges, and further that he's being held as a bargaining chip for future possible prisoner swap with Washington. Here's how one such US non-profit organization working on obtaining his freedom characterizes his arrest: Robert is a Marine Corps veteran, who was traveling in Russia when he fell sick on a train. Instead of medical help, he was taken to a police station. He fell into a cycle of charges, which began with a case that was dismissed, a second that was without evidence, and a third for assault of a police officer where even the police officer says he should not be charged. A typical Russian Government tactic is getting Americans into their system, and pile on various unfounded charges to keep them there. This is Robert’s story, and they continue to put him in conditions that set him up for further charges that further politicize his case. Beyond this, the profile of the case against Robert appears eerily familiar to the Trevor Reed case, where a former Marine unexpectedly blacked out and was charged with punching a police officer, suggesting this may all have been staged. And here is a description of what came next via the Amsterdam-based Moscow Times: Robert Gilman, 30, was found guilty of attacking a policeman while drunk in the western city of Voronezh in 2022 and sentenced to four and a half years in jail, which was later reduced to three and a half years following an appeal. While jailed for that conviction, Gilman allegedly punched prison staff \"in the head\" on two separate occasions, once during an inspection of his cell in September 2023 and again in October, according to prosecutors cited by the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Days later he attacked a criminal investigator and, after being moved to a pre-trial detention center, struck another prison guard during a search, the agency reported. In October 2024, when Gilman was sentence for the attack on a prison guard, Reuters featured the following: \"RIA cited Gilman as telling the court last week that he had been forced to use violence after the prison inspector had caused pain to his genitalia and after the investigator had insulted his father.\" Such an admission and the circumstances surrounding his case are perhaps why so far the US government has not declared him 'wrongfully detained' - which is a legal designation which signfifies the US sees someone as essentially a hostage for which a swap can be authorized. Even after a series of past high-profile prisoner swaps - from Brittney Griner to former US Marine Paul Whelan to The Wall Street Journal's Evan Gershkovich and others - at least nine American citizens are currently imprisoned in Russia. Gordon Black, David Barnes, Robert Gilman, Ksenia Karelina, Stephen Hubbard, Joseph Tater, Gene Spector, Robert Woodland. AP/TASS via Moscow Times Back in April, Russian-American ballerina and spa worker Ksenia Karelina was swaped for a Russian national accused by the US government of helping transfer sensitive electronics to the Russian military. Karelina had been hit with treason charges by the Russian government, for merely making a $51.80 donation to an American charity supporting victims of the war in Ukraine. Apparently the transaction had been found on her phone while she visited Russian family, and this was enough to get her an ultra-harsh 12 year sentence in a Russian labor camp. Thus her case was more easily classified as 'wrongfully detained' by the US. Below is a summary review of the other eight detained Americans still in Russia, compiled by Reuters & other media sources: Stephen James Hubbard Hubbard, 73, was sentenced to six years and 10 months in prison in October last year after being convicted in a closed court in Moscow of serving as a mercenary for Ukraine. Russian state media said he pleaded guilty. An English teacher who had previously lived in Japan and Cyprus, Hubbard had been living in the Ukrainian town of Izium and was arrested after Russian forces took control of the town in 2022. His relatives rejected claims that Hubbard served for Ukraine, pointing to his advanced age. He was designated by the US in January as “wrongfully detained”, meaning Washington is committed to try to negotiate his release. Gordon Black An active duty US staff sergeant based in South Korea, Black was detained in May 2024 in Russia's Far East on suspicion of stealing money from his Russian girlfriend. A court in June found Black guilty of stealing 10,000 roubles (R1,874) from the woman and threatening to kill her, sentencing him to three years and nine months in prison. In April, a Russian court cut Black's sentence to three years and two months. Daniel Joseph Schneider Schneider was sentenced to six years in prison in September last year by a court in the Kaliningrad region for kidnapping his son after he tried to leave Russia with the four-year-old without permission from the boy's mother. Schneider was detained near Poland by Russia's border service while trying to cross the border in a forest swamp, the court said. Joseph Tater Tater was sentenced to 15 days in jail last August for “petty hooliganism” after he was alleged to have abused staff at a Moscow hotel, which he denied. Russian news agencies later said he was also being investigated on a more serious charge of assaulting a police officer, which carries up to five years in prison. On April 6 a court ordered Tater be removed from pretrial detention and placed in hospital. State media said doctors have diagnosed him with a mental disorder. A Russian court later ruled he was not criminally responsible for his actions and committed him for treatment in a Russian hospital. Michael Travis Leake A musician and former US paratrooper, Leake was sentenced to 13 years in prison last July for drug smuggling. It was not clear how Leake pleaded to the charges, filed after his arrest in June 2023. Robert Romanov Woodland A US citizen adopted from Russia as a child, Woodland had moved back to Russia and was working as an English teacher when he was arrested on charges of attempting to sell drugs. He was sentenced on July 4 last year to 12 years and six month in prison. His lawyer said Woodland had partially admitted guilt. In April, a Russian court ordered Woodland's jail sentence be reduced to nine years and six months, his lawyer told Reuters. Eugene Spector Serving a three year and six months sentence for bribery, Spector, who was born in Russia and moved to the US, was charged last August with espionage. Before his arrest in 2021, he served as chair of the board of Medpolymerprom Group, a company specialising in cancer-curing drugs, state media said. Spector had pleaded guilty to helping bribe an assistant to an ex-Russian deputy prime minister. It was not clear how he pleaded to the espionage charge. David Barnes Barnes was sentenced by a Russian court in February 2024 to 21 years on charges of abusing his two sons in the US. He had been involved in a custody dispute with his Russian ex-wife. The allegations had previously been investigated in Texas, where authorities found no grounds to charge him. Andre Khachatoorian An Armenian-American from Los Angeles, Khachatoorian was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison in 2023 for arms trafficking. He was arrested in 2021, while travelling from California to Armenia via Moscow, after a firearm was found in his luggage. Khachatoorian, 38, said his firearm was legal, and he was tricked into applying for a Russian visa at the airport, and removed from the transit zone, where he could be arrested under Russian law. * * * It is entirely possible that at least some of these imprisoned individuals could be traded in a future swap with the United States - something which Moscow has clearly shown itself open to, especially in instances where it can get back from US custody people that may have been tied with its intelligence services.

    "fullContent": "Syria Eyes Pipeline Lifeline As Post-Assad Power Struggle Escalates By Charles Kennedy of OilPrice.com Syria’s caretaker government is moving to restore the Kirkuk-Baniyas oil pipeline with Iraq, a strategic corridor that had the capacity to move up to 300,000 barrels per day to Syria’s Mediterranean coast before war and sanctions shut it down in the early 2000s. Syrian Energy Minister Mohammed al-Bashir will travel to Baghdad in the coming days to discuss rehabilitation plans, according to Iraqinews.com. For Damascus, reconnecting to Iraq’s oil network could provide critical transit revenues, reduce reliance on costly maritime imports, and restore its position as a regional energy hub. For Baghdad, reopening the route would offer an alternative export outlet to Europe, bypassing chokepoints in the Strait of Hormuz and diversifying away from Turkey-dependent pipelines, as highlighted by Shafaq News. The proposal comes as post-Assad Syria navigates a shifting geopolitical landscape. Regional powers, including Turkey, Iran, and Gulf states, are recalibrating their strategies, while Western capitals weigh how to engage without ceding influence to rivals. Analysts told the Yetkin Report that the Kirkuk-Baniyas revival could weaken Ankara’s leverage over Iraqi exports and reshape Mediterranean energy flows. The revival of the Kirkuk-Baniyas could also have far-reaching consequences for Baghdad’s relations with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq. For over two years, northern exports have been hampered by the shutdown of the Iraq-Turkey pipeline to Ceyhan, a route that runs through territory controlled by the KRG. A functioning Baniyas route would give Baghdad a northern export corridor that bypasses both KRG-controlled infrastructure and Turkish territory. Analysts note that this could diminish Erbil’s bargaining power in budget talks and shift Iraq’s export calculus toward Syrian cooperation. The change could also heighten tensions if Baghdad attempts to channel crude from disputed fields in Kirkuk and Nineveh through Syria without KRG consent. Tyler Durden Tue, 08/12/2025 - 18:25",

    "fullContent": "Appeals Court Rules DOGE Can Access Sensitive Federal Data Authored by Sam Dorman via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), An appeals court has removed a block imposed on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessing data within various federal departments. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) website is displayed on a phone, in this photo illustration. Oleksii Pydsosonnii/The Epoch Times In a 2-1 decision on Aug. 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said the judge who issued the block erred in weighing how likely it was that the plaintiffs would succeed in their ongoing lawsuit against the Trump administration. The decision marked a win for the administration, which has encountered a wave of lawsuits related to DOGE’s activities within the federal government. The agency was set up in February under the temporary direction of tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, whom Trump designated as a special government employee, to identify wasteful spending and inefficiencies within the federal government. Fourth Circuit Judge Julius Richardson said that in this particular lawsuit, the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed in proving they had standing or that DOGE’s activities violated federal law. He compared DOGE to a consultant tasked with improving the efficiency of a local library. “Barring the consultant at the library doors and requiring her to specify the precise records she needs to improve the library before she knows what improvements are needed would seem to get the order of operations precisely backward,” he said. DOGE, also known as the U.S. DOGE Service, was set up by President Donald Trump to modernize “federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.” It includes an overarching agency along with DOGE-affiliated employees working within departments like the Treasury Department. In February, a group of individuals and unions sued the administration, alleging that DOGE was “steamrolling into sensitive government record systems” and compromising the safety and security of Americans’ personal information. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman eventually issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Department of Education, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Treasury Department from disclosing the plaintiffs’ information to any DOGE affiliates, whom she described as individuals tasked with implementing Trump’s executive order. According to Richardson’s opinion, Boardman’s order effectively paused DOGE activities within the three federal entities, although the appeals court had quickly intervened with a temporary block on that order. Months later, the Supreme Court weighed in on a similar case and lifted a lower court order blocking DOGE from accessing confidential data at the Social Security Administration. Richardson said that case and the one before him were “exceedingly similar.” Plaintiffs in both cases alleged violations of the Privacy Act, a federal law that restricts how government agencies can share personal information. One of the exceptions in the law allows disclosure to agency employees who have a need for the particular record in the performance of their duties. Boardman had said that the administration likely violated this law, stating that the record before her hadn’t shown why their access was necessary. “Here, the need-to-know exception has been invoked to defend the disclosure of millions of records,” she said, describing DOGE’s access to the Education Department as “seemingly unfettered.” Richardson disagreed on Aug. 12. “To insist that the DOGE affiliates explain in advance the exact information they need and why is to demand something just short of clairvoyance,” he said. “So it does not stretch the imagination to think that an employee tasked with modernizing an agency’s software and IT systems would require administrator-level access to those systems, including any internal databases, especially when conducting the initial survey of the agency’s technological ailments.” He saw several other flaws with the plaintiffs’ case, including that they likely didn’t have standing to sue the administration. Judge Robert King dissented from the appeals court’s decision and defended Boardman’s order, stating that she “did exactly what [she] was obliged to do.” The Supreme Court was relatively brief in its decision on June 6 that lifted a block on DOGE’s access to the Social Security Administration. However, three liberal justices said they would have denied the administration’s request for relief in that case. A dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson echoed Boardman’s claim about DOGE’s reach. Matthew Vadum contributed to this report. Tyler Durden Tue, 08/12/2025 - 17:40",

    "fullContent": "Macrons Secretly Hired Investigator To Dig Up Dirt On Candace Owens French President Emmanuel Macron and First Lady Brigitte Macron have been revealed to have hired a private investigation firm to research conservative commentator Candace Owens, according to a new report from the Financial Times. The investigation comes as the French presidential couple pursues a defamation lawsuit against Owens over repeated allegations across multiple platforms that Brigitte Macron was born male. The cross-continental probe was conducted by New York-based firm Nardell & Co, which, according to the British business news outlet, attempted to uncover damaging information about Owens by scrutinizing her public statements and political connections. Investigators reportedly looked into whether the popular podcaster had any direct ties to Russian officials or business interests. While the investigation failed to establish any direct Russian connections, researchers did document Owens' online interactions with Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin. The report noted that both figures have shared each other's content on social media platforms various times. The 218-page lawsuit, filed in Delaware Superior Court last week, includes 22 separate counts against Owens, including defamation, false light invasion of privacy, and defamation by implication. The legal action centers on Owens' repeated allegations across multiple platforms that Brigitte Macron was born male. Researchers also documented her connections to other prominent conservative figures, including conservative journalist Tucker Carlson and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. \"When it comes to Brigitte Macron, abusing Emmanuel and then blaming it on Russia is an unfortunate and sinister pattern,\" Owens responded to the Financial Times report. The Macrons' attorney Tom Clare has characterized the case as straightforward defamation, stating that Owens \"both promoted and expanded on\" what he called \"discredited falsehoods originally presented by a self-proclaimed spiritual medium and so-called investigative journalist.\" According to court documents, Owens has promoted these claims through social media posts and an eight-part YouTube series titled \"Becoming Brigitte,\" which the Macrons' legal team argues has led to significant online harassment of the first lady. Court filings indicate the Macrons' representatives made multiple requests for retractions before filing the lawsuit. The presidential couple said in a joint statement that legal action became \"the only remaining avenue for remedy\" after Owens allegedly continued to promote the claims. Despite calls for retractions, Owens has stood firm in her position, declaring in a 2024 social media post that she would \"stake my entire professional reputation on the fact that Brigitte Macron is in fact a man.\" The U.S. lawsuit follows mixed results for the Macrons in French courts addressing similar allegations. In July, a Paris appeals court overturned lower court convictions against two French women who had made comparable claims about the first lady. The appellate court ruled that defendants Amandine Roy and Natacha Rey had acted in \"good faith\" despite making false claims, eliminating their financial liability for damages previously awarded to the Macrons.
