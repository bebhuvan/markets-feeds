    "fullContent": "Air Defenses Drastically Expand Around Putin Residence Where Rumored Girlfriend, Sons Live Various media reports in Europe as well as US state-funded publications have observed and reported on an unusually high number of air defense systems around President Vladimir Putin’s secluded Valdai residence. RFE/RL affiliate Radio Svoboda has claimed that's were Putin's girlfriend and their children live, according to a new investigation. \"Satellite images and photos from the Yandex.Zerkala mapping service show at least 12 Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile systems, many mounted on elevated towers, encircling the compound known as Uzhin,\" the Amsterdam-based Moscow Times writes of the report. Illustrative: Pantsir systems, via Sputnik Only two such units had been publicly and visually identified in the area before the new satellite imaging and mapping analysis. \"By comparison, in the Moscow metropolitan region, home to more than 20 million people, authorities have positioned around 60 such systems since the start of the war in Ukraine — just five times more than the number protecting the Valdai site,\" Moscow Times continues. So if it is accurate that at least a dozen Pantsirs are now protecting Putin's residence alone, this is indeed a signifcant build-up and density of anti-air units protecting a single high value location. The 'extra' units were reportedly redeployed from the St. Petersburg region - which could leave this northern and second most populous Russian city more exposed to drone attacks. The Kremlin has long vehemenly denied that Putin is having a relationship with 42-year old Alina Kabaeva, and the Russian leader has been well-known for keeping his private life and family extremly secretive and sheilded from any media scrutiny. Alina Kabaeva, pictured with Vladimir Putin. source: Kremlin.ru \"The investigative outlet Dossier Center has reported that the residence is used by Alina Kabaeva, the former Olympic gymnast who leads the National Media Group and is widely reported to be Putin’s long-term partner,\" Moscow Times notes. It's believed she spends much of the year at the Valdai residence with her two young sons. \"In February 2023, the investigative site Proekt reported that a dedicated home for Kabaeva had been built next to the Valdai residence, complete with its own private railway spur,\" the same report says. Various outlets have circulated the believed locations of the expanded air defense ring around Valdaii. Putin is due in Alaska Friday, where he'll be meeting with President Donald Trump to discuss the Ukraine war as well as bilateral US-Russia relations. Pro-Ukraine pundits have asserted all of this points to Putin's increased 'paranoia' in the face of now nightly and weekly large waves of drone attacks on sensitive Russian sites out of Ukraine. Meduza: There are now 12 air defense systems near Putin’s residence in Valdai. Up from just 2 a year ago. Ukrainian drone strikes on oil refineries and other high-value targets are so effective because Russia’s air defenses are too busy protecting an increasingly paranoid Putin. https://t.co/jsYGHrZsrT — Pekka Kallioniemi (@P_Kallioniemi) August 13, 2025 CNN and others are identifying that the host venue will be Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a combined US Air Force and Army installation in Anchorage. Alternative and civilian sites were looked at, but peak tourist season in Alaska reporteldy left few last-minute options. The Alaska summit was only unveiled and confirmed less than a week ago.

    "fullContent": "Malifornia: Millennials Are Fleeing The State In Massive Numbers Authored by Larry Sand via American Greatness, In a stunning report, StorageCafe reveals that California remains the “undisputed leader in outbound migration nationwide, with nearly 683,000 residents leaving the state in a single year, according to the latest available U.S. Census data.” The evacuees’ top destination is Texas, which welcomed approximately 98,000 former Californians in 2023 alone. Millennials are leading the migration to Texas, making up over 31% of all movers. They are followed by Gen Zers, who account for 20%, and Gen Xers, representing nearly 15% of those relocating. Interestingly, Californians moving to Texas tend to earn more than the national average across most age groups, highlighting the financial advantage of the move. The news from StorageCafe isn’t unique. U-Haul has released a new report, and for the fifth straight year, California topped its Growth Index—meaning more residents of the Golden State rented one-way U-Haul trucks to leave the state in 2024 than residents of any other state. Texas was the top go-to state. People are fleeing the formerly Golden State for various reasons—high crime rates, exorbitant taxes and insurance costs, clueless leadership, and a failing education system. Businesses are also packing up and going elsewhere. Major companies, including Chevron, SpaceX, and Charles Schwab, have departed California. In total, 441 businesses have left the state since 2018 and moved their headquarters elsewhere. High taxes, skyrocketing rent, soaring costs of living for employees, and excessive red tape are some of the reasons cited by the businesses that have exited, with, again, Texas being the primary destination state. On the education front, per the California Policy Center, 45 out of California’s 58 counties have experienced a decline in traditional public school (TPS) enrollment over the last decade. Over the past ten years, statewide TPS enrollment has decreased by more than 612,000 students. It’s important to note that California introduced transitional kindergarten during this period, which increased TPS numbers. When considering only grades K-12, enrollment has dropped by more than 762,000 since 2015. There are myriad reasons for parental dissatisfaction, but perhaps the most egregious is that the state has taken on a co-parenting role, perhaps best exemplified by AB 1955, which California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law in 2024. This troubling legislation prevents school districts from requiring staff to inform parents if their child chooses to change their gender. No other state in the country has enacted such a strict law. The “Support Academic Futures and Educators for Today’s Youth (SAFETY) Act” explicitly bans schools from enforcing any policies that mandate sharing “any information related to a pupil’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression to any other person without the pupil’s consent.” Still being considered by the legislature, AB 495, the “Family Preparedness Plan Act of 2025,” authored by Assemblywoman Celeste Rodriguez (San Fernando-D), claims to offer compassionate solutions for immigrant families facing sudden separations due to detention or deportation. However, critics—including attorneys, parental rights advocates, and faith-based organizations—warn that it dangerously redefines guardianship, removes parental rights, and creates legal loopholes that facilitate child kidnapping. Erin Friday, an attorney and president of Our Duty-USA, a parent-led advocacy group, calls AB 495 “a child trafficker’s and kidnapper’s dream bill.” “There is no background check, no welfare check, no court oversight, and no verification. All you need is a piece of paper and some form of identification, with no obligation for the adult handing the child over to verify the identification, and presto, someone walks away with your child,” she warned. Friday adds that a stranger can consent to medical treatments for the child, and the bill absolves the doctors from any liability if the adult giving consent does not have any actual legal connection to the child. In addition to the state legislature, many school districts across the state have crossed traditional barriers. Parents of students at Sage Creek High School in Carlsbad, California, are seeking answers after a self-described BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism, masochism) expert from a clinic offering trans surgeries was scheduled to speak at the school during a recent week dedicated to LGBTQ student support. In late March, parents started voicing their opposition to a decision to have Mita Beach, a representative of DAP Health—a medical clinic that offers gender transition surgeries—speak. This occurred during a lunchtime event in the cafeteria and was open to all students. As reported by RealClearPolitics, “After looking into his business websites and social media accounts, which contained at least one photo of Beach engaged in BDSM and listed workshops he’s led on ‘Kink 101’ and ‘Examining Self-Injurious Behavior, Erotic Play, and Body Modification,’ several concerned parents contacted the high school and district superintendent’s office.” If a parent wants to opt out of their local public school, the state obstructs their efforts. One particularly onerous measure is in the works. If enacted, AB 84, authored by Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi (D–Torrance), would divert millions in state funding from charter schools—funds meant for classrooms—and redirect them toward excessive oversight costs and increased bureaucracy. The most impacted? Charter schools that offer flexible options like hybrid learning, homeschooling, virtual school, independent study, and drop-in centers. Private choice in California? None, and not much hope for the future. On July 4, President Trump approved legislation allowing the federal tax scholarship program to proceed. The Educational Choice for Children Act (ECCA) provides a tax credit that individuals can use to lower their tax bills by donating money for private school expenses for students. The program is scheduled to begin in 2027. Individuals (not corporations) who donate can reduce their tax liability by $1 for every $1 donated to accredited Scholarship-Granting Organizations (SGOs), up to $1,700. The SGOs must be federally recognized 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations. The scholarships cover a range of educational expenses, such as private school tuition, tutoring, educational therapies, transportation, and technology. They can also assist with additional costs for students attending public schools. However, per the law’s final version, states can choose not to participate, meaning no students in those states would be eligible for the program. With California legislators in the pocket of the California Teachers Association, the powerful teachers’ union, participating in ECCA will not be an option for parents in the Golden State. The state’s educational problems go beyond K-12 schools. Colleges in California also face widespread antisemitism. For example, UC Davis—a major research university with 40,000 students—has a well-documented anti-Jewish problem. In April of last year, the StandWithUs Center For Legal Justice filed a formal complaint with the Department of Education, alleging “a pervasively hostile, antisemitic campus climate, with incidents of unlawful discrimination and harassment, for students.” Not surprisingly, in November, Davis was ranked as one of the most anti-Jewish universities in the country by the advocacy group StopAntisemitism, which gave Davis a grade of “F.” In the legendary “Hotel California,” the Eagles’ Don Henley famously sang, “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” Well, people are indeed leaving.

Eduardo Verdugo/AP Photo Mexican Security Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch stated on X that the extradition was carried out at the request of the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ), which has provided assurances it would not pursue the death penalty for those facing prosecution. El día de hoy, el @GabSeguridadMX, en coordinación bilateral y con pleno respeto a nuestra soberanía, trasladó a Estados Unidos a 26 personas vinculadas a organizaciones criminales que representaban un riesgo para la seguridad de México. La acción se realizó en estricto apego a… — Omar H Garcia Harfuch (@OHarfuch) August 12, 2025 Those handed over to U.S. custody from Mexico include leaders of the Sinaloa cartel, the Jalisco New Generation cartel, or CJNG, and the Northeast cartel, formerly known as Los Zetas. All 26 defendants face a range of criminal charges in the United States, including drug-trafficking, kidnapping, illegal use of firearms, human smuggling, money laundering, and the killing of a sheriff’s deputy. In a statement released by the DOJ, Attorney General Pam Bondi expressed gratitude to Mexico’s National Security team for their cooperation in carrying out the extradition. “These 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores—under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country,” Bondi stated. The extradition from Mexico to the U.S. marks the second of its kind this year, as the Trump administration intensified efforts to curb drug trafficking across the border. In February, Mexico transferred 29 cartel members to the United States, including Rafael Caro Quintero, a drug lord who is allegedly involved in the killing of a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in 1985. The U.S. Embassy said the latest extradition demonstrated the “growing depth of cooperation” between the two nations in tackling the threat posed by transnational terrorist organizations. “These fugitives will now face justice in U.S. courts, and the citizens of both of our nations will be safer from these common enemies,” U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said in a statement. Trump has raised tariffs on Mexican imports to pressure the country to take stronger action against drug trafficking, saying Mexico was not doing enough to curb the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants at the border. He announced a 90-day delay in U.S. tariff hikes on Mexican goods on July 31 to allow time for negotiations, but said that Mexico would still face an across-the-board 50 percent levy on aluminum, copper, and steel, as well as a 25 percent tariff on automobiles. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Aug. 8 ruled out allowing U.S. troops to conduct military operations within Mexico, after reports emerged that Trump has secretly directed U.S. military action against Latin American cartels designated as foreign terrorist organizations. “The United States is not going to come to Mexico with the military. We cooperate, we collaborate, but there is not going to be an invasion,“ Sheinbaum told reporters. “That is ruled out. Absolutely ruled out.” Ryan Morgan contributed to this report.
