    "fullContent": "These Countries Will Sell You A Passport For people unhappy with their passport and with the right amount of spare cash hanging around, acquiring a new nationality that - for example - awards visa-free travel to more countries is possible. As Statista's Katharina Buchholz reports, according to law firm Henley & Partners, a dozen countries around the world offer passports in exchange for investments and the large majority does not require applicants to move or even visit there. You will find more infographics at Statista The scheme is a way for small island states - mainly in the Caribbean - to receive some cash injections into their economies while sharing the wide-reaching visa-free travel priviledges their passports hold. A passport from St. Kitts and Nevis, for example, offers relatively hassle-free entry to 154 countries, not far off from the world record held by Singapore at 193. Other so-called golden passport countries follow close behind, including Antigua and Barbuda at 152 countries, Grenada at 147, St. Lucia at 146 and Dominica at 143. Outside the Caribbean, non-EU member North Macedonia has visa-free travel to 130 countries, Turkey to 114 countries and Nauru to 87 (at the lower rate of $130,000). Larger nations which offer passports for investment, also including Egypt and Jordan, advertise additional benefits their citizenship-for-investment schemes can offer, for example ease of accessing local markets and trade routes. Jordan and Turkey charge more than the $200,000 to $250,000 usual in Caribbean for this priviledge, while the Egypt investment stands at $250,000 also. Malta, as one of only two EU countries offering citizenship-for-investment, has the most stringent rules, including a three-year residence requirement and a five-year investment period. Austria, the second EU member included on this list, does not have set rules for its scheme, hinting at it being the hardest-to-acquire option. Both nations also have residence-by-investment schemes, a more common occurance in Europe and around the world, where investors are given (permanent) resident status first before later potentially having a path to citizenship. With more countries participating, price ranges for residence-by-investment are wider, while the program is not necessarily cheaper. European Union prices also reach as high as $500,000, while this is around $1 million in the United States (business founders only) and into several millions in the case of Singapore, New Zealand or Hong Kong.

    "fullContent": "How A Georgia County Put Its Election Results On Bitcoin, And Why It Will Transform Election Security By Juan Galt of Bitcoin Magazine, At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, held May 27-29 at The Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, Simple Proof CEO Carlos Toriello and Screven County, Georgia, Elections Supervisor Stacey Scott shared insights into their groundbreaking use of Bitcoin’s blockchain to secure election results. In an exclusive video interview, now released to the public, the duo detailed how Simple Proof’s hash-only timestamping technology is transforming document authentication while balancing transparency and privacy. The interview, conducted amid the conference’s 30,000 attendees, highlights the growing adoption of Bitcoin-based solutions in public recordkeeping. Bitcoin 2025 Exclusive: Simple Proof’s CEO and Screven County Elections Supervisor Discuss Blockchain’s Role in Election Integrity Featuring @carlostoriello @realSimpleProof via @BitcoinMagazine pic.twitter.com/iKFmEckIYp — JuanGalt.com (@JuanSGalt) August 12, 2025 Simple Proof, a tech startup leveraging Bitcoin’s OpenTimestamps protocol, made history in November 2024 when Screven County became the first U.S. county to secure its election results on the Bitcoin blockchain, specifically in block 869,047. Toriello explained in the interview, “Our hash-only solution allows organizations like Screven County to prove a document’s existence at a specific time without exposing its contents. This is critical for sensitive records like voter rolls, where privacy and integrity are paramount.” Stacey Scott, who oversaw the implementation in Screven County, added, “This technology gave us a way to ensure our election results were tamper-proof, building trust with our voters.” The hash-only functionality enables clients to generate cryptographic hashes — a kind of unique identifier derived from the data of the files using commonplace cryptography. The process can be done locally, ensuring sensitive data remains secure while anchoring a timestamp to Bitcoin’s immutable blockchain. This approach, as Toriello noted, addresses the dual need for transparency and confidentiality in government processes. Screven County’s adoption followed Simple Proof’s earlier success in timestamping Guatemala’s 2023 presidential election, a project Toriello credited with protecting both data integrity and his personal safety during his work as an election auditor. Beyond elections, Simple Proof is seeing growing interest from other sectors according to Toriello who highlighted potential applications in state archives, where historical documents like constitutions could be safeguarded against tampering, even by advanced threats like rogue AI or quantum computing. The company has also secured records for Williamson County, Tennessee’s Republican Party convention, signaling broader adoption in the U.S. South and beyond. Simple Proof’s induction into the inaugural class of the Strategy Bitcoin Hub at Strategy HQ underscores its rising prominence. The company’s technology, built on Bitcoin’s OP_Return and OpenTimestamps, creates unforgeable proof of document existence, scalable to vast datasets with minimal blockchain footprint. As Toriello emphasized in the interview, “This isn’t just about elections — it’s about preserving truth for any digital record, from historical archives to everyday transactions.” “Within a month of meeting Carlos we were able to secure our election results in Screven County Georgia. The great thing is it was super simple, I didn’t have to know anything about Bitcoin or the blockchain, all I had to do was send an email with the election results to Simple Proof and they were able to time stamp this on the blockchain,” Scott recalled in the interview with Bitcoin Magazine. Simple Proof’s work is reframing Bitcoin as more than a currency, positioning it as a tool for immutable recordkeeping, while using scalable technologies that respect the Bitcoin blockchain’s scalability concerns and best practices. With interest growing in regions beyond the U.S. South and in industries like legal and archival services, the company is poised to expand its impact. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 06:30",

When asked if China could make pledges worth billions of dollars like Japan, South Korea and the EU have as part of their trade agreements, Bessent said “my sense is no because a lot of the buyout or the funds from the buyout are going to go to critical industries that we need to reshore and a lot of those need to be reshored away from China.” Whether the industry was semiconductors, rare-earth magnets, pharmaceuticals or steel, “my sense is that isn’t what will happen,” Bessent said in an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday in the US.
