    "fullContent": "\"We'll Take Half World Down With Us\": India Outraged By Pak Army Chief's Nuke Threats From US Soil Pakistan’s Army Chief, General Asim Munir, has been on a tour of the United States over several days, which included attendance at a farewell function for the chief of the US Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla. The trip is said to be Gen. Munir's second visit in less than two months. While in Tampa (where CENTCOM's HQ base is located), Gen. Munir also spoke at a private event for the Pakistani diaspora in America. His words there have set off outrage and condemnation from India on Monday, including fresh nuclear sabre-rattling. \"We are a nuclear power. If we go down, we’ll take half the world with us,\" Munir reportedly had stated. What has heightened the anger in New Delhi is that this is the first time a top Pakistani official has issued an apparent nuclear threat from US soil. Pakistan’s Army Chief, General Asim Munir, file image. Munir also threatened to target infrastructure projects India might build on the Indus River, amid the recent conflict and diplomatic standoff over historic water rights treaties. Referring to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack of last April, he claimed it could lead to famine for 250 million people. \"Let them build a dam, and we’ll hit it with ten missiles,\" he was quoted as saying, adding, \"We have no shortage of missiles, al-hamdulillah [praise be to God].\" He also during the speech called India a shiny Mercedes, compared to \"dump truck\" Pakistan - in reference to military stregnth and impact: \"India is shining, a Mercedes coming on a highway like a Ferrari, but we are a dump truck full of gravel. If the truck hits the car, who is going to be the loser?\" he said in a \"crude analogy\". The top army chief had further raised eyebrows on the question of military intervention in government affairs: \"People say war is too serious to be left to the generals, but politics is also too serious to be left to the politicians,\" he said at the disapora event. The Indian government issued a statement condemning the remarks: India on Monday accused its neighbour Pakistan of \"sabre rattling\" and \"irresponsibility\" after media reports on remarks about nuclear threats in South Asia made by Pakistan's army chief while on a visit to the United States. The statement also accused Pakistan of using nuclear saber-rattling as its \"stock-in-trade\". The two neighboring countires, who have fought several historic border wars, have both been nuclear-armed for decades - a fact which has frequently been cause for alarm for the whole south Asia region. Additionally, an Indian lawmaker, Jairam Ramesh, responded Monday by saying: \"It is bizarre that the US establishment is giving such a man such special treatment.\" The White House has not weighed in and is not expected to, but it is also of course an ally of India, and the Indian Embassy in D.C. is likely going to try and seek answers. It’s condemnable that the US has provided a platform for Pakistan’s military leader, Asim Munir, to make provocative and inflammatory statements against India. pic.twitter.com/p5lsKh54GQ — John Brittas (@JohnBrittas) August 11, 2025 The Pentagon and US intelligence have long been close to Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment, especially related to anti-USSR activities (supporting the Afghan mujahideen) in the 1980s - as well as 'counterterror' operations in the Af-Pak region from the 1990s and into the 2000s.

    "fullContent": "Revealed: Shots Fired After Japanese Destroyer Breached Chinese Waters This weekend, Japan's Kyodo news cited high level diplomatic sources who revelaed for the first time a dangerous event between Chinese and Japanese naval vessels which unfolded a year ago. In July 2024, Chinese naval vessels fired at least two warning shots at a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) destroyer after it unintentionally entered Chinese territorial waters off Zhejiang Province, a coastal region in East China The destroyer, Suzutsuki, was described as monitoring Chinese military exercises in international waters when the incident occurred. The Japanese government sources seem to be admitting that it was the fault of the Japese vessel, as the explanation given in Kyodo is that the ship's electronic navigation system failed to display territorial boundaries. File image: US 7th Fleet. The destroy thus 'uknowingly' and inadvertently hcrossed directly into Chinese territorial waters, having come within 12 nautical miles (about 22 kilometers) of China's coast for approximately 20 minutes on July 4. Kyodo relates based on its sources: After repeatedly urging the Japanese destroyer to change course, the Chinese vessels fired a warning shot just before the Suzutsuki entered Chinese territorial waters and another after it had crossed into the area, the sources said. After Beijing logded formal protest over the incurion, Japan is reported to have 'unofficially explained' to Chinese officials that the captain was unware he had breached Chinese waters due to the technical malfunction. Underscoring how serious an incident it was, Japan's MSDF subsequently dismissed the destroyer's captain due to neglegence, and has kept its internal investigation into the incident a secret. However, Japanese officials are at the same time deeply uneasey that China's PLA Navy so quickly reverted to use of force in the form of live-fire warning rounds. The Kyodo report came out on Sunday, and interestingly just a day later, on Monday, there was another major incident involving the Chinese PLA Navy and other regional US ally, The Phillippines. Dramatic footage emerged showing two Chinese navy vessels colliding while chasing a Philippine patrol boat near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea - an area which has emerged as a geopolitical flashpoint between Manila and Beijing. General location of last year's incident between Japan and Chinese naval forces. Map via Encyclopaedia Britannica \"The (China Coast Guard vessel) CCG 3104, which was chasing the (Filipino coast guard vessel) BRP Suluan at high speed, performed a risky manoeuvre from the (Philippine) vessel's starboard quarter, leading to the impact with the PLA (People's Liberation Army) Navy warship,\" Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) officer Jay Tarriela said in a statement, quoted by AFP News. \"This resulted in substantial damage to the CCG vessel's forecastle, rendering it unseaworthy,\" Tarriela said, in a truly bizarre and somewhat unprecedented incident, illustrating the continued militarization of these disputed waters.

    "fullContent": "Jane Street's India Scandal: Is The World's Biggest Market Rigged? Authored by Tom Wright via WhaleHunting.com, At Whale Hunting, we investigate the hidden engines of global finance. Our latest story goes far beyond the headlines to reveal how one of the world's most powerful and secretive trading firms is at the center of a mounting scandal in India. Yes, we're talking about Jane Street – the same firm that trained disgraced crypto kingpin Sam Bankman-Fried and, by some estimates, accounts for over 10% of all North American equity market activity. Now, as Indian regulators probe allegations of market manipulation and privileged access to trading data, the firm’s extraordinary profits are under the microscope. This is a battle for the soul of a nation's fast-growing financial system, pitting the technological might of foreign firms against the millions of local investors who are consistently losing out. Can India protect its markets from a new kind of \"predatory\" capital, or is this a global game of whack-a-mole that regulators are destined to lose? Indian regulators are widening a probe into secretive U.S. trading firm Jane Street, launching an investigation into allegations the firm and other foreign high-frequency traders (HFTs) gained an unfair advantage through privileged access to proprietary trading data, according to two sources with knowledge of the action. This latest front adds to a mounting pile of allegations, including a sophisticated market manipulation scheme and a tax probe. The focus of the investigations is a handful of foreign firms that have made billions of dollars in profit from a distance, with a minimal local presence. The victims, regulators argue, are the millions of regular Indian retail investors who are overwhelmingly losing money in the very market the foreign firms are allegedly gaming. At its core, this is a story of a new kind of economic hegemony, where a handful of global firms, operating from hubs in New York, Hong Kong, and Singapore, are allegedly extracting immense wealth from India's markets. The sheer scale of the operation is staggering: while a recent Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) study found that 9 out of 10 individual traders lost money in the options market last year, the regulator's own filings revealed Jane Street alone amassed $4.3 billion in profits from January 2023 to March 2025. This raises a critical question: can India protect its fast-growing financial markets and the small-time investors who fuel them from what SEBI has referred to as \"predatory\" capital? The firm's profit from India, with a single day allegedly yielding over $81 million, is a vivid illustration of the lopsided nature of the market. This is a far cry from helping India's financial development, as the bulk of these profits are moved offshore through a web of entities designed to take advantage of tax treaties. Why India Became an HFT Magnet Foreign HFT firms were particularly drawn to India's burgeoning financial landscape for several key reasons. India's economy has been a story of remarkable growth, with real GDP expanding at a brisk pace and capital markets deepening significantly. This robust performance, despite some recent stock market weakness, has made India a prime destination for global capital. Furthermore, profits for HFT firms (featured in Michael Lewis' Flash Boys) have been under pressure in more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe, where regulatory scrutiny is tight and competition is fierce. India, with the world's biggest derivatives market by contracts traded, presented a lucrative new frontier. The National Stock Exchange of India, or NSE, in its aggressive push to become a global powerhouse, first allowed algorithmic trading in 2010. This paved the way for foreign HFT firms to enter the market and leverage their technological superiority to capitalize on the country's rising fortunes. Jane Street officially entered the Indian market in 2020, with other firms following suit, choosing to operate from overseas hubs with only a skeleton staff on the ground, allowing them to extract massive profits without building a substantial local presence. This drive to attract big players was particularly intense as the NSE prepared for a long-awaited and highly anticipated public stock listing, where higher trading volumes would translate directly into a higher valuation. This pursuit of global dominance, however, may have inadvertently – or intentionally – created a system with built-in advantages for a select few. The alleged data access being probed is reminiscent of the \"co-location scam,\" a separate historical scandal from the 2010s where local brokers were given preferential access to the exchange's servers, highlighting a broader, persistent concern about market fairness and a systemic vulnerability at the exchange itself. The Allegations and the Defense The Jane Street saga offers a powerful case study of this dynamic. The firm, known for its brilliant math whizzes who are trained to be market gamblers, gained notoriety as the training ground for Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, the disgraced crypto kingpins whose careers began at the firm. (Jane Street features prominently in Brazen's Crypto Kingpins podcast, available here.) Jane Street is accused by SEBI of using a \"banging the close\" strategy to manipulate the Bank Nifty index. This scheme, which allegedly made billions of dollars in profit, involves placing a large number of orders at the end of the trading day to artificially move prices and make the firm's other bets in options markets more profitable. In July, the regulator temporarily banned Jane Street from trading in Indian equities and put a freeze on $567 million of its funds. In response, Jane Street has pushed back hard, calling the allegations \"erroneous.” Legal experts note that proving market manipulation is a high bar for regulators, who must not only show that a firm benefited from market movements but also prove intent to manipulate. The firm's likely rebuttal is that its trades are simply exploiting market inefficiencies – a standard, and legal, practice in markets globally – and that profiting from market misalignment is not the same as illegal manipulation. In a parallel tax probe, the firm is also being investigated for allegedly using a web of offshore units to move profits out of India, with tax authorities reporting a lack of cooperation. This investigation addresses the concern that while HFT firms extract immense wealth from India's markets, they are not contributing their fair share of taxes locally. The tax probe and the public disclosure of high profits were key factors that led to wider scrutiny of the firm's operations. The ruthless competition among foreign firms became public in a New York court case where Jane Street sued rival Millennium Management over allegations that a profitable, India-focused trading algorithm was stolen by former employees, further highlighting the immense value these firms place on their Indian strategies. This court case, where Jane Street proudly disclosed that its India options market strategy had made $1 billion in profits in 2023 – around 9% of its estimated global profits of $10.6 billion for that year – is what first put the firm on SEBI's radar. The new probe into data access adds another layer of complexity. According to two people with knowledge of SEBI's actions, regulators are examining whether Jane Street, along with rival firms Citadel, Millennium, Susquehanna and others had an unfair advantage from enriched data sets sold by an NSE subsidiary. The regulator is looking into the use of this data, which included confidential details on client-type identification, hidden order quantities, and even the specific price levels of stop-loss orders. This level of detail could allow a firm to not only predict market movements with extreme accuracy but also to execute manipulative strategies, such as triggering a cascade of stop-loss orders to drive down prices. If the NSE made the data available for sale, it's not immediately clear that there was any wrongdoing on the part of the firms who legally purchased and used it. Such granular data sets are not available in the U.S. due to a stringent regulatory framework that protects trader anonymity and market fairness. U.S. exchanges and the SEC have strict rules preventing the dissemination of confidential information like client identities, hidden order quantities, or stop-loss levels. Providing this data would be considered a severe violation, enabling market manipulation and leading to swift enforcement action. The Stakes: A Game of Whack-a-Mole? The outcome of this probe will not only determine Jane Street's future in India but will set a precedent for how global high-frequency trading firms are regulated in emerging markets for years to come. SEBI's actions signal a clear intent to level the playing field, with the regulator’s chairman stating they \"have PhDs from our side\" and are not intimidated by the firms’ technological prowess. Yet, the broader question looms: will sophisticated traders simply find the next poorly regulated market to exploit? This dynamic is not new; it was a central theme in Michael Lewis's Flash Boys, which chronicled the early days of HFT in the U.S. While many of the most egregious strategies, like those tied to latency arbitrage, have been largely mitigated in mature markets, the core of HFT – leveraging speed and informational advantages to exploit market structure – remains a powerful and profitable engine. As regulators in one country close loopholes, these firms have a proven history of moving their operations to the next frontier, raising the possibility that this is a global game of whack-a-mole with local regulators constantly playing catch-up.

The World Robot Conference 2025 opened in Beijing on Friday, as a robotic host invited attendees to jointly inaugurate the event. The expo of the World Robot Conference features over 1,500 exhibits from more than 200 leading domestic and international robotics companies,… pic.twitter.com/4ABzwuZ9YX — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) August 8, 2025 What she found is that consumer interest in humanoid robots is beginning to rise. Her view is that the tech inflection point for these bots entering the real world is still 2 to 3 years away - certainly less than ten. At least 20 new humanoid robots were launched at the event. Here are Du's top takeaways from WRC: 1. Very strong family/consumer visitor traffic that we observed at the event as compared to 2025 WAIC in Shanghai. While the latter was more focused on broad AI academic and industry development topics with humanoid robot as a subset, and thus had more professional visitors, WRC is completely dedicated to robot technologies and product demos. This in our view suggests that near-term educational, companion and entertainment demand potential could be strong (aside from scientific study, AI model training, government, developers and stage performance demand etc). In the long term, we see this as an early indicator that as long as robot products are useful, affordable and safe enough, consumer demand potential could be very significant aside from manufacturing demand. Recently Unitree launched its new product R1 that is priced at Rmb39,900 (121cm/25kg/26 DOF) and Engine.ai announced plans to launch SA02 (125cm/25kg/26+2 DOF) soon at Rmb38,500, both of which could be targeting these demands with product specs that are also much more simplified. 2. Regarding the technology inflection point, the most positive comments we heard suggest that at least 1-2 years are still required to scale up data and enhance models for reinforcement learning (RL), or to transition to end-to-end operations after 1-2 years of rule-based operation. This is primarily because industrial settings are difficult to simulate, potentially requiring up to 70-80% of high-quality real-world data for effective training, per some comments. We also heard about practices such as multi-modal remote operation by humans as a bridge solution, provided low latency can be ensured (with two companies citing Tesla's new diner in Los Angeles where Optimus robots were observed serving popcorn). During his speech at the opening ceremony, Unitree CEO Wang Xingxing defined the robot's \"ChatGPT moment\" as actually being able to complete tasks with generalized skillsets in a completely new environment, which he said is at least 2-3 years away, but not more than 10 years away. That said, Google's new AI video generation model, Veo3, introduced in May 2025, which notably creates and incorporates audio (including dialogue, sound effects, and background music) and excels from text and image prompting to real-world physics and accurate lip-syncing, presents an interesting discussion point among robot companies. Its capabilities have raised the question of whether its underlying AI architecture could be even more optimal than Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL), which some have regarded as a primary AI solution for robotics and embodied AI since early this year. Therefore, we highlight that investors should be aware of potential product redesign risk given the ongoing, rapid co-evolution between software and hardware structures, as these two elements remain intrinsically linked in AI development. However, we are encouraged to see the industry's swift progress, with new advancements emerging every couple of months. A side note is that Nvidia has been very proactive at WRC, delivering keynote speech/seminars and showcasing its strategic initiatives in Physical AI and General-purpose Robotics, with its full-stack suite that encompasses cloud-scale model training, physics-based simulation (e.g., Isaac Sim/Lab) for synthetic data generation, and real-time edge AI deployment (e.g., Jetson AGX Thor). They have also recently newly introduced Cosmos Reason, an advanced Vision Language Model (VLM) designed to imbue robots with common sense and the ability to understand real-world scenarios. It is worth noting that almost every robot product is still using Jetson AGX Thor or the broader Jetson platform, per our checks. 3. There have been 20+ new products launched around this event (in July/Aug) out of total ~50 humanoid robot exhibitors (alongside another ~120 industrial robots and component companies). We saw variations across wheel-based and bipedal robots (with full rotary actuators or combination of rotary+linear). Overall product performance (WBC or whole body control) has improved quite significantly vs our visits in Feb/May in terms of speed and smoothness. All live demos functioned well from those companies that we saw and we came away positively surprised on this front. 4. In terms of applications, there were four major directions that we perceived: a) for education, show-room guide and stage performance purposes; b) standard platform for developers and scientific study/AI training purposes; c) manufacturing & logistics; and d) consumer/elderly care/companion. a) and b) are currently contributing the bulk of the volumes while for c), we were informed by companies we met that success rates for selective tasks such as pick and place, sorting, assembly and inspection has now reached 80-99.5% with further improvement mainly to address long tail and abnormal situations; while regarding whether robot operation speed (reasoning & execution) can match that of customers' product line, it seems that non-production line tasks are where those robot players are currently targeting in a pragmatic way to ramp up initial volumes, and also to adapt to future flexible manufacturing system (FMS) needs. We also learned that manufacturers value whole system efficiency (e.g. multi-robot collaboration) more than single robot efficiency against single human labor on the same task. An 18-month payback is considered reasonable by customers to place orders, per one company's comment. 5. On cost reduction, we perceived that among those robot players, domestic component ratio appears quite high (possibly ~80% already). They have also worked on the design optimization aspect this year to further lower cost with some hardware specs being lowered, we noticed. Going forward, volume leverage remains the key to bring the cost curve down. 6. In terms of recent government subsidies news, media reports suggest consumer purchase subsidies at Rmb1,500 per unit (on a single purchase exceeding Rmb10,000) and corporate purchase subsidies at Rmb250k per unit (on a single purchase exceeding Rmb5mn). These discounts are for in-store purchases at the \"E-Town Robot Consumption Festival\" in Beijing, which will run from Aug 2 to Aug 17. Online discounts are also available on JD.com: consumers and enterprises alike can get Rmb 600 off orders greater than Rmb 6,000, and Rmb 50 off orders greater than Rmb 500. (news link, link). In markets, the Solactive China Humanoid Robotics Index - a thematic equity index tracking Chinese companies involved in the commercialization of humanoid and robotics technologies - is up 27.5% on the year.

    "fullContent": "Is Your Data Held Hostage? There's A Ransomware Negotiator For That Authored by Chris Summers via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Mark Lance’s phone rings when a company’s data is being held hostage. Often, the perpetrators are demanding a ransom to return sensitive information. Mark Lance, a ransomware negotiator with Guidepoint Security, said early intervention is key in cyberattacks, as it helps manage expectations and outline options for victims. Courtesy of Guidepoint Security “The largest demand for one of our victims was $70 million,” said Lance, a ransomware negotiator with Virginia-based Guidepoint Security. Failure to pay is under the threat that the company’s information will be made public. “The earlier we get engaged, the better,” Lance told The Epoch Times. “In most circumstances … a client has already recognized that they’ve been a victim—they’ve been informed via ransom notes,” he said. “We help people recognize that even if there’s no intent on paying a ransom, there’s a tremendous amount of value in engaging the cyber criminals, because … you can still do things like delay the inevitable release of their information, which will allow for more time for the forensics and incident response work stream to make sure that they are patched.” Cyber attacks, usually involving ransomware, are being perpetrated against corporations and state-owned agencies in the United States every day. In the first half of 2025, a Comparitech report shows 208 ransomware attacks on government agencies globally, a 65 percent increase from the same period of 2024. Ransomware is a type of malicious software—or malware—that prevents a user from accessing his or her computer files, systems, or networks and demands that he or she pay a ransom for their return, according to the FBI. The average cost to the victim of a ransomware attack has risen from $761,106 in 2019 to an estimated $5.13 million in 2025, according toPurpleSec, a U.S.-based cybersecurity company. That includes the ransom payment itself, the recovery costs, and various indirect costs such as reputational damage. Lance, who has worked in cybersecurity for 25 years, said when he is called in at the early stage of an attack, the victim is usually still performing a business impact analysis. “They’re not necessarily sure what has fully transpired or has occurred within their environment, to know what they potentially need to do as next steps,” he said. By “environment,” Lance means all the hardware, software, and networks that support an organization’s operating systems. He said a ransomware negotiator can manage expectations and give the victim an idea of their options. He said he can buy valuable time, and also allow the victim to work with legal counsel to determine what sort of disclosure they are going to have to make to the public, to stockholders, to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other regulators. Lance said the threat actors also have to provide some sort of evidence that they have accessed the victim’s data, and will have to provide a file tree, which is a map of directories leading to the files they have accessed. “We can gather and glean information from those communications that can be shared, that they might not have otherwise. But yeah, the earlier [we are brought in], the better,” he said. Jeanette Manfra, chief cybersecurity official for the Department of Homeland Security, speaks during a briefing at the White House on Dec. 19, 2017. Manfra announced that the United States believes North Korea was behind the global WannaCry cyberattacks. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Lance said at an early stage he tries to figure out what the client wants from the communication with the ransomware gang, “and then we develop a strategy around that.” He said the initial strategy might be simply to delay while they find out more about the attack and how serious it is in terms of consequences. He said the victim might later decide they are willing to make a ransom payment, and he said, “Then our strategy changes into how we’re negotiating terms, like, do they need it quickly? Or do we have time? So our strategy will change based on the needs of the client and what they’re trying to get out of it.” Cyber Ransom Notes Most often, the ransom note is left as a message on an individual system, Lance said. The note will usually advise the victim not to try to touch any of the IT systems and to download a Tor browser, go to a website on the darknet, and initiate communications with the ransomware attackers.
