The new orders subindex came in at 46.4, and its three month average was 47.1. On Thursday the non-manufacturing index was reported at 54.2, and the new orders index at 51.3. The three month average for the headline index was 52.6, and for new orders 50.0.Here is the manufacturing and services numbers for the past three years:The economically weighted average for the month of June alone is 52.9,",

This does not feel expected or normal.One of my favorite exercises is to play out scenarios - what would you have expected to happen if a particular event occurred, and then examine the reality. No one would have expected the current outcome.
