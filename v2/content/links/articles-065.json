Broader use of foreign currency-denominated stablecoins could raise concerns about monetary sovereignty and, in some jurisdictions, erode the effectiveness of existing foreign exchange regulations. The principle of \"same risks, same regulation\" faces limitations in the context of stablecoins, highlighting the need for tailored regulatory approaches that address the nature and specific features of stablecoins.",

First, using customs and firm-to-firm transaction data that covers the universe of firms in Chile, we build the fossil fuel consumption and the direct CO2 emissions at the firm, sectoral, and aggregate levels. In line with the official national sources, the electricity generation sector is the most important contributor to aggregate CO2 emissions, followed by the manufacturing, transport, and mining sectors. Then, we study the role of input-output linkages in propagating CO2 emissions to the rest of the economy. To do so, we construct the production network and the carbon footprint at the firm level using firm-to-firm transaction data from the Chilean IRS, and we validate our results with the input-output tables approach used in th",

    "summary": "When challenged to justify past investment in slavery – or current investments in, say, fossil fuel extraction or arms manufacture – officials weigh the costs and benefits of potential reforms. In the wrong hands, the internal review or study can be little more than a PR exercise, allowing the institution to acknowledge past wrongs while sidestepping accountability. In Yale and Slavery, David W. Blight will have none of this.",

    "summary": "We develop a theory of first-mover advantage (FMA) grounded in decision-making ability and error propensity. Our simulation model demonstrates how small initial advantages compound through systematic differences in error rates between first- and second-movers. We show that FMA amplifies when both competitors have higher decision-making ability and when abilities are closely matched, whereas FMA increases for low complexity of the decision-making environment but decreases for higher complexity. To test these predictions, we analyze 3.66 million chess games, exploiting quasi-random assignment of move order and objective ability measures. Results strongly support our theory: FMA increases from 3.5% for low-ability players to 11% for high-ability players, peaks when competitors are evenly matched, and strengthens in complex decision environments. Move-level analysis reveals second-movers make larger errors when operating from disadvantageous positions under complexity, explaining FMA persi",

Leveraging granular cellphone geolocation and sociodemographic data for 3.3 million workers in a major urban labor market over two years, we find that in-person meetings with employees at a given firm significantly increase the likelihood of transitioning to that firm -- an effect that exceeds that of phone calls and digital messaging. The influence of face-to-face interactions varies across demographic and occupational groups, with meeting frequency and composition helping to explain heterogeneity by gender, income, employment type, and industry. Our findings highlight the importance of in-person interactions as a key driver of labor mobility and a fundamental mechanism underpinning agglomeration economies.",

    "summary": "Momentum is a key factor found across all asset classes. It is persistent and perhaps the most used of the major risk factors. A paper I had not read before provides more light on the topic by showing that you can have both reversal and momentum with 1-month returns if you sort on turnover. The low turnover decile shows short-term reversals, while the high turnover decile shows momentum. See \"Short-term Momentum\".Reversal and momentum can coexist once you account for turnover. Large liquid stocks are less sensitive to price pressure effects. The price pressure effect is the main driver for short-term price moves and reversals, but turnover does matter. Don't fight short-term reversal unless you account for the turnover issue.",

With the usual one week delay, continuing claims, on the other hand, rose 10,000 to a new 4.5+ year high of 1.965 million:I can’t help but note that although the above numbers are seasonally adjusted, it is clear there is some residual unresolved post-pandemic seasonality nonetheless, as ever since the beginning of 2023 we have seen low numbers at the beginning of the year, rising through midyear, and then falling back down through the Holiday season.On the YoY% change more useful for forecasting, initial claims were up 2.3%, the four week moving average up 1.3%, and continuing claims up 5.9%:This continues to forecast weakness, but no recession. Interestingly, while there has been no substantial increase in new layoffs, those who are out of work are finding a more difficult time finding new jobs, as is",

Using daily data, we identify which announcements prompt households to revise their expectations. We construct two shock series—assuming households are either sophisticated or naive—based on the surprise components of announcements. Labor market news strongly influences both general economic sentiment and inflation expectations. Even when inflation rises and unemployment falls, households respond more to unemployment shocks. Most changes in inflation expectations are driven by labor market shocks. During negative supply and demand shocks, unemployment remains the dominant driver.",
