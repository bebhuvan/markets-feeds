    "fullContent": "Australian Senate Gags Debate on Bill To Define A Man And Woman Authored by Monica O'Shea via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Labor and the Greens have blocked debate on legislation that would have provided a clear definition of a man and a woman in Australia. Symbols for male and female in a hardware store in Western Australia on July 13, 2025. Susan Mortimer/The Epoch Times Liberal Senator Alex Antic introduced the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Restoring Biological Definitions) Act 2025 at the end of the recent parliamentary session. The bill (pdf) specifically repeals the definition of gender identity and omits every occurrence of the word “gender identity.” In addition, the bill provides a clear definition for men and women and substitutes the word “different sex” with “the opposite sex.” “Man means a member of the male sex irrespective of age. Woman means a member of the female sex irrespective of age,” the bill states. Antic said the issue would not go away and described the situation as “absolutely unbelievable.” “The Bill was designed to protect women’s sport and women’s spaces but Labor and the Greens wouldn’t allow it to pass into the second reading,” he said in a post to X. Antic said the Bill’s aim was to restore the definitions of a man and a woman, which had been “deleted in 2013” by the Labor government. “Yes, you heard that right, as presently enacted, the Sex Discrimination Act has no working understanding of what constitutes a man or a woman,” he told supporters on Aug. 1. “My Bill also proposed to remove the concept of ‘gender identity’ from the Act altogether, which the Labor government added as a category of protected classes.” Unbelievable scenes today as Labor and the Greens blocked the passage of the debate of my Sex Discrimination Amendment (Restoring Biological Definitions) Bill in the Senate.https://t.co/bw94wd94OU — Senator Alex Antic (@SenatorAntic) July 31, 2025 Debate Halted The bill was shot down before it was able to proceed to a second reading. During parliament, Queensland Liberal Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate Paul Scarr pointed out that the Senate usually does not stop discussion at such an early stage. “While the Senate has the opportunity to reject a bill at the first reading stage, in practice, the first reading is almost always passed without opposition and is regarded as a purely formal stage. The coalition support these normal procedures as we have with many Greens, Labor or crossbench bills that we strongly opposed,” he said (pdf). At the first reading stage, the title of the bill is read out and a copy of the bill is read to members of parliament, with no debate. It is only at the second reading where debate takes place. Minister for Women Katy Gallagher raised concerns debate on the legislation would hurt children who identified as trans. “We do not agree with the Senate being a place where individual harm can be done to young people across this country. That is what would have happened had we allowed this bill to proceed in the normal course, and we won’t stand for it. Trans children deserve better from this chamber,” she said. Australian Greens Whip Nick McKim said they would not allow the Senate to discuss the legislation. “We know exactly what Senators Antic and [Matt] Canavan are up to here. They are introducing a bill that they want to use to provide a platform for transphobic people in our community to punch down on transgender Australians and, in particular, on trans kids,” he said. “Well, as far as the Australian Greens are concerned, we are never, never going to vote in this place to allow you to create that platform.” However, One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts raised concerns that Labor and the Greens were controlling debate. “What we’re seeing here is an example of control, and, always, beneath control there is fear. Of what are the Greens and their coalition partner, Labor, afraid?” The Coalition supported the bill progressing for debate, but this was blocked by the Labor and Greens majority, with 25 in favour of the bill moving forward and 36 against.

    "fullContent": "Trump's Base Fragments Further As He Demands States Support Israel Or Risk Disaster Relief Reuters reports that President Donald Trump has announced new restrictions barring federal disaster preparedness funds from going to states or cities that boycott Israeli companies, in a move which is sure to further divide Trump's base, given it's widely perceived even among many conservatives as flying in the face of America First. Critics have long argued that Republicans have been placing the foreign nation Israel's defense and funding needs ahead of American citizens' well-being. This certainly constitutes more evidence that this is the case. Monday's controversial order has resulted in an avalanche of online commentary and angry reaction. To receive aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), states must now demonstrate and confirm that there's no policy of severing business ties specifically with companies based in Israel. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's office has said that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will enforce anti-discrimination laws. The US administration has long characterized the international Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement as rooted in antisemitism. Critics have shot back that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not at all the same things. This would impact at least $1.9 billion which FEMA distributes annually related to natural disaster and other relief. According to Responsible Statecraft: To be eligible for $1.9 billion available in federal grants from FEMA for disaster preparation essentials, including emergency management salaries and rescue gear, U.S. states and cities must agree that they will not cut off “commercial relations specifically with Israeli companies.” In essence, signing a loyalty oath to another country. Reuters tallies that at least 34 US states currently have laws that prohibit boycotts of Israeli firms. For example, Governor Greg Abbott, where recent Texas anti-BDS legislation gained significant media coverage, has stated that \"anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies.\" It seems Trump wants to see all 50 states adopt such legislation. A move such as this - actually linking funds which would go to Americans caught in disasters and emergencies - to a litmus test of loyalty to a foreign power, is certainly unprecedented in American legal and FEMA history. It's getting lots of reaction on social media, in circles on the Right and the Left... Denying American victims of natural disasters aid if they are insufficiently supportive of Israel. Absolute insanity https://t.co/VDGybhM3Py — Krystal Ball (@krystalball) August 4, 2025 Ah, great, more America First https://t.co/1JJNpccnX4 — Curt Mills (@CurtMills) August 4, 2025 This is a good way to create hate and resentment for their favored group. How do they not understand this? — Rachael (@Rachael_wv) August 4, 2025 \"Israel First\" is trending on X in the US, with \"America Last\". pic.twitter.com/Ci4Uq0KLUg — MenchOsint (@MenchOsint) August 4, 2025 The Trump admin decision to withhold disaster relief funds is even more insane than I thought: It extends a ban on disaster funds from our tax dollars to anyone who refuses to deal with \"Israeli companies\" pic.twitter.com/xEM8YnKl4x — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) August 4, 2025 And this says it all as Trump's conservative base is continuing to fragment over the support to Israel issue, and as the growing humanitarian disaster in Gaza continues to spiral, resulting in fiercer and more polarized reactions globally...

    "fullContent": "Against The \"Impossible\" Authored by Josiah Lippincott via American Greatness, Earlier this year, I was talking with a prominent libertarian economist on matters of fiscal and monetary policy. I noted that, in my view, the core problem in this unholy nexus was the Federal Reserve’s ongoing dominance over the nation’s money supply and financial industry. It was critical, I said, that we dissolve the central bank. The inevitable consequence of credit expansion (money printing) is inflation and malinvestment. The very existence of the Federal Reserve robs savers of their purchasing power and occludes true market data, leading to investors pouring their limited resources into schemes that should not exist in a free market. In doing so, these investors did not place their funds into products that buyers actually want. This inevitably leads to cycles of boom and bust that are ruinous for the common good. I expected him to agree. After all, this was a libertarian economist; I assumed that ranting against the Fed, fiat money, and government interference would be his thing. Instead, he simply shrugged. Getting rid of the Fed is impossible, he told me. We therefore had no choice but to make our peace with this system and try to make it work as well as we could. “Impossible.” That word stood out to me. Precision in language matters. When we use a word, we should know what it means. We should not say things cavalierly. Without clear language, there can be no clear thought. If something is in fact impossible, then, of course, we should not spend time debating about it. It is impossible, for instance, to have the sum of the three angles of a triangle add up to any number other than 180 degrees. It is likewise impossible to drop a heavy weight from a height and expect it to float or for a human being to give birth to an oak tree. These things are truly impossible. By the rules of logic in the world we inhabit, certain things cannot be otherwise. They simply are. These brute facts are not a subject of deliberation. Nothing is to be done about them. We should be deeply wary, however, in assigning this status of immovable fact to things that, as it turns out, can be other than what they are. Just because a thing is difficult to accomplish or unlikely does not make it impossible. Political regimes can change. There are, for instance, many different kinds of governments on the earth, and they differ in crucial ways. Laws are made and unmade. People move. Governments come into being and are overthrown. There was, for instance, a time in this nation’s history when the Federal Reserve did not exist. There may come a time when it will once again cease to be. Congress brought the Federal Reserve into being by law. It could be undone by the same process. Human institutions do not possess the certitude and unchanging quality of the basic axioms at the heart of logical thinking. 2 + 2 has always and everywhere equaled 4, but the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991. That government has not always existed everywhere and always. Man has a nature. He always and everywhere has the same features. All men seek good things and avoid bad things. Men may disagree wildly about what those things are, but all of us are engaged in this fundamental pursuit. If a suicidal man thought he would be better off alive than dead, he would not kill himself. Moreover, we see that human beings always give birth to human beings. We all need to sleep, eat, and defecate. Man is always and everywhere a being unto death. These are unchanging realities for us. It is incorrect, however, to attribute an unchanging nature to things that are in fact changeable. I notice that on the American right, there is often a profound sense of pessimism and melancholy that stems from this error. Many an influencer, activist, or commentator I have known will proclaim a given policy or campaign to be “impossible.” They will write it off as unfeasible with a wave of the hand. It cannot be done. Why even try? This despairing view of reality has poisoned many great projects and prevented countless others from even getting off the ground. There are indeed many policy changes that are not wise to pursue or that require resources that would be better spent elsewhere. Trade-offs and opportunity costs are simply part of life. They are unchanging features of human action. But to say that a thing comes at a price or is difficult is not the same as saying it is impossible. Nor are crude references to statistics a substitute for thought. The odds of any given American becoming a billionaire are only 1 in 380,000, but those odds are not definitive statements about an individual’s ability to create a groundbreaking innovation (or utilize government regulations to monopolize a lucrative market). At the end of the day, pointing to aggregates is not enough to understand the individuals that are part of the whole. Averages can be useful politically and can even help guide personal decisions. But an average isn’t everything. It isn’t the last word. Precision in thought—knowledge of what we know and acknowledgment of what we don’t—is crucial for political life. Despair is a sin, and pessimism is not necessarily wisdom. You often can, it turns out, just do things. And you should! As the American right moves forward in the coming years, we need to remind ourselves of this core truth. Real change, both for good and ill, is always possible. It is an error to presume to have knowledge that we really don’t have. Both mindless optimism and free-falling pessimism are wrong. The latter is, among conservatives, more common than the former. It poses a greater spiritual danger. The temptation to sit on one’s hands, wishing and whining but never doing anything useful, is very powerful on the right. A whole legion of anklebiters, cranks, and dour-faced losers surrounds us. These people are a spiritual dead end. There is nothing to be gained, in the end, from complaining or fantasizing about an apocalypse in which action will then and only then become possible. We live in this world, right here, right now. We should focus on that! I don’t know, for instance, if we will succeed in my lifetime in eliminating the Federal Reserve. I am not certain that it should be the highest priority for conservatives in this moment. But I am certain that we cannot live in peace and freedom while the central bank burrows its way into every aspect of the American economy. The right thing to do is to oppose tyranny wherever it is found. We should be honest, if only to ourselves, about what needs to be done. We should never pretend that slavery is preferable to liberty or defeat to victory. We should fight. We should make a day of it. We should follow the words of Virgil’s Aeneid: Do not give in to evil but proceed ever more boldly against it! Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 20:55",

    "fullContent": "Bolsonaro Placed Under House Arrest By US-Sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court Head Late Monday there's been more escalation in the Trump-Brazil standoff over the legal fate of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The country's top justices have ordered him to be put under house arrest. The Supreme Court, which is still in the process of ruling on the Bolsonaro case - as he's accused of an alleged coup attempt against his leftist rival President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva - has now said he has defied a court order banning Bolsonaro from social media. Jair Bolsonaro and justice Alexandre de Moraes. source: Secom/TSE They say he's attacking the nation's institutions while still on trial, and after he's already wearing a ankle monitoring brace. Brazil has faced US sanctions (targeting among others Bolsonaro's main rival and man driving what Trump has called a \"witch hunt\" - Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes) as well as the highest tariff rates in the world. Moraes himself issued the house arrest order, despite now being specifically targeted by the Trump administration. \"Moraes said Bolsonaro had violated precautionary measures imposed by the court restricting the former president’s social media usage and political messaging,\" according to Al Jazeera. Moraes has said that Bolsonaro, who was president of the country between 2019 and 2022, has spread messages with \"a clear content of encouragement and instigation to attacks against the Supreme Court and a blatant support for foreign intervention in the Brazilian Judiciary.\" Trump's recent heightened intervention has added fuel to the fire, and the standoff has intensified, with the Lula government so far having refused to bend the knee. Bolsonaro's family members have also been very vocal, often acting as 'messenger' - for example hailing Trump's punitive actions targeting the Supreme Court and Lula officials. Brazilians are against the tyranny of Alexandre de Moreas and Lula.

They, with Trump, want a full pardon for Bolsonaro and his officials which have been persecuted with him. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 20:30",

    "fullContent": "Trump Says Americans Could Get Dividends From Tariff Revenues Authored by Aldgra Fredly via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), President Donald Trump suggested on Sunday that his administration could distribute dividends from tariff revenues to Americans with certain income levels. US President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a reception with Republican members of Congress at the White House on July 22, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One, Trump said that a distribution of dividends to selected U.S. households is possible, even as the government works to pay down the national debt. “We have a lot of money coming in, much more money than the country has ever seen, by hundreds of billions of dollars,” he said. “There could be a distribution for dividends to the people of our country. I would say for people that would be middle-income people and lower-income people, we could do a dividend.” He also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to lower drug prices, in line with his May 12 executive order that requires drug manufacturers to offer American consumers “the most-favored-nation lowest price” for prescription drugs. “We‘ll be dropping drug prices, it will start over the next two to three months, by 1,200, 1,300 and even 1,400 percent,” he said. “We will pay as low as the lowest nation in the world.” Trump did not specify the potential amount of dividends he could distribute. The U.S. government collected $28 billion in tariff revenues in July, marking a record monthly high and bringing the total revenue for the fiscal year to more than $151 billion, according to Treasury data. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told last month’s cabinet meeting that tariff collections could reach $300 billion by the end of the year, as a result of Trump’s trade campaign. Trump imposed a 10 percent baseline tariff on nearly all U.S. trading partners in April, along with reciprocal tariffs that vary depending on their trade barriers with the United States, as part of an effort to address trade deficits. He later implemented a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs, before extending the reprieve to Aug. 1 to allow time for negotiations. The president signed an executive order on July 31 imposing reciprocal tariffs of between 10 percent and 41 percent on more than 60 U.S. trading partners. The new tariff rates, which are set to take effect on Aug. 7, were determined based on whether each nation has reached an agreement with the United States and the nature of those agreements. In his order, Trump stated that some trading partners have agreed to or are close to making “meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States,” while others have proposed terms that he thinks fail to adequately address trade imbalances or “align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters.” “There are also some trading partners that have failed to engage in negotiations with the United States or to take adequate steps to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters,” the order stated. The Trump administration is working on a trade deal with China, which is subject to an extended deadline through Aug. 12, following a May 12 agreement in which the two largest economies agreed to lower tariffs and roll back certain trade restrictions for 90 days.
