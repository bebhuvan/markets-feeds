Our analysis shows that excess mortality led to an increase in patenting activity in counties with high pre-war education levels, driven predominantly by innovations in labor-saving technologies. Our estimates imply that an additional 6,000 patents were filed in the 15 years following the war, amounting roughly to the average annual number of patents filed pre-war. We find a positive association between war-related mortality and wage growth as well as with the adoption of machines in the agricultural sector, providing additional evidence that incentives to escape labor scarcity are driving the innovation response to mortality.",

This chapter develops a framework whose goal is to survey and synthesize the answers that regional and urban economists have given to this question. Emphasis is placed on theoretical results about sufficient statistics that capture approximate impacts in both distorted and undistorted economies, as well as how new advances in data collection and causal inference are poised to leverage these theoretical results and thereby modernize and extend standard templates for infrastructure and policy evaluation. The chapter concludes with discussions of optimal policy, political economy, and practical matters of infrastructure provision.",

    "summary": "Competition authorities increasingly rely on economic screening tools to identify markets where firms deviate from competitive norms. Traditional screening methods assume that collusion occurs through secret agreements. However, recent research highlights that firms can use public announcements to coordinate decisions, reducing competition while avoiding detection. We propose a novel approach to screening for collusion in public corporate statements. Using natural language processing, we analyze more than 300,000 earnings call transcripts issued worldwide between 2004 and 2022. By identifying expressions commonly associated with collusion, our method provides competition authorities with a tool to detect potentially anticompetitive behavior in public communications. Our approach can extend beyond earnings calls to other sources, such as news articles, trade press, and industry reports. Our method informed the European Commission’s 2024 unannounced inspections in the car tire sector, pr",
