    "fullContent": "Russia's Fuel Exports Plummeted in July By Charles Kennedy of OilPrice.com Shipments of refined petroleum products out of Russia declined by 6.6% in July from the previous month, Reuters estimates showed on Wednesday, as domestic demand rose and capacity under planned maintenance increased. Port of Murmansk Russian seaborne fuel exports fell to 8.67 million metric tons last month, with shipments from the Baltic ports, the Black Sea and Sea of Azov ports, and the Arctic Murmansk and Arkhangelsk ports all down in July compared to June. Only the fuel shipments from the Far Eastern ports rose in July from a month earlier as most maintenance works at refineries in the area were completed, according to the data provided by industry sources and calculated by Reuters. Going forward, Russia’s refined product shipments could fall further in August, while crude oil exports could rise, as several refineries sustained damages during Ukrainian drone strikes earlier this month. A Sunday drone attack on the Saratov refinery, owned by Russia’s oil giant Rosneft, prompted the facility to halt the intake of crude oil, a source with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg on Monday. The Saratov Refinery in the Volga region has the capacity to process 140,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, but it has now been forced offline due to Ukrainian drone strikes. The refinery has become the third Russian crude processing facility to have been damaged by Ukrainian drone strikes so far in August. The halt to three major refineries would mean that Russia will see lower domestic gasoline and diesel supply while it will have more crude available for export as it doesn’t have too much storage for the unprocessed crude. Last week, reports emerged that Russia is preparing to sharply increase crude oil exports this month after Ukrainian drone strikes disabled major refineries, prompting a shift toward western port shipments. Crude shipments from Russia’s western ports could increase to 2 million bpd in August, about 200,000 bpd more than previously planned, sources told Reuters last week.

    "fullContent": "Sex On The Moon: Inside NASA's Most Unusual $21 Million Heist In July 2002, 24-year-old NASA intern Thad Roberts — a triple major in physics, geology, and geophysics at the University of Utah — carried out one of NASA’s most audacious thefts. Struggling financially and supporting a wife back home, Roberts devised what he believed was a foolproof plan: steal a 600-pound safe from Houston’s Johnson Space Center containing lunar samples from every Apollo mission and a meteorite, together valued at $21 million, according to the NY Post. His first step was finding a buyer. With help from friend Gordon McWhorter, Roberts connected online with a Belgian interested in paying $1,000–$5,000 per gram. The buyer, however, alerted the FBI, which told him to keep talking while agents investigated. Around this time, Roberts began a whirlwind romance with 22-year-old NASA intern Tiffany Fowler. After just three weeks of dating, Roberts told her about the plan — and she agreed to help. They recruited another intern, Shae Saur, and one night used their NASA IDs to slip into the lab and wheel out the entire safe. The NY Post writes that at a hotel, they sawed it open. On July 20, the 33rd anniversary of the first moon landing, Roberts and Fowler drove to Orlando to meet associates of the “buyer.” While waiting, Roberts hid moon rocks under the bed covers. Roberts (Photo: NY Post) “I take some of the moon rocks and I put them underneath the blanket on the bed … I never said anything but I’m sure she could feel it,” he told CBS News in 2012. “It was more about the symbol of what we were doing, basically having sex on the moon. It’s more uncomfortable than not, but it wasn’t about the comfort at that point. It was about the expression. And no one had ever had sex on the moon before. I think we can safely say that.” When the meeting came, it wasn’t buyers waiting — it was undercover FBI agents. The rocks were recovered, but the FBI said they were now “virtually useless to the scientific community,” and the theft also destroyed 30 years of a NASA scientist’s handwritten research notes. After his arrest, Roberts admitted to also stealing dinosaur bones and fossils from the Natural History Museum in Salt Lake City. “We weren’t going to take this money we were getting from it to go buy a yacht or lots of cars or a big house,” he told CBS. “We were gonna live just the small kind of lifestyle we were, but fund science that might change the world, you know?” Roberts, Fowler, and Saur pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit theft and interstate transportation of stolen property. Roberts got eight years in federal prison, serving six; Fowler and Saur each received 180 days of house arrest and 150 hours of community service. McWhorter, convicted at trial, was sentenced to six years. Roberts and Fowler never saw each other again. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 20:30",

    "fullContent": "French Fries Versus Baked Potatoes: One Raises Diabetes Risk 20 Percent, The Other Doesn't Authored by Rachel Ann T. Melegrito via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Potatoes have long had a bad rap for being high in carbs. A new study backs that concern—at least in part. That weekly french fry habit could be setting you up for diabetes decades down the road. Research found that eating french fries just three times a week may significantly raise Type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk—but, surprisingly, other potato preparations showed no increased risk at all. RaraAvisPhoto/Shutterstock “Our findings suggest it’s not fair to put all potatoes in the same basket,” lead author Seyed Mohammad Mousavi told The Epoch Times. How You Like Your Potatoes Matters The study, led by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, tracked more than 205,000 adults across three major U.S. observational health studies for 30 years. Participants regularly reported what they ate, along with details about their health and lifestyle. The study found that every three extra servings of potatoes per week was associated with a 5 percent increase in T2D risk. For french fries, that jump was even higher—20 percent per three servings. In contrast, eating baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes was not associated with an increased risk, suggesting that french fries are the main driver behind the link between potatoes and diabetes. French fries are often loaded with salt, which can raise blood pressure and trigger inflammation, increasing the risk of T2D. However, it’s more than just the fat and salt content driving the diabetes risk. “French fries are typically deep-fried at very high temperatures, which can produce harmful compounds,” Mousavi said. One such compound is acrylamide, formed during browning and linked to inflammation, insulin resistance, and blood vessel damage. “Due to their deep-fried nature, they [fries] are also much higher in calories than baked or mashed potatoes,” said Melissa Mitri, a registered dietitian-nutritionist and owner of Melissa Mitri Nutrition, who was not involved in the study. The large amounts of oil used in frying also introduce trans fats, which further increase insulin resistance and inflammation. Combined with the high-temperature cooking that breaks down resistant starches, french fries become a perfect storm for blood sugar chaos. Potatoes and T2D Even outside of french fries, people who ate seven or more servings of potatoes per week had a 12 percent higher risk of developing T2D. The risk rose with greater intake. While preparation plays a key role in how potatoes affect diabetes risk, it’s worth noting they still have a high glycemic index, meaning they can rapidly raise blood sugar. Potatoes are a common source of carbohydrates, especially starch, which the body quickly breaks down into sugar. Because of this, eating potatoes can cause a sharp rise in blood sugar levels soon after a meal. Frequent blood sugar spikes force the pancreas to release more insulin repeatedly. Over time, this constant demand can cause insulin-producing cells to wear out or stop working properly. This contributes to insulin resistance and reduced insulin production—both key drivers of T2D. A potato’s glycemic index, which ranks how quickly and how much foods raise blood sugar levels after eating, depends on how they’re prepared. A higher glycemic diet is associated with an increased risk of developing T2D because the foods cause a rapid and significant rise in glucose levels. Mashed and boiled potatoes have higher glycemic indexes because cooking breaks down their structure and makes the starch easier to digest, leading to faster spikes in blood sugar. Deep frying also softens the starch inside, but the hot oil forms a crust with some resistant starch that slows digestion. The fat in fries also helps slow down how quickly sugar is absorbed, making their glycemic index a bit lower than mashed or instant potatoes. Using different food preparation methods can reduce potatoes’ risks: Chill potatoes after cooking to increase their resistant starch content, slowing digestion and causing a more balanced rise in blood sugar. Bake or boil potatoes with the skin to retain more fiber and micronutrients. Boil, bake, or roast potatoes with minimal oil instead of frying to avoid added fats. Air fry potatoes to reduce the formation of harmful compounds produced by deep frying. Replacing potatoes with other carbohydrates reduced T2D risk. Swapping mashed, boiled, or baked potatoes for whole grains like pasta, bread, or farro lowered diabetes risk by 4 percent, while replacing french fries cut it by 19 percent. Substituting fries with whole grains, legumes, brown rice, or vegetables also reduced risk by 19 percent. The only swap that increased risk was white rice, which was linked to a 3 percent higher risk of T2D. This may be because white rice has a high glycemic index. “White rice is stripped of fiber and nutrients, digests quickly, and causes sharper spikes in blood sugar,” Mousavi said. Whole grains have fiber that slows digestion and causes smaller blood sugar spikes. Effects Surface Years Later Perhaps most concerning, the study found that potato intake 12 to 20 years before diagnosis had the strongest association with diabetes risk—suggesting dietary choices in your 20s and 30s could determine your health in your 50s and 60s. Type 2 diabetes develops gradually, with insulin resistance and inflammation starting decades before symptoms appear. Who’s Most at Risk Even after adjusting for genetics, diet, and lifestyle, the link between french fries and diabetes remained strong. It was especially pronounced in people with higher body mass index (BMI) and in white participants. Mitri noted that excess weight is tied to inflammation. “Someone with a higher BMI may have more difficulty responding to insulin,” she said, which can worsen insulin resistance. “So for people with higher BMI, the same amount of potatoes may have a bigger impact on diabetes risk,” Mousavi said. The study also found that people who ate more potatoes often took in more calories, sugary drinks, and red meat, and were less physically active—factors that can raise diabetes risk.

    "fullContent": "US Reactivates Military Intelligence Unit On Korean Peninsula In Latest Build-Up Via The Libertarian Institute The Pentagon activated a military intelligence unit in South Korea. The move comes after the US established a second fighter \"super squadron\" on the Korean Peninsula. According to a statement from the US Army, the 528th Military Intelligence Company (MICO) is now operating in South Korea. The 528th will be part of the Second Infantry Division. US Army file image \"2ID is the last remaining permanently forward-stationed division in the U.S. Army. Its purpose is to deter aggression and maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula, and if deterrence fails, ‘Fight Tonight’ in support of the U.S.-Republic of Korea Alliance,\" the Army’s statement explained. The 528th was established during World War II and deployed to the Korean Peninsula during the Korean War. The 528th was disbanded in 2005, after deployments during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. According to the statement, the MICO will be \"utilized to collect, analyze, and disseminate information about enemy forces, terrain, and potential threats to support decision-making and ensure mission success.\" The reestablishment of the military intelligence company follows the Pentagon repositioning dozens of F-16s in South Korea closer to the demilitarized zone. Additionally, Washington and Seoul are set to kick off large-scale war games that often lead to a spike in tensions on the Korean Peninsula. However, the US and South Korea agreed to divide the war games, and will conduct half of the planned military exercises in September. Last month, Pyongyang said it was not interested in bilateral talks with Seoul, but was open to talks with Washington so long as the US dropped its demand for North Korean denuclearization.

    "fullContent": "Netanyahu Says He Backs 'Greater Israel' - Drawing Outrage From Arab States Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has unleashed fresh controversy and anger among Arab countries and leaders by suggesting a huge land expanse of Israel's borders in an interview he gave to i24 News. In the newly published interview he said he is on a \"historic and spiritual mission\" and expressed strong attachment to the vision of a Greater Israel, which is a longtime reference to Israel encompasing parts of Jordan, Egypt and Syria - along with the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Map of 'Greater Israel'. Source: DeviantArt It comes on the heels of some hardline Israeli officials and settler groups loudly proclaiming that soon Israeli forces will be in Damascus. This is all based on Biblical concepts of what God is said to have promised the Jews thousands of years ago. The interviewer had presented Netanyahu with an amulet featuring what he described as a \"map of the Promised Land\" - with the image symbolically depicting the greatly expanded vision of Israel's future. Netanyahu when asked if he feels a connection with this concept of a Greater Israel, responded \"Very much\". The interviewer himself is known to back radical settler ideologies which seek to take land by force from neighboring Arab communities. Among the first regional governments to condemn the remarks has been Jordan. Jordan’s Foreign Ministry highlighed the 'Greater Israel' remarks, commenting that it constitutes \"a dangerous and provocative escalation, a threat to the sovereignty of states, and a violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.\" The ministry further emphasized \"the need for the international community to act immediately to stop all provocative Israeli actions and statements that threaten the region’s stability and international peace and security.\" Netanyahu claims he is on a ‘historical and spiritual mission’ to realize ‘Greater Israel’ pic.twitter.com/T2z3L1mnQd — HatsOff (@HatsOffff) August 12, 2025 Some war monitors fear that the Netanyahu government is in effect already trying to enact this - given that from the start of post-Assad Syria (last December), Israel's military quickly expanded the Golan occupation far beyond, into southern Syria. This is to the point where currently there are reports saying IDF ground forces are a mere dozen kilometers from the outskirts of the capital Damascus. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 18:50",
