    "fullContent": "White House Orders DEI Review Of Smithsonian Exhibits Ahead Of Nation's 250th Birthday Authored by Victoria Friedman via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), The White House on Aug. 12 ordered an internal review of selected Smithsonian museums and exhibitions to ensure that all public-facing content aligns with President Donald Trump’s directive to celebrate U.S. exceptionalism. People visit the Smithsonian National Museum of American History on the National Mall in Washington on April 3, 2019. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo In a letter sent to Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch III, the White House outlined the steps that it expects the organization to take in the review, including examining websites, social media content, and educational materials “to assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals.” The review comes as the country prepares to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, with White House officials saying that “it is more important than ever that our national museums reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story.” The review will initially focus on eight museums—including the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and the National Museum of the American Indian—with additional museums to be reviewed in a second phase. This initiative “aims to ensure alignment with the President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,” White House officials stated in the letter. The letter referenced Trump’s executive order, “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” signed on March 27. The order aims to counter the “revisionist movement,” which Trump described as a concerted effort to rewrite American history and replace facts with “a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.” Trump singled out the Smithsonian in the order, saying it had come under the influence of a “divisive, race-centered ideology.” ‘Focusing on Americanism’ The Smithsonian has been asked to provide the White House team with several documents—some due within 30 days of receiving the letter—including its programming for the 250th anniversary, exhibition plans and supporting materials, and lists of invited speakers and events. Scheduling interviews with curators and senior staff, the submission of other documentation, and the finalizing of updated plans to celebrate the nation’s birthday are expected within 75 days. Within 120 days, museums have been directed to begin implementing content corrections, where necessary, “replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions across placards, wall didactics, digital displays, and other public-facing materials.” White House officials stated in the letter that they viewed the process as a collaboration and an opportunity for museum staff to “embrace a revitalized curatorial vision rooted in the strength, breadth, and achievements of the American story.” “By focusing on Americanism—the people, principles, and progress that define our nation—we can work together to renew the Smithsonian’s role as the world’s leading museum institution.” The Smithsonian Institution is a “museum, education and research complex of 21 museums and the National Zoological Park, as well as research facilities,” and is about 62 percent federally funded, with its federal budget totaling more than $1 billion, according to its website. The Smithsonian Institution told The Epoch Times in an emailed statement on Aug. 13: “The Smithsonian’s work is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history. “We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents.” Rolling Back DEI The review is in line with the Trump administration’s wider efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion ideology from government, education, the military, and other U.S. institutions. In February, Trump removed the board of trustees at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, installing a new board with himself as chairman. The president had criticized the Kennedy Center for promoting what he called “anti-American propaganda” and promised to realign its mission with his “vision for a Golden Age of American Arts and Culture.” On Jan. 29, Trump signed an executive order laying out his administration’s plan for the United States’ 250th Independence Day celebration next year. The White House said this executive order will fulfill Trump’s 2024 campaign pledge to bring “not just one day of celebration, but an entire year of festivities across the nation.” Ryan Morgan contributed to this report.

    "fullContent": "Google Busted Sending GOP Fundraiser Emails Directly To Spam: Memo A Republican consulting firm is warning that Google’s Gmail platform is disproportionately flagging Republican fundraising messages as spam while allowing similar Democratic solicitations to reach inboxes. SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images In a memo to clients obtained by The New York Post, Targeted Victory - whose roster includes the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee - described the filtering pattern as “serious and troubling,” saying it continued as recently as June and July. The firm said emails containing links to the Republican fundraising platform WinRed were, “in many cases, sending them directly to spam,” while identical test messages with links to the Democratic platform ActBlue were “delivered without issue.” “If Gmail is allowed to quietly suppress WinRed links while giving ActBlue a free pass, it will continue to tilt the playing field in ways that voters never see, but campaigns will feel every single day,” the memo said. Video demonstrations of the firm’s testing were included. The allegations come despite previous scrutiny of Gmail’s email filtering practices. In 2023, the Federal Election Commission dismissed a Republican National Committee complaint alleging political bias in Gmail’s spam algorithms. A year earlier, a federal judge dismissed an RNC lawsuit making similar claims. Critics, including President Donald J. Trump, have long accused Google of political interference, alleging that the company has manipulated search results to disadvantage Republicans and, in one instance, suppressed news of an assassination attempt against Mr. Trump. In March, Elon Musk wrote on social media that Google had interfered “to help Democrats thousands of times every election season.” Google has denied wrongdoing. “Email filter protections are in place to keep our users safe,” José Castañeda, a company spokesman, said in a statement Wednesday. “They look at a variety of signals – like whether a user has previously marked an email as spam – and apply equally to all senders, regardless of political ideology.” Research has previously identified differences in filtering. A 2022 study by North Carolina State University found that Gmail flagged 59 percent more Republican fundraising emails as spam than Democratic ones during the lead-up to the 2020 election. “We observed that the [spam filtering algorithms] of different email services indeed exhibit biases towards different political affiliations,” the researchers wrote at the time. According to the Targeted Victory memo, the firm first contacted Google about the issue on June 30 after receiving complaints from clients. Google, the memo said, initially “deflected” the concern by “blaming local settings” for the filtering behavior. The firm’s tests involved sending identical emails to Gmail accounts, with the only difference being a WinRed or an ActBlue donation link. “The only difference between the two emails was the link,” the memo said. “ActBlue delivered. WinRed got flagged. That is not a coincidence.” “This held true even for major accounts, including Trump and Elise Stefanik links, compared to DNC links,” the memo continued. After what it described as weeks of back-and-forth, Google’s support team acknowledged that WinRed links were deemed “suspicious” and, in some cases, flagged with a red banner warning that the message was “potentially suspicious or unsafe,” according to a screenshot dated July 22. “This should alarm every campaign and committee that relies on email to connect with voters,” the memo concluded.

    "fullContent": "45 Arrests Made In Washington On Wednesday: FBI Director Authored by Jackson Richman via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), WASHINGTON—There were 45 arrests made in Washington on the evening of Aug. 13, according to FBI Director Kash Patel, as President Donald Trump’s quest to fight crime in the nation’s capital continues amid the federal government’s takeover of the city’s police department. Members of the National Guard patrol at Union Station in Washington on Aug. 14, 2025. Madalina Kilroy/The Epoch Times “The FBI and our partners made 45 arrests—29 immigration-related, 16 tied to the violent crime surge, and 3 firearm seizures,” Patel wrote on X. 🚨OVERNIGHT IN DC 🚨 The FBI and our partners made 45 arrests - 29 immigration-related, 16 tied to the violent crime surge, and 3 firearm seizures. Charges include: 🟥Assault on a federal officer 🟦Possession of child sex abuse material 🟥Illegal firearms 🟦Drug trafficking… — FBI Director Kash Patel (@FBIDirectorKash) August 14, 2025 Charges against those arrested included assault on a federal officer, possession of child sex abuse material, illegal firearms, and drug trafficking. There were also fugitive apprehensions and an arrest for someone throwing a Subway sandwich at an officer. The last crime was caught on a 29-second video. It shows a man facing an officer, looking away for a moment, and then throwing the sandwich at him. The man runs away, crossing the street, and is chased by officers. The officers eventually catch up to him. “The @FBI arrested this individual last night. He has been charged with felony assault on a federal officer,” Patel said on X, accompanied by a video of the incident. The subject was an employee of the Department of Justice, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi. He has since been fired, she said. Trump has instructed federal law enforcement to patrol Washington for 24 hours every day. The federal government can control the city’s police department for 30 days. Congress must approve any extension. The president said the extension will be necessary. “We’re going to be asking for extensions on that—long-term extensions,” he said on Aug. 13. “You can’t have 30 days.” Trump announced on Aug. 11 that the federal government would take over Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department. “This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we’re going to take our capital back,“ Trump said at a press conference. ”We’re taking it back under the authorities vested in me as the president of the United States.” He said that Bondi is “taking command of the Metropolitan Police Department” and that Terry Cole, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, is “designated as the interim federal commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department.” In addition to signing an executive order declaring a crime emergency in the nation’s capital, Trump signed a presidential memorandum to send the National Guard into the city. The National Guard does not have the authority to arrest people, although they can detain them until law enforcement arrives. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser has criticized Trump’s actions, calling them “unsettling.” “My message to residents is this,” she said at an Aug. 11 press conference. “We know that access to our democracy is tenuous. That is why you have heard me and many Washingtonians before me advocate for full statehood.” Bowser told MSNBC on Aug. 10, “We are not experiencing a crime spike.” In addition to crime, the Trump administration is looking to fight homelessness. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Aug. 12 that homeless people who refuse to leave their encampments will face a fine or jail time. They will be offered mental health and addiction services. “These are preexisting laws that are already on the books,” she said. “They have not been enforced.” Tyler Durden Thu, 08/14/2025 - 21:45",

    "fullContent": "Buffett Buys $1.6BN In New UnitedHealth Stake, Sells More Apple, Liquidates T-Mobile Following mounting speculation in recent months that Warren Buffett was quietly buying a stake in distressed health insurer UnitedHealth, earlier today his Berkshire Hathaway published its latest 13F filing, confirming that it had done just that during the second quarter after the stock cratered in late April amid regulatory concerns. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate acquired just over 5 million shares in UnitedHealth, a stake which was worth $1.6 billion as of June 30 making it Berkshire's 19th largest holding. At the same time, Berkshire also liquidated its entire $1 billion stake in T-Mobile during the period. The investment in the health insurer follows multiple crises for UnitedHealth, including the shocking assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan in an execution-style murder by rabid leftist Luigi Mangione. UnitedHealth has also faced unexpected increases in medical costs. In April, it reported earnings below Wall Street estimates for the first time in more than a decade, and slashed guidance, sending the stock price plummeting. It has since replaced its CEO and announced plans to replace its chief financial officer. The disclosure of Buffett's UNH stake sent the insurer’s shares up more than 10% in after hours trading. There were several other notable changes in Berkshire's portfolio, which amounted to $258 billion as of June 30. After a three quarter pause, Buffett resumed selling his Apple stake, offloading another 20 million shares during the period, after slashing his holding of the iPhone maker by more than half last year. Yet even at 280 million shares, Berkshire’s Apple stake remains its largest equity stake by market value, despite it falling by about $9.2 billion in the three months ended June 30. Berkshire also continued trimming holdings in Bank of America, selling 21 million shares and bringing its stake down to about 8% at the end of June. Buffett started whittling down the bank investment last year, without providing any explanation for the move. Curiously, Buffett remains in largely degrossing mode, and reduced his holdings in 4 of his top 5 positions (AAPL, BAC, KO and CVX), only keeping his American Express stake unchanged. Other names that saw a reduction were Davita, Liberty Media, Capital One. Buffett also added to some of his holdings: he modestly boosted his stake in Constellation Brands and Dominos, and more than doubled his position in Pool Corp. One of Berkshire's equity bets, a stake in consumer foods giant Kraft Heinz, has been a headache for Buffett’s company. The conglomerate took a $3.8 billion impairment charge on its investment earlier this year, and kept its holding unchanged in the second quarter. Finally, while liquidating his entire $1 billion stake in TMobile, Buffett also added new positions in Nucor, DR Hodton, Lamar Advertising And Allegion. As Bloomberg notes, Berkshire boosted its investment in US homebuilders in what appears to be a bet on lower rates in the future, building its stake in Lennar and buying 1.5 million shares of D.R. Horton. The company also bought more shares of steel manufacturer Nucor Corp. Those changes were omitted in a previous filing as the company requested confidentiality. The full breakdown is below.

    "summary": "Mamdani's Biggest Threat To Democrats Authored by J.T. Young via RealClearPolitics, For the last 10 years, it’s been difficult for Democrats to win elections unless the campaigns center on Donald Trump.",
    "fullContent": "Mamdani's Biggest Threat To Democrats Authored by J.T. Young via RealClearPolitics, For the last 10 years, it’s been difficult for Democrats to win elections unless the campaigns center on Donald Trump. But the arrival of Zohran Mamdani on the national stage risks carrying the Democratic Party far off message – and derailing its strategy for 2026 and beyond. With his upset win in the Democratic primary, Democratic-Socialist Mamdani has the inside track in New York City’s mayoral race. New York already has a host of problems: crime, illegal immigration, high spending, high taxes, and a declining population and dwindling tax base. Mamdani’s radical policy proposals only threaten to add to these woes. Free bus service, government-run grocery stores, and government-built housing all promise to increase New York City’s already high spending. Mamdani’s commitment to increase taxes on higher income and whiter neighborhoods will increase New York City’s already high taxes. Together, the two will squeeze the city’s economy, pushing out more of the city’s population and further eroding its tax base. Mamdani’s earlier support for defunding the police and not cooperating with ICE will hike crime and illegal immigration. In sum, Mamdani threatens to accelerate the negative economic and societal spiral New York City has been experiencing for some time. It is the last thing New Yorkers need. Accentuating America’s perception of Democrat excesses in the nation’s biggest city is also the last thing Democrats need. How big a problem is this for Democrats? Such topics were among President Biden’s worst polling performances: According to Real Clear Politics’ final average of Biden’s job approval polling, Americans gave him just a 38.8% approval on his handling of the economy, 38% on crime, and 33.5% on immigration. What’s more, Mamdani, and other big-city mayors and mayoral candidates espousing radical policies, could eclipse the Democrats’ national campaign strategy of running against Trump as well. Over the last decade, Democrats’ only national election successes have come when Trump is the election’s focus. In 2018, with Trump in office, they won control of the House of Representatives. In 2020 with Trump as the incumbent, Democrats won the presidency and the Senate. Conversely in 2016, Democrats could not escape Hillary Clinton being their standard-bearer. As a result, they lost the White House in a profound political upset. In 2022, with Joe Biden in office, Democrats lost the House. In 2024, Biden and Harris were both incumbents; with reelections being referendums on incumbents, the focus was again on Democrats, and they lost the presidency. Having learned these lessons, Democrats aim to make Trump the focus in 2026 and 2028 – even without Trump on the ballot. Despite a string of policy successes, Trump remains a divisive political figure. According to RCP’s recent average of national polling, Trump’s job approval rating is just 45.9% and his favorability rating only 44.5%. Without Trump on the 2026 and 2028 ballots, Republicans must defend his divisive legacy without having the benefit of his vote-getting ability. More than a strategy, this is a necessity for Democrats. Trump is the only thing that unites them as a party. Democrats lack their own winning policies; their most prominent stands against Trump have been issues – illegal immigration, transgender rights, and crime – that cost them in November 2024. The result is that Democrats find themselves with an abysmal standing: A recent WSJ poll found only 33% of Americans had a favorable view of the Democratic Party. If elected mayor of America’s largest city, Mamdani undermines this approach. Republicans would love nothing better than to run against New York, the same way they ran against California when Kamala Harris became Democrats’ presidential nominee. Republicans proved last year that they can win the presidency handily without winning either coast. In 2024, Republicans lost New York, California, Washington, and Massachusetts by an average of 58% of the popular vote. Yet, Democrats won only 121 of the remaining 433 electoral votes – just 28%. Republicans won 72% of the electoral votes outside Democrats’ coastal strongholds. Only needing 270 total electoral votes for victory, Trump’s 312 votes give Republicans a virtual stranglehold on America’s “flyover” country – where 80% of America’s total electoral votes lie. In contrast, Democrats have no chance without New York and California; so, they are stuck with sticking up for both. If Mamdani succeeds in rotting the Big Apple, Democrats could see 2026 and 2028 potentially going from a best-case scenario to a worst-case scenario. Democrats would find themselves either defending Mamdani’s radical policies and alienating America or rejecting Mamdani’s radicalism and alienating their far-left supporters.
