So let’s take a look at two of my favorite labor indicators: real average hourly wages and real aggregate payrolls for nonsupervisory workers.First, here are real average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers:These were unchanged in June. Nominally wages increased 0.3% in June, but so did consumer inflation, so the net was zero. The upward trend in these since July 2022 (when gas prices backed off from $5/gallon due to the Ukraine war) remains intact.Here is the long term YoY% look:Real hourly wages have increased. 1.2% in the 12 months. With a few exceptions, for the past two years they have increased between 1.0% and 1.7% YoY. More importantly, with the exception of the 2001 and COVID recessions, real hourly wages have always been negative YoY by the onset of the downturn.

In an advisory about the SharePoint security hole, a.k.a. CVE-2025-53770, Microsoft said it is aware of active attacks targeting on-premises SharePoint Server customers and exploiting vulnerabilities that were only partially addressed by the July 8, 2025 security update. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) concurred, saying CVE-2025-53770 is a variant on a flaw Microsoft patched earlier this month (CVE-2025-49706). Microsoft notes the weakness applies only to SharePoint Servers that organizations use in-house, and that SharePoint Online and Microsoft 365 are not affected. The Washington Pos",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20476",
    "summary": "Based on an estimated two-region dynamic general equilibrium model, we show that the persistent productivity growth differential between the Euro Area (EA) and rest of the world (RoW) has been a key driver of the EA trade surplus since the launch of the Euro. A secular decline in the EA’s spending home bias and a trend decrease in relative EA import prices account for the stability of the EA real exchange rate, despite slower EA output growth. By incorporating trend shocks to growth and trade, the analysis departs from much of the open-economy macroeconomics literature which has focused on stationary disturbances. Our results highlight the relevance of non-stationary shocks for the analysis of external adjustment.",

    "summary": "This paper examines the relationship between green innovation and the business cycle, revealing that while non-green innovation is procyclical, green innovation is countercyclical. This pattern holds unconditionally over the business cycle and conditional on economic shocks. Motivated by these findings, we develop a business cycle model with endogenous green and non-green innovation to explain their distinct cyclical behavior. The key mechanism operates through a ‘green is in the future’ channel: green patents are expected to generate higher profits in the future, making green patenting less sensitive to short-term economic fluctuations. In general equilibrium, this channel is reinforced, making green and non-green innovation effective substitutes. We provide direct evidence supporting the model mechanism using data on market-implied values of green and non-green patents.",
