It was one of the largest deals in the oil and gas space in recent history, after Exxon’s takeover of Pioneer Natural Resources, finalized in 2024. With that out of the way, the question begs to be asked: could the two U.S. giants strike a deal to create a single, much bigger giant? Some argue it might only be a matter of time.

    "summary": "Digital hiring tools challenge older workers accustomed to traditional job search methods. Using a large-scale RCT, we evaluate a job search training program for high-skilled older unemployed individuals focused on the use of online platforms and social networks. The program increased earnings and job stability for men, especially in jobs requiring complex matching, suggesting improved match quality, but had no positive impact on women's earnings and reduced their employment. Gender differences cannot be explained by observable characteristics or differential compliance but appear to derive from treated women's increased reservation wages and lower returns to online search tools.",
