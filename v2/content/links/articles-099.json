Tarriela released the footage on X. He described what unfolded: Here is a longer video capturing the collision between the PLA Navy 164 and the China Coast Guard 3104. The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has consistently urged the Chinese government to respect the COLREGS and to approach these matters with professionalism, especially considering their role in enforcing maritime laws. We have also emphasized that such reckless behavior at sea could ultimately lead to accidents. Our thoughts are with the CCG personnel who may have been injured in this incident.

    "fullContent": "RussiaGate: 'A Murder Of American Democracy Was Committed' Authored by James Howard Kunstler, Under Color Of Law \"The second-order and third-order damages of RussiaGate are incalculable. A murder of American democracy was committed.\" - Mike Benz on \"X\" Surely you’ve noticed the ominous cone of silence around the DOJ and the FBI as rumors of “accountability” mount against well-known figures who used government to make war against its own citizens. That is exactly what happened, by the way, in case you’re baffled by the news. The agencies aren’t leaking this time, especially not to the mendacious scribes that infest The New York Times and The WashPo, who function as vanguard to the corps of traitors in the rogue fourth branch of government called the Blob. So, the silence begs you to ask: Are they doing anything in there? Yes, they are making cases. And they are not yapping idly about it in the news, legacy or alt. They are preparing evidence for grand juries that will decide if probable cause exists to indict those well-known figures — several of whom have become cable news performers, foolishly, if obliquely, advertising their own culpability for years now. You’ll just have to wait, though perhaps not for long. It is August, after all, the horse latitudes of the year when things go still. You are lectured incessantly and sanctimoniously by these same suspects about the rule of law (in “our democracy”). Many of these characters are maestros in the dark arts of lawfare, which, paradoxically, is the practice of using law to pervert and dishonor the rule of law. Lately, you are introduced to a similar sounding phrase, under color of law, with a related meaning. Understand it and you will see what has been behind virtually all the mischief in our public affairs this past, vicious decade. Under color of law has deep roots in Anglo-American jurisprudence because law, by its nature, lends itself to abuse and nefarious misuse. The law’s “nature” is that it is a set of rules to decide matters of consequence, both personal and public, where much is at stake: ownership of property, liberty, life itself. At times, actions are taken in the name of the law to unjustly deprive persons of life, liberty, and property, usually for the benefit of other persons. The phrase, life, liberty, and property, derives from John Locke’s Two Treatises on Government (1689), which argued that these are natural rights, God-given, and that it is government’s duty to protect these rights, government being the practical application of law. The phrase life, liberty, and property deeply influenced America’s founders. Thomas Jefferson changed it up a bit in the Declaration of Independence as “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” with a eudaimonian twist to inspire America to flourish on its own, off England’s leash. It was also Jefferson’s way of detaching the Declaration from the issue of slavery, where “property” could refer to human beings. But the Lockean original, life, liberty and property, reappears in the Bill of Rights to the Constitution. It is in the Fifth Amendment, protecting persons from the arbitrary deprivation of these rights without due process by the federal government, and in the Fourteenth Amendment applying the same principle of law to state governments. Where lawfare comes in is under due process. Lawfare’s aim is to pervert due process, to use officers of the courts to act unfairly and unjustly in the name of the law, and thus, under color of law. This is exactly what you saw in the several cases brought against Mr. Trump in New York State in 2024, a three-ring circus of process-abuse engineered by the “Joe Biden” White House, coordinated with Merrick Garland’s DOJ (through Deputy AG Lisa Monaco), with assists from NY AG Letitia James and Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. Ditto the RICO case attempted in Atlanta under Fulton County DA Fani Willis, a spectacular botch. And ditto, the cases brought under Special Counsel Jack Smith in Florida and DC, also badly botched. The slovenly ineptitude of these cases was really something to behold, including the sordid romantic complications around Fani Willis and her chosen chief prosecutor, “boyfriend” Nathan Wade, a divorce lawyer with no experience in criminal law. Throw in the disgraceful, self-conflicted antics of the Judges Kaplan, Engoron, and Merchan in the New York cases, and the oafish conduct of Jack Smith and his assistants in Florida and DC — and what you get is a demonstration of how crude an instrument sheer lying actually is in the practice of law, and how easily it breaks against the people using it. Some of these characters are just now coming to grief: Letitia James faces a DOJ action on depriving Mr. Trump’s rights, and SC Jack Smith is under active FBI investigation for evidence tampering and other crimes of process abuse. It would be fitting for all the prosecutors and the three judges in the New York cases to face similar inquiries. The phrase under color of law establishes liability for abuse of power for officials vested with the terrible authority for upending people’s lives. The phrase “deprivation of rights” appears explicitly in federal statutes primarily focused on holding government officials and others acting with apparent legal authority accountable for willfully violating an individual’s constitutional or legal rights. The most relevant statute is 18 U.S.C. § 242, which directly criminalizes such conduct. Additional statutes, such as 18 U.S.C. § 241, 18 U.S.C. § 250, 18 U.S.C. § 2243, and 18 U.S.C. § 2244. That’s where all this is going, even if all that’s coming out of the DOJ and FBI for the moment is that ominous silence. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 16:20",

While there is a bunch of stuff in the report (which pro subs can read at their leisure here), what was most notable is the \"discovery\" that it's not just Japanese car makers. As Goldman's Jan Hatzius reveals, \"we find that US import prices on tariffed goods have declined somewhat, suggesting that foreign exporters have absorbed some tariff costs by lowering their export prices to the US, unlike during the 2018-2019 trade war.\" Our updated analysis shows that a 1pp increase in the product-level tariff rate led to a 0.25% cumulative decline in import prices over the first three months of implementation, with minimal impact thereafter. Of course, here Goldman had to mix fact with projection to not sound like a bunch of wrong, confused career economists. When one strips away hypothesis and forecast, here is what actually happened: \"following the implementation of China and auto tariffs, import prices (exclusive of tariffs) of both consumer and non-consumer goods from China, as well as import prices of passenger cars (exclusive of tariffs) from the EU and Japan, all experienced sharp declines.\" Looking forward, Goldman concludes that whereas \"foreign exporters had absorbed 14% of the cost of all tariffs implemented so far through June, their share will rise to 25% if the more recent tariffs follow the same pattern as the earliest tariffs on China.\" This also means that the 9% increase in the effective tariff rate through June has reduced import prices by at least 1.3% so far, and that the total 14% increase in the effective tariff rate that Goldman expects in 2025 will likely reduce import prices by 3.7%, if not much more assuming foreign producers continue to keep prices reduced to remain competitive with lower-cost domestic producers. The rest of the Goldman note goes on to do what Morgan Stanley tried to do yesterday: forecast just when all those tariffs will eventually finally show up in inflation... an exercise they have to do because both giant banks were very wrong in incorrectly assuming that inflation would already be far higher than it is so far. Don't be surprise if tomorrow's CPI comes in tame yet again, prompting even more revisions to Goldman's inflation ETA. Much more in the full Goldman note, available to pro subscribers.

    "fullContent": "\"Prepare Now\": Substation Failure Puts Baltimore At Risk Of \"Widespread\" Blackout Over a million residents across central Maryland, particularly in the Baltimore metro, were warned moments ago by the local utility that a substation failure linked to a major power plant could trigger widespread blackouts this afternoon. The alert comes barely a week after President Trump handed Maryland Governor Wes Moore and the Democratic Party in Annapolis a political lifeline to prevent power blackouts, underscoring the fragility of the state's power grid under the weight of failed Democrat-driven green energy policies. It's an unbelievable disgrace what the Democrats have done to the people of this state. https://t.co/ogqeCHafQQ — Robin Grammer (@RobinGrammer) August 11, 2025 Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) has asked all 1.3 million of its electric customers in central Maryland \"to conserve electricity to reduce the potential for widespread outages this afternoon and evening, due to a power plant experiencing an unplanned disconnection from the BGE electric system.\" BGE is asking all customers to conserve electricity to reduce the potential for widespread outages this afternoon and evening as the result of a power plant experiencing an unplanned disconnection from the BGE electric system. — BGE (@MyBGE) August 11, 2025 The Maryland Freedom Caucus reports that a substation linked to the Brandon Shores Power Plant experienced a failure earlier today, which could leave the supply insufficient when demand peaks later. As a result, Baltimore City and surrounding areas may face rolling blackouts this afternoon. The Maryland Freedom Caucus blamed what it called \"irresponsible Democrats\" and their \"failed green energy policies\" for the crisis. The Maryland Freedom Caucus urges residents in affected areas to take precautions to limit the impact of any outages. But make no mistake—this crisis is the direct result of radical, extremist energy policies from Maryland Democrats and Governor Wes Moore, which are driving reliable power plants toward closure and leaving our grid on the brink. This situation has the real possibility of being a regular occurrence if we do not change course. We renew our call to Governor Moore to stop relying on federal bailouts and use his executive authority to protect Maryland's energy future: Keep our existing plants open and reopen recently closed facilities End the Green Energy Scam mandates strangling our economy Eliminate the EmPOWER surcharge that drains ratepayers without cooling their homes Immediately add nuclear to Maryland's Tier 1 energy options. A short time ago, we were alerted to a substation failure that feeds the Brandon Shores Power Plant that may result in brief blackouts in the Baltimore region. We are urging impacted residents to prepare now but also those who can be held accountable to step up and do the right… pic.twitter.com/vQjqutPNhl — Maryland Freedom Caucus (@MDFreedomCaucus) August 11, 2025 Last week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright granted Democrats in the state a massive political lifeline to prevent rolling blackouts by granting a 90-day emergency waiver allowing the H.A. Wagner power plant to exceed pollution limits to avoid rolling blackouts in the Baltimore metro area. We no longer need to explain how Maryland is becoming the epicenter of the Democratic Party's imploding policies - all on display for the nation to see, especially on the green issue. \"Another Reason To Leave\": Top Maryland Power Official Warns Of Regular Rolling Blackouts Maryland Democrats Scramble As Green Energy Agenda Sparks Power Bill Hyperinflation Democrats Spark \"Manufactured Power Crisis\" In Maryland As Left Begins To Panic \"You're Welcome\": Pennsylvania Boasts About Saving 'Green' Maryland From Near Power Grid Collapse Far-Left Panic: Dark Money NGO Floods Baltimore Airwaves With Propaganda To Save Governor Trump Admin Throws Maryland Democrats A Lifeline To Halt Power Blackout Threat After Green Policies Backfire Meanwhile, failed green policies and increasing baseload power demand, driven by data centers, EVs, and other electrification trends, have created a perfect storm of hyperinflated power bills for residents.

    "fullContent": "Massachusetts Teachers Demand New Wealth Tax Authored by Jonathan Turley, I have long opposed wealth taxes based on both constitutional and practical grounds. When Elizabeth Warren pushed her own wealth tax, I noted that the high starting income or wealth levels would likely be lowered with time if Congress were ever allowed to cross this constitutional Rubicon. The Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA) is now demanding an amendment to the state constitution to tax the “wealth of the richest 1%” to pay for free public college. Previously, the state passed a constitutional amendment to place a 4 % tax on income above $1 million. This would add a new wealth tax to that earlier “Fair Share Amendment.” In a press release, the teachers union president Max Page declared: “if we are serious about social and economic justice and nurturing a culturally rich and welcoming state of involved citizens, we will provide all residents with the best vehicle for a prosperous future – public education.” New York City socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has made a similar proposal that, in addition to taxing corporations, he will “tax the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers—those earning above $1 million annually—a flat 2% tax.” Not surprisingly, Warren recently declared Mamdani the future of the Democratic Party. Massachusetts is already in the top ten highest tax jurisdictions. These tax increases are why many of us have opposed the state and local (SALT) tax deduction. As high-tax states continue to increase their rates, they expect residents in low tax states to subsidize them. My forthcoming book, Rage and the Republic: The Unfinished Story of the American Revolution, discusses the wealth tax controversy and how these moves are likely to increase in the coming years.

    "fullContent": "Israeli Strike Kills 5 Al Jazeera Journalists In Gaza, IDF Says They Were Part Of Hamas Cell Israel's military (IDF) has stepped up its bombing of Gaza City, and already there are mounting civilian casualties and an international outcry, especially after a well-known regional reporter and his crew were killed in a weekend strike Five journalists and staff members working for Al Jazeera were among seven total people killed in a late Sunday night strike. They were sheltered in a press-marked tent near Al-Shifa hospital, various sources indicate. The Hamas-run Government Media Office in Gaza has condemned the attack on the press group as \"deliberate and premeditated\". It's identified prominent Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif as among the dead. The 28-year-old Al Jazeera Arabic journalist was known to have reported extensively from northern Gaza, and recently Israel identified him as among six 'compromised' journalists from Al Jazeera who have alleged ties with Hamas. The network has said Israel is falsely seeking to justify its war crimes against journalists. Anas al-Sharif. Source: Al Jazeera Also among the dead weere Mohammed Qraiqeh and three photographers: Ibrahim Zaher, Moamen Aliwa and Mohammed Noufal. However, Israel is claiming these were military targets and not journalists. The NY Times writes, \"The Israeli military confirmed that it had conducted a strike targeting one of the men killed, whom it accused of being a Hamas fighter posing as a reporter, an allegation that he and the network had rejected.\" The United Nations is not accepting Israel's defense of its actions, instead calling the attack a \"serious violation of international humanitarian law.\" The UN issued a statement on X saying, \"We condemn the Israeli military’s killing of six Palestinian journalists by targeting their tent — a grave breach of international humanitarian law,” and emphasized that “Israel must uphold its obligation to protect all civilians, including journalists.\" The UN further said at least 242 Palestinian journalists have died in Gaza since October 7, 2023, and is urging greater security and protection for journalists in the midst of the conflict. \"Israel must respect and protect all civilians, including journalists,\" it said. Funerals for the men are already underway on Monday. As for Anas Al-Sharif, the IDF alleges he was leading a Hamas cell. The Qatar-based Al Jazeera network is pushing back: Meron Rapoport, a veteran Israeli journalist and editor of the Local Call news site, has said the Israeli military’s accusation that Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif was a Hamas member “doesn’t make sense at all”. “The Israeli explanations are, at best, very lacking,” Rapoport told Al Jazeera from Tel Aviv. He said that if the claims were true, Israel would have been expected to have targeted or arrested al-Sharif a long time ago. He said Israel likely targeted al-Sharif now because of two main factors – first, his important role in “telling the world that there is famine in Gaza”, which “really hurt Israel internationally”; and, second, because of the planned upcoming invasion of Gaza City, which Israel wants to minimise coverage of. Al Jazeera offices in Israel and the West Bank have already long ago been raided and shut down by Israeli security forces. Israeli leaders have long conisdered the Mideast regional channel to be adversarial. Journalist Anas al-Sharif along with four other Al Jazeera staff have been killed by an Israeli attack which targeted a tent for the press outside al-Shifa Hospital’s main gate. pic.twitter.com/hfwWdDCCji — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) August 11, 2025 It was only in July that Al Jazeera warned that Israel threatened to directly target its correspondent Al-Sharif: Al Jazeera Media Network has denounced the Israeli military for what it called a “campaign of incitement” against its reporters in the Gaza Strip, including most notably Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Anas al-Sharif. In a statement on Friday, Al Jazeera said it “strongly condemns and denounces these relentless efforts, which have consistently incited against its staff since the beginning of its coverage of the ongoing Israeli war on Gaza”. In May of 2022, the IDF shot dead an even more well-known Al Jazeera journalist. Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian Christian, was killed while covering the siege of Jenin refugee camp. She had been wearing a press vest at the time and was huddled with other journalists at the moment she was shot. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 15:05",
