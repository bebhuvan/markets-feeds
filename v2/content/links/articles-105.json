    "fullContent": "Israel To Take Control Of All Of Gaza, But Netanyahu Claims Not Forever There have been reports all week which have said that Israel is now intent on conquering and occupying the whole of the Gaza Strip, and when asked about it Tuesday Presdient Trump responded, \"It is going to be pretty much up to Israel.\" In a fresh Thursday report, Axios writes that Trump \"does not oppose Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to launch a new military operation to occupy the entire Gaza Strip, U.S. and Israeli officials say.\" There's been some nuance in Netanyahu's position, however, as he's sought to distance himself from claims that he's planning a permanent occupation by Israeli forces. Source: Israeli army via Reuters \"We intend to,\" Netanyahu affirmed to Fox News when asked if he aims to take over the whole the strip. But then he said it would eventually be given over to a responsibly governing entitiy. \"We don’t want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We don’t want to govern it. We don’t want to be there as a governing body,\" he said. Also, Netanyahu's office has told Axios, \"We are not willing to remain in the current limbo and we are not willing to surrender to Hamas' demands — so essentially only one option is left, to take a drastic step. This is the last card we have left.\" Critics and skeptics have said Israel has long been deceptive at many points about its war aims. The whole counter-Hamas operation was launched with limited goals initially articulated, centered on taking out Hamas leadership and gaining the liberation of all captives - but the scope of operations have clearly shifted and been extended. Military leadership has taken a more cautious approach, warning that efforts to permanently control Gaza would be falling into a \"trap\" - as we reported earlier. Kan News public broadcaster previously stated \"The prime minister's direction is to go and conquer the Gaza Strip.\" The Israeli military's (IDF) chief of staff, Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir, has argued in a closed-door cabinet meeting that this \"will significantly endanger their lives and cause the army to burn out.\" Aerial view showing utter destruction of the Gaza Strip... The past year has seen Netanyahu clarify to political allies and opponets alike that he's opting for a military solution. Criticis have said he's putting the remaining hostages in danger. As for what group might one day take over, it is entirely doubtul that any Palestinian body - such as the Palestinian Authority - will actually be allowed to step in and govern by Israel. This is indeed a recipe for permanent occupation and annexation. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 15:05",

    "fullContent": "Trump Admin Throws Maryland Democrats A Lifeline To Halt Power Blackout Threat After Green Policies Backfire Maryland Governor Wes Moore and the Democratic Party in Annapolis have managed to spark a 'manufactured power crisis' in the Mid-Atlantic state through failed green energy policies, which have driven power bill costs up more than 1,000% over several years and are now financially crushing working-class households and mom and pop businesses. The Democrats' promise of a progressive 'utopia' in the imploding state has failed to materialize - and frankly, never will. Now, the Trump administration is throwing Governor Moore and the far-left Democrats, who are running the state into the ground, a massive lifeline to prevent a power grid collapse in the Baltimore region. According to Fox Baltimore reporter Gary Collins, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has granted a 90-day emergency waiver allowing the H.A. Wagner power plant to exceed pollution limits to avoid rolling blackouts in the Baltimore metro area. Traditionally coal-fired, but also capable of burning oil and natural gas, the Wagner power plant is owned and operated by Talon Energy and is located near Curtis Bay, Maryland. It provides hundreds of megawatts, playing a key role in supplying on-demand baseload power to Baltimore Gas & Electric (BG&E) Zone, part of the PJM Interconnection grid (Goldman spotted this power crisis from a mile away). Democrats who run the state have placed strict pollution controls on the Wagner power due to its coal usage, often reaching emissions caps during peak demand hours. Trump's lifeline for Democrats will help prevent rolling blackouts - like a third-world country - that would ultimately spark more doom for Gov. Moore's 2028 presidential ticket - if he ever had one. But apparently he does, because the Democratic Party has fired up its NGO complex and has been buying air time on local radio stations - and one state lawmaker told us the propaganda has shifted to purchasing social media influencers, all to quell growing dissent as the power bill crisis crushes everyone. We no longer need to explain how Maryland is becoming the epicenter of the Democratic Party's imploding policies - all on display for the nation to see, especially on the green issue. \"Another Reason To Leave\": Top Maryland Power Official Warns Of Regular Rolling Blackouts Maryland Democrats Scramble As Green Energy Agenda Sparks Power Bill Hyperinflation Democrats Spark \"Manufactured Power Crisis\" In Maryland As Left Begins To Panic \"You're Welcome\": Pennsylvania Boasts About Saving 'Green' Maryland From Near Power Grid Collapse Far-Left Panic: Dark Money NGO Floods Baltimore Airwaves With Propaganda To Save Governor Maryland must undergo an urgent course correction on its power grid policies or face a harsh winter of darkness.

Photo released by Netanyahu’s office. AIPAC Tracker, a group that tracks donations to US lawmakers from pro-Israel lobby groups, identified 20 House GOP members from a picture posted online by Netanyahu’s office. US House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) is also in Israel this week and visited illegal Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including one where he dined with Netanyahu. According to Punchbowl News, about 20 House Democrats are also headed to Israel during the recess on an AIPAC-sponsored trip. The strong show of support for Israel from so many US lawmakers comes as Israel is regularly massacring over 100 Palestinians a day in Gaza, including many desperate people seeking aid, and Palestinians are starving to death in Gaza every day due to the US-backed Israeli blockade.

Johnson is leading a smaller delegation that includes Reps. Michael McCaul (R-TX), Nathaniel Moran (R-TX), Michael Cloud (R-TX), and Claudia Tenney (R-NY). Members of the US Congress travel to Israel more than any other country by a huge distance. In fact, they take \"more trips to Israel than to the entire Western Hemisphere and the continent of Africa combined.\" —journalist Glenn Greenwald According to Punchbowl, the Democrat delegation will be led by House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (CA) and Rep. Steny Hoyer (MD). Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders is also visiting Israel and joined Johnson in his visit to West Bank settlements. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 14:05",

For those who may not be in the seat, or have a clue as to just what the daily roller-coaster has been like for the last seven months and counting, Harris Kupperman, CIO of Praetorian Capital posted the following on X, which although a little tongue in cheek, is awfully close to the reality of anyone trying to trade this chaos. Brace yourself, as Kuppy says \"Every fuckin' day bro... every one!\": 6:00 - Wake up, check what Trump tariffed overnight. Cambodia up +200%, Paraguay -3% (they said thanks). 6:05 - Brew some coffee. 6:10 - Trump tweets that the laws are rigged, since he cannot tariff Arizona. Mentally scroll the portfolio for exposure… 6:15 - Check what happened in Asia and Europe. 6:22 - Trump announces that hot dogs will join the food pyramid. Bans hot dog exports. Fortunately our book dodged that one. 6:30 - Drink some coffee, talk to wife, pray Trump will spend the morning golfing so I can do some actual work... 6:31 - Trump announces that oil at $65 is too high. Threatens anyone who isn’t producing more oil. 6:32 - Top 5 position announces earnings, want to join the earnings call at 7am, but Trump just scheduled a press conference then, and he’s looking unpredictable. 7:02 - Trump announces that Japan can now export golf balls tariff-free, in honor of Abe letting him cheat at golf. Join the earnings call instead. 7:06 - Futures plunge 65 handles in a single tick, frantically leave the earnings call and go back to whatever Trump is still yapping about in his press conference. 7:10 - Scroll through premarket quotes. NVDA and PLTR are both up 5% b/c it’s a day ending in ‘Y’ but SPZ are now down 80 handles. 7:15 - Trump changed his mind and SPZ are now up 25 handles as everyone rushes to cover their short. (I re-join the earnings call) 7:30 - Some broker I’ve never heard of just downgraded a top 5 position and it’s down 15% on 300 shares traded. I’m pretty confident it will close around there too. (I crack open a beer as I skim his downgrade report, realizing that nothing productive will happen today…) 8:00 - An LP calls to remind me of some ShitCoin he recommended that’s now up 1800% since he recommended it. 8:09 - 10-yr bonds gap down 17 bps, but all I can find is a tweet from Bessent about how great Main Street is doing. 8:15 - Some sell side asshole cold-calls me to see if I want a copy of his upgrade report on the AI sector. Tells me that “it’s going to be big and you don’t want to miss it.” 8:20 - Check my email, do 10 minutes of actual work. 8:30 - Trump threatens Brazil, I realize our BZ exposure is gonna get thumped on the open. (Crack open a 2nd beer) 8:33 - Reminisce about how productive I was, since Biden wouldn’t even wake up until noon. 8:40 - Chat with my CFO for 19 mins about some new compliance form we need to file. 8:59 - Trump Tweets about how stupid Powell is. Futures are back down 30 handles. 9:04 - Join a call 4 mins late with an endowment that wants an update, but 100% will never invest. “BTW - we need you to update the DDQ as we’ve changed our format” 9:29 - Casino is opening. Let’s see what happens. 9:32 - I’m bored. Go back to reading emails. Turns out the govt created another new form we ALSO need to fill out… 10:00 - We’re actually up 50bps. 10:03 - Now down 175bps. Trump just threatened to bomb Europe. 10:06 - Tweets he was just joking about Europe. But those guys need to get their shit together bc he might still bomb them. 10:08 - Ready for bourbon. Beer won’t cut it… 10:30 - EIA oil inventory shows yet another massive draw. Oil drops 5% anyway. 10:40 - Don Jr’s latest SPAC rallies 300% on rumors it may launch a new ShitCoin 10:45 - Friend calls to cry about how cheap all his names are. We both agree we were idiots to invest in businesses with earnings. 11:22 - Trump reminds everyone about how much Putin likes him. 11:40 - Realize I’m now too tweaked to sit in the office. Turn off the machines and go get lunch with a friend who’s also gonna bitch about how stupid markets have become. 12:05 - Hostess at restaurant pitches me some ShitCoin. Claims she’s up a few million on it 12:07 - Friend starts bitching about how stupid it is to be an investor under Trump, and how we all made money under Biden. I agree with him, but we both agree it would be even stupider under Kamala… For more from Harris, visit Kuppy’s Korner blog at http://pracap.com Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 13:45",

    "fullContent": "Yields Spike After Very Ugly, Tailing 30Y Auction Sparks Steepening Fears After two decidedly ugly auctions, including a poor 3Y on Tuesday and a very poor 10Y yesterday, moments ago the Treasury concluded the week's trio of refunding auctions when it sold $25BN in 30Y paper. And this particular auction may have been the worst of the lot. The final refunding auction priced at a high yield of 4.813%, which while lower than July's 4.889% was not low enough, and with the When Issued at 4.792%, the auction tailed the When Issued by 2.1bps, the biggest tail since last August. The bid to cover was just as ugly: dropping to 2.266% (from 2.383) it was the lowest since November 2023 (and obviously far below the six auction average). The internals were not quite so fire, although here too the picture was bad: Indirects dropped again, sliding from 59.8% in July to 59.5%, the lowest since May - which was a major outlier - and the second lowest going back all the way to 2021. And with Directs awarded 23.03%, down modestly from 27.40% last month and below the six-auction average of 24.2%, Dealers were left holding a whopping 17.46%, the highest August 2024 when they were left holding 19.18%. Bottom line: the last coupon auction of the week was also the ugliest, and the bond market saw right through it, sending 10% yields surging to session highs, just around 4.25%. What is more ominous, is that today's auction is a harbinger of what will happen when Powell finally does cut, and the market immediately reprices inflation expectations, sending long end yields exploding higher in a steepening move that will make your nose bleed.
