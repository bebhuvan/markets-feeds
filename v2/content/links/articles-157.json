The breaches have been linked to a prolific but loosely-affiliated cybercrime group dubbed “Scattered Spider,” whose other recent victims include multiple airlines. The U.K.’s National Crime Agency (NCA) declined verify the names of those arrested, saying only that they included two males aged 19, another aged 17, and 20-year-old female. Scattered Spider is the name given to an English-speaking cybercrime group known for using social engineering tactics to break into companies and steal data for ransom, often impersonating employees or contractors to deceive IT help desks into granting access. The FBI warned last month that Scattered Spider had recently shifted to targeting companies in the retail and airline sectors. KrebsOnSecurity has learned the identiti",

Italy’s northernmost province lies on the Alps’ south side and is one of Europe’s most popular holiday destinations. The majestic mountain world of the Dolomites, lush meadows of Europe’s highest mountain pasture, mellow lakeside vineyards, the region’s lively capital Bozen with its Italian flair, or the chic resort town of Merano – it is first and foremost the landscapes that make Alto Adige so attractive. In spring one is amazed by the blossoming apple trees, in summer the region turns into a hiking paradise, in autumn it lures with the rich harvest of wine grapes and chestnuts, and in winter it’s a dream destination for skiers and lovers of fairytale-like snowy l",
