    "fullContent": "How Coca-Cola's Secret Formula Has Changed Over Time Coca-Cola debuted in 1886 as a pharmacy fountain drink. Its original syrup drew on coca leaves and kola nuts for stimulation and flavor. Over time, the recipe changed alongside regulations, technology, and tastes. In the following chart, Visual Capitalist's Bruno Venditti pairs a quick dataset with context on how ingredients and nutrition have evolved. The ingredient and nutrition snapshot for today’s U.S. Coca-Cola comes from Coca-Cola. From Coca to “Decocainized” Coca Early formulas included coca leaf extract, and small amounts of cocaine remained until the early 1900s. By 1903, the drug was removed amid changing laws and public health concerns. Coca-leaf flavoring persisted in “decocainized” form, prepared under license in the U.S. by a facility now operated by Stepan Company. These shifts preserved the brand’s flavor profile while complying with evolving regulation. The Big Sweetener Switch In the U.S., Coca-Cola transitioned from cane sugar to high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) during the 1980s, with reporting in 1984 noting the move across major soda brands. Cost and supply dynamics favored corn syrup at the time. Not every market followed: in the U.K., for instance, Coca-Cola Original lists “sugar” rather than HFCS. This split explains why “Mexican Coke” tastes different to some consumers. “I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using real cane sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so… It’s just better!” - Donald Trump U.S. Coke has six standard ingredients: carbonated water, HFCS, caramel color, phosphoric acid, natural flavors, and caffeine. A 20 fl oz (591 mL) bottle has ~240 calories, ~65 g added sugar, and ~75 mg sodium, though labels can vary. Because the 1886 recipe is proprietary and not publicly released, a direct comparison isn’t possible. Following Trump’s push, Coca-Cola has announced it will launch a new product sweetened with U.S.-produced cane sugar next fall.
