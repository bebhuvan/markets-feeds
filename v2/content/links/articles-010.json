    "fullContent": "British People Have Had Enough... Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, In a striking display of public discontent, close to 750,000 people at time of writing have signed an official parliamentary petition demanding an immediate general election in the UK. Titled ‚ÄúCall an immediate general election,‚Äù the petition argues that the public seeks urgent change from the current Labour government, which won power just over a year ago in July 2024. Under UK rules, any petition surpassing 100,000 signatures triggers consideration for a parliamentary debate, a threshold this one has far exceeded‚Äîit has also prompted a government response, with a debate now pending. https://t.co/rVGSJaMjHL ‚Äî Peter Lloyd (@Suffragent_) August 13, 2025 The petition reflects mounting frustration with Prime Minister Keir Starmer‚Äôs leadership, Public dissatisfaction with Starmer stems from a range of issues, including perceived broken promises, economic struggles, and controversial welfare reforms that have sparked backlash over cuts and austerity measures. The Bank of England (BoE) has cut interest rates to 4%, the fifth cut in a year, as the UK economy struggles amid high inflation and a stagnant jobs market. The monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority of 5‚Äì4 to reduce the Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Finance Spot (@financespotnews) August 7, 2025 The economy is stagnant with no growth and rising costs. The UK is cutting rates because the economy is falling apart not because it‚Äôs healthy. üü• Stagnant growth üü• Collapsing housing market üü• Business investment vanishing üü• Political instability ‚Äî Wealth Mindset (@MWealth101) August 7, 2025 The Conservative government laid the groundwork, but the Labour government has exacerbated the woes. The Bank of England now admits that Rachel Reeves‚Äô anti-growth budget has caused the economy to stagnate. Interest rates will stay higher for longer, with ‚Äòheightened uncertainty‚Äô, higher prices, & higher costs. Working people foot the bill for Labour incompetence. ü•Ä‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/dYWrljp4W3 ‚Äî Anthony Boutall (@anthonyboutall) December 20, 2024 Another key flashpoint is mass migration. This week it was revealed that the UK has seen nearly 50,000 migrants cross the English Channel in small boats since Starmer became Prime Minister on July 5, 2024. üî∫ Number of small boat crossings since Starmer became Prime Minister expected to hit 50,000 on Tuesday. Read the full story ‚¨áÔ∏èhttps://t.co/M0c1zbkbB2 pic.twitter.com/yY1TYJWf3v ‚Äî The Telegraph (@Telegraph) August 12, 2025 This figure, reached in just 401 days, marks a significantly faster rate of crossings compared to Starmer‚Äôs predecessors, with Rishi Sunak taking 603 days and Boris Johnson 1,066 days to hit the same threshold. The numbers of crossings are up by almost 50 percent on last year. 'Just this morning we've had 220 that have arrived in Dover, with three small boats currently out in the Channel with at least 150 people heading towards the UK.' GB News' Mark White reacts to the 'sobering' migrant figures as numbers hit 50,000 so far this year. pic.twitter.com/e5EuRqBFzz ‚Äî GB News (@GBNEWS) August 12, 2025 The surge has fueled criticism of Labour‚Äôs immigration policies, particularly Starmer‚Äôs pledge to ‚Äúsmash the gangs‚Äù behind the crossings, which critics argue has failed to deter the unprecedented influx. Opponents argue this has strained public services, housing, and infrastructure, fueling perceptions that Starmer has normalized high immigration levels without adequate controls. Another flashpoint is spiralling crime. As a backdrop to this, freedom of speech is under attack, with many who have expressed their discontent finding themselves targets. Draconian new laws, introduced on the prext of ‚Äòprotecting‚Äô children, have immediately been used to stifle free expression. Starmer‚Äôs personal popularity has plummeted to record lows, with his net approval rating dipping to -41% in recent surveys, while Labour‚Äôs government approval has sunk to -55%, the lowest ever recorded for the party. Fresh blow to Starmer as Labour's approval rating slumps to its lowest EVER level ‚Äì with just 13 per cent happy with government's record https://t.co/F7KgLTljYM ‚Äî Daily Mail (@DailyMail) August 12, 2025 Only 23% of Britons view him favourably, a sharp decline from post-election highs, amid accusations of losing authority and alienating voters. Dissatisfaction has reached 61%, his highest as Labour leader, painting a picture of a prime minister fading in public esteem. Amid this turmoil, Nigel Farage‚Äôs Reform UK has exploded in popularity, often leading opinion polls and overtaking both Labour and the Conservatives in voting intentions. üö® NEW: Reform UK on course for a 64-seat majority ‚Äî wiping out Labour and the Tories. Labour down 319 seats. Conservatives down 93. Britain‚Äôs fed up with managed decline from both old parties. The message is clear: change isn‚Äôt coming from them ‚Äî it‚Äôs coming from us. pic.twitter.com/tr3G2VexL0 ‚Äî Darren Grimes (@darrengrimes_) August 11, 2025 Farage now boasts higher favourability than Starmer, capitalising on anti-immigration sentiments and promises of radical change. In a desperate attempt to stave off complete annihilation, Starmer‚Äôs government recently announced it is going to lower the voting age to 16, effectively allowing children to vote. If an election were held today, recent MRP projections suggest Reform could emerge as the largest party, potentially securing the most seats in a hung parliament or even nearing a majority, while Labour and the Tories face wipeout risks. This surge underscores a seismic shift, with Reform poised to capitalise on voter anger over migration, economic woes, and establishment fatigue. As the petition gains traction, it highlights a electorate hungry for upheaval. * * * Your support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

    "fullContent": "How Coca-Cola's Secret Formula Has Changed Over Time Coca-Cola debuted in 1886 as a pharmacy fountain drink. Its original syrup drew on coca leaves and kola nuts for stimulation and flavor. Over time, the recipe changed alongside regulations, technology, and tastes. In the following chart, Visual Capitalist's Bruno Venditti pairs a quick dataset with context on how ingredients and nutrition have evolved. The ingredient and nutrition snapshot for today‚Äôs U.S. Coca-Cola comes from Coca-Cola. From Coca to ‚ÄúDecocainized‚Äù Coca Early formulas included coca leaf extract, and small amounts of cocaine remained until the early 1900s. By 1903, the drug was removed amid changing laws and public health concerns. Coca-leaf flavoring persisted in ‚Äúdecocainized‚Äù form, prepared under license in the U.S. by a facility now operated by Stepan Company. These shifts preserved the brand‚Äôs flavor profile while complying with evolving regulation. The Big Sweetener Switch In the U.S., Coca-Cola transitioned from cane sugar to high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) during the 1980s, with reporting in 1984 noting the move across major soda brands. Cost and supply dynamics favored corn syrup at the time. Not every market followed: in the U.K., for instance, Coca-Cola Original lists ‚Äúsugar‚Äù rather than HFCS. This split explains why ‚ÄúMexican Coke‚Äù tastes different to some consumers. ‚ÄúI have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using real cane sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just better!‚Äù - Donald Trump U.S. Coke has six standard ingredients: carbonated water, HFCS, caramel color, phosphoric acid, natural flavors, and caffeine. A 20 fl oz (591 mL) bottle has ~240 calories, ~65 g added sugar, and ~75 mg sodium, though labels can vary. Because the 1886 recipe is proprietary and not publicly released, a direct comparison isn‚Äôt possible. Following Trump‚Äôs push, Coca-Cola has announced it will launch a new product sweetened with U.S.-produced cane sugar next fall.

    "fullContent": "Germany's Industrial Core Is Collapsing Under The US Trade Deal And The Green Agenda Submitted by Thomas Kolbe The asymmetrical trade agreement between the EU and the US will further worsen Germany‚Äôs recession. Yet neither politicians nor corporate leaders show any willingness to make the sweeping policy changes needed to reverse course. Germany‚Äôs economic data leaves no room for illusions. After contracting by 0.9% in 2023 and another 0.5% last year, the decline will continue this year. The Machine Room Has Been Blown Apart It is precisely the sectors that have sustained German prosperity for decades‚Äîautomobiles, construction, machinery‚Äîthat are under the heaviest pressure. Without the artificial boost from state spending‚Äînow accounting for half of GDP‚Äîthe private sector is set to shrink by 4‚Äì5% this year. Since 2018, total productivity has been in steady decline. This is also a social problem: Germany is importing hundreds of thousands of welfare migrants into its social systems, yet the economy would have to boom just to keep per capita prosperity from falling. A new survey by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) confirms what was already obvious: the EU‚ÄìUS trade deal will especially hurt Germany‚Äôs export-oriented economy. According to the survey, 58% of companies expect additional burdens, rising to 74% for firms with direct US business. Only 5% expect any benefit. ‚ÄúThis deal may have been politically necessary, but for many German companies it‚Äôs a bitter pill,‚Äù said DIHK CEO Helena Melnikov. ‚ÄúHigher tariffs, more bureaucracy, falling competitiveness‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs the price of the diplomatic truce between Washington and Brussels. As of Thursday, a general 15% tariff applies to exports to the US, hitting automotive and machinery manufacturers hardest. 89% of US-oriented firms report immediate disadvantages, 72% fear further tariff hikes, 80% worry about political arbitrariness in transatlantic trade, and more than half plan to scale back US operations. Business Was Already Weak In its May survey of over 21,000 companies, only 23% reported positive business expectations‚Äîdown five points‚Äîwhile 30% expected deterioration. In industry, one in three anticipates fewer orders. Just 19% plan to increase investment, while about a third plan to cut back. High energy prices, labor shortages, and political uncertainty are seen as the main drags. The DIHK forecasts a 0.3% recession for 2025, but adjusting for state spending, the real decline is closer to 4‚Äì5%. Daily surveys confirm the same message: Germany is being deindustrialized, losing hundreds of thousands of core-sector jobs. The social security deficits already emerging are just the beginning. Yet both politics and business refuse to conduct an honest diagnosis. The Green Deal remains sacrosanct. Energy costs for German industry are up to three times higher than for US competitors, double that of French firms‚Äîpushing energy-intensive sectors out of the country. Dancing Around the Golden Calf Nobody dares openly challenge Brussels‚Äô climate agenda. A rare exception came in June, when a group of works council representatives wrote an open letter to the Chancellor, naming the Green Deal as a root cause of decline. But most CEOs dodge the question. Mercedes-Benz chief Ola K√§llenius cites ‚Äúweak demand, high production costs, and US tariff uncertainty‚Äù for falling margins‚Äîbut ignores the Green Deal‚Äôs role. VW CEO Oliver Blume calls for lower energy prices and tax incentives for EVs‚Äîessentially more subsidies to keep the transition alive. Corporate leadership is now fused ideologically with the Green Deal. The energy transition has battered Germany‚Äôs industrial base: sectors like construction and automotive have been knocked completely off track. A Split Economy Events like the ‚ÄúMade for Germany‚Äù coffee chat between 61 CEOs and the Chancellor are symbolic of a corporatist mindset. Large corporations can adjust or relocate production to sidestep regulation, but small and medium-sized enterprises‚Äîthe Mittelstand‚Äîare being crushed. The Green Deal‚Äôs bureaucratic weight ultimately clears the field for big corporations by eliminating smaller competitors. The Mittelstand has no political backing, and many are fighting daily for survival‚Äîoften ending in bankruptcy. In H1 2025, insolvencies rose 9.4% year-on-year to 11,900 companies. There is still no sign of a policy shift on climate. The German corporate elite has failed to seize the initiative to force political change. Germany is heading for a hot autumn‚Äîeconomically and socially. * * * About the author: Thomas Kolbe, a German graduate economist, has worked for over 25 years as a journalist and media producer for clients from various industries and business associations.
