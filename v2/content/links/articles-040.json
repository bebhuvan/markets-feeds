    "fullContent": "Why Britain Arrests 30 People Every Day For Speech Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, In this engaging Triggernometry interview, Lord Toby Young, founder of the Free Speech Union, discusses the UK’s Online Safety Act and its implications for free speech. He traces the Act’s origins to a moral panic over children’s exposure to harmful online content like self-harm sites and pornography, initially introduced under Theresa May’s government and expanded under Boris Johnson. Young criticizes it as overly broad, leading to excessive content removal by platforms fearing massive fines or jail time for executives. He highlights how it has resulted in age-gating innocuous material, such as speeches on grooming gangs or historical blog posts, under the guise of child protection, while failing to include robust free speech safeguards. Why Britain Arrests 30 People EVERY DAY For Speech Watch the full episode with Lord Toby Young @toadmeister, right here on X. pic.twitter.com/qOcoC1siuX — TRIGGERnometry (@triggerpod) August 6, 2025 Young argues this creates a chilling effect, with companies over-censoring to comply, and expresses concern that the Labour government, under figures like Peter Kyle, will strengthen it further rather than repeal it. Young warns of broader threats to free expression, including over 30 daily arrests for speech offenses and a quarter-million non-crime hate incidents recorded in recent years, often for online posts challenging government narratives on immigration or gender issues. He discusses risks to anonymity and encrypted apps like WhatsApp, potential blasphemy law revivals via anti-Islamophobia measures, and new employment laws that could ban “banter” in workplaces to prevent perceived harassment. Emphasizing the Free Speech Union’s role in defending cases—primarily gender-critical women—he notes a surge in membership since Labour’s election, underscoring growing public unease. Overall, Young portrays the UK as sliding toward authoritarian censorship, prioritizing “safety” over liberty and stifling open debate. Your support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

For those who may not be in the seat, or have a clue as to just what the daily roller-coaster has been like for the last seven months and counting, Harris Kupperman, CIO of Praetorian Capital posted the following on X, which although a little tongue in cheek, is awfully close to the reality of anyone trying to trade this chaos. Brace yourself, as Kuppy says \"Every fuckin' day bro... every one!\": 6:00 - Wake up, check what Trump tariffed overnight. Cambodia up +200%, Paraguay -3% (they said thanks). 6:05 - Brew some coffee. 6:10 - Trump tweets that the laws are rigged, since he cannot tariff Arizona. Mentally scroll the portfolio for exposure… 6:15 - Check what happened in Asia and Europe. 6:22 - Trump announces that hot dogs will join the food pyramid. Bans hot dog exports. Fortunately our book dodged that one. 6:30 - Drink some coffee, talk to wife, pray Trump will spend the morning golfing so I can do some actual work... 6:31 - Trump announces that oil at $65 is too high. Threatens anyone who isn’t producing more oil. 6:32 - Top 5 position announces earnings, want to join the earnings call at 7am, but Trump just scheduled a press conference then, and he’s looking unpredictable. 7:02 - Trump announces that Japan can now export golf balls tariff-free, in honor of Abe letting him cheat at golf. Join the earnings call instead. 7:06 - Futures plunge 65 handles in a single tick, frantically leave the earnings call and go back to whatever Trump is still yapping about in his press conference. 7:10 - Scroll through premarket quotes. NVDA and PLTR are both up 5% b/c it’s a day ending in ‘Y’ but SPZ are now down 80 handles. 7:15 - Trump changed his mind and SPZ are now up 25 handles as everyone rushes to cover their short. (I re-join the earnings call) 7:30 - Some broker I’ve never heard of just downgraded a top 5 position and it’s down 15% on 300 shares traded. I’m pretty confident it will close around there too. (I crack open a beer as I skim his downgrade report, realizing that nothing productive will happen today…) 8:00 - An LP calls to remind me of some ShitCoin he recommended that’s now up 1800% since he recommended it. 8:09 - 10-yr bonds gap down 17 bps, but all I can find is a tweet from Bessent about how great Main Street is doing. 8:15 - Some sell side asshole cold-calls me to see if I want a copy of his upgrade report on the AI sector. Tells me that “it’s going to be big and you don’t want to miss it.” 8:20 - Check my email, do 10 minutes of actual work. 8:30 - Trump threatens Brazil, I realize our BZ exposure is gonna get thumped on the open. (Crack open a 2nd beer) 8:33 - Reminisce about how productive I was, since Biden wouldn’t even wake up until noon. 8:40 - Chat with my CFO for 19 mins about some new compliance form we need to file. 8:59 - Trump Tweets about how stupid Powell is. Futures are back down 30 handles. 9:04 - Join a call 4 mins late with an endowment that wants an update, but 100% will never invest. “BTW - we need you to update the DDQ as we’ve changed our format” 9:29 - Casino is opening. Let’s see what happens. 9:32 - I’m bored. Go back to reading emails. Turns out the govt created another new form we ALSO need to fill out… 10:00 - We’re actually up 50bps. 10:03 - Now down 175bps. Trump just threatened to bomb Europe. 10:06 - Tweets he was just joking about Europe. But those guys need to get their shit together bc he might still bomb them. 10:08 - Ready for bourbon. Beer won’t cut it… 10:30 - EIA oil inventory shows yet another massive draw. Oil drops 5% anyway. 10:40 - Don Jr’s latest SPAC rallies 300% on rumors it may launch a new ShitCoin 10:45 - Friend calls to cry about how cheap all his names are. We both agree we were idiots to invest in businesses with earnings. 11:22 - Trump reminds everyone about how much Putin likes him. 11:40 - Realize I’m now too tweaked to sit in the office. Turn off the machines and go get lunch with a friend who’s also gonna bitch about how stupid markets have become. 12:05 - Hostess at restaurant pitches me some ShitCoin. Claims she’s up a few million on it 12:07 - Friend starts bitching about how stupid it is to be an investor under Trump, and how we all made money under Biden. I agree with him, but we both agree it would be even stupider under Kamala… For more from Harris, visit Kuppy’s Korner blog at http://pracap.com Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 06:11",

    "fullContent": "CDC Reveals Children Have Highest Intake Of Ultra-Processed Foods 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) coverage in the corporate media has spiked in recent days, marking one of the highest story counts in months. The timing isn't a coincidence, given that the 'back to school' season is fast approaching and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is preparing to roll out new national dietary guidelines next month. On Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a new nutrition survey showing that Americans receive more than half of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods, with salty and sugary items making up an even larger share of children's diets. This heavily processed diet is fueling America's health crisis. Here are the highlights from the CDC's new report titled \"Ultra-processed Food Consumption in Youth and Adults: United States, August 2021–August 2023\": Overall: Americans aged 1+ consumed 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. Youth (ages 1–18): Averaged 61.9%, with the highest intake in children aged 6–11 (64.8%). Adults (19+): Averaged 53%, with intake decreasing as age increases (down to 51.7% for those 60+). Top sources: Sandwiches (incl. burgers), sweet bakery goods, savory snacks, sweetened beverages, pizza (for youth), and breads/tortillas (for adults). CDC explained, \"Ultra-processed foods tend to be hyperpalatable, energy-dense, low in dietary fiber, and contain little or no whole foods, while having high amounts of salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats. Ultra-processed food consumption has been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.\" Here are the ultra-processed food groups that were top sources of calories among youth and adults... The findings support Secretary Kennedy's move to revise U.S. dietary guidelines and reduce reliance on the processed foods industrial complex. On Monday, Secretary Kennedy and others celebrated \"MAHA Monday\" with the announcement that six more states have agreed to remove junk food from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Speaking at the press conference earlier this week at the White House, Secretary Kennedy said, \"Taxpayer dollars shouldn't go to junk food that makes our kids sick. We're fixing that—state by state, step by step—to Make America Healthy Again.\" Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 05:45",
