Its direct exposure to new US tariffs is relatively limited, but indirect effects through slower global demand and financial conditions may be larger. Strengthening regional trade integration through initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) can help build regional supply chains and reduce reliance on commodity exports. Africa's young workforce, digital innovation and rich natural resources provide longer-term growth tailwinds. Unlocking these opportunities requires investment in skills, infrastructure and financial integration to boost trade and value-added.",

    "summary": "This paper provides empirical evidence on which M&A deals spur innovation, and which stifle it. To do so, we consider not only the product market position of the acquiring firm, but also the position of both target and acquirer in the technology space. Focusing on the antidiabetic drugs market, our dataset tracks the lifecycle and patenting of all individual antidiabetic projects in development between 1997 and 2017. We show that most terminations of acquired projects occur while the projects are still far from product market entry. Nevertheless, a number of these early-stage acquisitions have a positive impact on innovation. These cases arise when incumbents acquire projects close to their own projects in product markets, but only if these projects are also close in technology markets. Those deals are associated with increased subsequent patenting, which is consistent with the exploitation of technological synergies. Our results point to the crucial role of combining both product mark",

    "summary": "One in nine workers worldwide experiences a non-fatal occupational accident, with nearly 750,000 French workers missing multiple workdays due to work-related injuries in 2003 alone. As multinational firms emphasize their superior management practices and ESG commitments, this study investigates whether foreign ownership enhances workplace safety. Using detailed plant-level data from France (2003–2017) and applying recent event study techniques to the full data as well as a matched sample, it finds that foreign acquisitions improve worker safety by reducing accident rates, the proportion of injured employees, and the share of lost workdays. These benefits are primarily driven by a decline in major accidents among blue-collar workers. The safety improvements coincide with post-acquisition organisational changes within the plant and the firm, including a higher ratio of hours worked by technical middle managers relative to blue-collar workers, an increase in organisational layers, a great",

Combining novel high-frequency geospatial temperature data from satellites with measures of economic activity for the universe of US listed firms, this article examines a potentially important channel through which global warming can lead to economic costs: temperature uncertainty. The results show that temperature uncertainty—by increasing power outages, reducing labor productivity, and increasing the degree of exposure of firms to environmental and non-political risks, as well as economic uncertainty at the firm-level—persistently reduce firms’ investment and sales. This effect varies across firms, with those characterized by tighter financial constraints being disproportionally more affected.",

    "summary": "Under inflation forecast targeting, central banks such as the ECB adjust policy to keep expected inflation on target. We evaluate the ECB’s inflation forecasts: they are unbiased and efficient but contain little information at forecast horizons beyond three quarters. In a New Keynesian model with transmission lags, inflation forecast targeting is indeed effective in stabilizing inflation—provided there is no forward-looking behavior—though the information content of forecasts is unrealistically high. In the presence of forward-looking behavior, the information content declines because monetary policy becomes more effective in meeting the target, but inflation is best stabilized by targeting current inflation.",

    "summary": "This paper examines the impact of economic sanctions on the choice of invoicing currencies in international trade, focusing on the sanctions imposed on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Using transaction-level data on Russia’s imports from 2016 to 2023, we document a significant shift away from US dollar (USD) invoicing toward increased use of the Chinese renminbi (CNY), particularly in trade with China and other neutral economies. By the second half of 2023, the CNY accounted for over a third of Russia’s import value, up from less than 4 percent in 2021. Employing a difference-in-difference approach, we identify several mechanisms driving this shift: geopolitical alignment, financial infrastructure such as currency swap lines with the People’s Bank of China, the threat of secondary sanctions, and rising transaction costs in Western currencies. Strategic complementarities and the exit of Western firms further accelerated this currency switching. Our ",

Indeed, population-adjusted real retail sales in the past have tended to turn negative one year or more before a recession has begun.In June, nominally retail sales rose a strong 0.6%. But because consumer prices rose 0.3%, real retail sales increased 0.3%.But hold the celebration, because even with this increase real retail sales in June were among the 4 weakest readings in the past 8 months, and are below all of their readings during the 4th Quarter of last year, as well as the front-running of tariffs that was apparent earlier this year:In other words, the trend is one of the stagnation of growth.With several exceptions, most notably in 2022-23, in the past 75 years whenever real retail sales turned negative YoY, a recession was about to begin or had just begun.

SotoWith the advent of generative AI (genAI), the potential scope of artificial intelligence has increased dramatically, but the future effect of genAI on productivity remains uncertain. The effect of the technology on the innovation process is a crucial open question. Some inventions, such as the light bulb, temporarily raise productivity growth as adoption spreads, but the effect fades when the market is saturated; that is, the level of output per hour is permanently higher but the growth rate is not. In contrast, two types of technologies stand out as having longer-lived effects on productivity growth. First, there are technologies known as general-purpose technologies (GPTs). GPTs (1) are widely adopted, (2) spur abundant knock-on innovations (new goods and services, process efficiencies, and business reorganization), and (3) show continual improvement, refreshing this innovation cycle; the electric dynamo is an example.",

Contrary to the general theme of deceleration which has been the case for several years now, initial claims appear to be breaking trend in the positive direction.Specifically, initial claims declined -7,000 last week to 221,000, their lowest reading since the end of March. The four week moving average declined -6,250 to 229,500, the lowest since the beginning of May. With the typical one week delay, continuing claims rose 2,000 to 1.956 million:On the YoY% basis more useful for forecasting, initial claims were down -7.9%, and the four week average down -1.6%, only the 3rd time in the past 10 months that this comparison has been lower, and the biggest YoY decline during that time. Only continuing claims remained higher, by 4.8%:This tells us that there are very few layoffs, even if those who are laid off are having a more difficult time landing a new job.
