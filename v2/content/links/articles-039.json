    "fullContent": "Tesla Fined $243 Million By Florida Jury In Autopilot Crash Lawsuit Authored by Naveen Athrappully via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Tesla shares responsibility for an accident involving its vehicle’s Autopilot system, and must pay $243 million as compensation, a jury from the District Court, Southern District of Florida, said in an Aug. 1 verdict. The logo of Tesla at a Tesla Super Charging station in Saint-Herblain near Nantes, France, on March 27, 2025. Stephane Mahe/Reuters The case stems from a collision involving a 2019 Tesla Model S equipped with automatic driving features, in which Tesla’s Autopilot allowed the car to “navigate without driver input,” according to a June 30 court document. The incident took place on April 25, 2019, when George McGee, the driver and owner of a 2019 Tesla Model S, slammed into a parked Chevrolet Tahoe, which then went on to strike two individuals—Naibel Benavides Leon and Dillon Angulo. While Leon died in the accident, Angulo suffered “significant injuries.” Subsequently, Leon’s representative and Angulo filed separate lawsuits against Tesla, which were eventually consolidated into a single lawsuit in March 2024. Out of the four charges laid out in the lawsuit, the court allowed two product liability claims against Tesla to move forward—defective design and failure to warn. On Aug. 1, a Florida jury agreed that Tesla placed the 2019 Model S in the market “with a defect which was a legal cause of damage” to the victims, according to the verdict form. They found that there was negligence on the part of driver McGee as well, which was also a legal cause of damage to Leon and Angulo. Tesla was assigned 33 percent of the accident’s responsibility by the jury, with McGee sharing 67 percent. Commenting on the verdict, law firm Singleton Schreiber LLP, representing the victims in the lawsuit, said in an Aug. 2 post that the jury “determined that Tesla was 33 percent at fault for allowing Autopilot use on roads it wasn’t designed for and failing to adequately monitor driver attention.” The jury awarded $35 million to Leon’s mother and $24 million to her father. For Angulo, the jury awarded $70 million in damages. In total, the plaintiffs were awarded $129 million, according to the Aug. 1 verdict. Since Tesla shared 33 percent of the responsibility, the company is due to pay a third of the $129 million, which comes to around $43 million. Plus, the jury also imposed a $200 million punitive damage on Tesla, bringing the total to $243 million. In an emailed statement to The Epoch Times, Tesla criticized the jury’s decision. “Today’s verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla’s and the entire industry’s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology. We plan to appeal given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial,” a company spokesperson said. “Even though this jury found that the driver was overwhelmingly responsible for this tragic accident in 2019, the evidence has always shown that this driver was solely at fault because he was speeding, with his foot on the accelerator—which overrode Autopilot—as he rummaged for his dropped phone without his eyes on the road.” Tesla said that no car, from 2019 or today, would have been able to prevent the crash. The company pointed out that the car’s driver had “admitted and accepted responsibility” for the incident since day one. Tesla said the punitive damages in the case will only amount to $127.5 million, lower than the $200 million mentioned in the jury verdict. “Florida law is explicit that punitive damages have been all but eliminated in product liability cases such as this one, so we are confident that the punitive damage award at a minimum, and likely this whole verdict, will be overturned by the appellate court,” the company said. Autopilot Under Scrutiny The plaintiffs’ lead lawyer, Brett Schreiber, acknowledged that the driver, George McGee, was negligent, but said that Tesla was at fault nonetheless. He said Tesla allowed drivers to act recklessly by not disengaging the Autopilot as soon as they begin to show signs of distraction, and by allowing them to use the system on smaller roads that it was not designed for, like the one McGee was driving on. Tesla’s decision to even use the term Autopilot showed it was willing to mislead people and take big risks with their lives because the system only helps drivers with lane changes, slowing a car, and other tasks, falling far short of driving the car itself, he said. The Epoch Times reached out to the plaintiffs’ attorney for comment and did not receive a response by publication time. McGee had previously settled with the victims and was cited for careless driving, according to the Aug. 1 post from Singleton Schreiber LLP. Tesla has faced regulatory scrutiny over the safety of its vehicles. In April 2024, the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Tesla’s Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 vehicle crashes, including 14 deaths and several serious injuries. In January, NHTSA announced it was investigating a feature on Tesla vehicles that allows drivers to move their vehicles remotely, via a phone app. The department had received a complaint, alleging that a crash occurred, from a person using this feature. On its website, Tesla says the Autopilot system is far safer than human drivers. “In Q2 2025, we recorded one crash for every 6.69 million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot technology. For Tesla drivers who were not using Autopilot technology, we recorded one crash for every 963,000 miles driven,” it said. The company said that setting a vehicle on Autopilot does not mean the driver doesn’t have to pay attention. “Autopilot is a driver assistance system that is intended to be used only with a fully attentive driver. It does not turn a Tesla into a fully autonomous vehicle. Before enabling Autopilot, you must agree to ‘keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times’ and to always ‘maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle,’” it said.

    "fullContent": "Gold Signals War - Martin Armstrong Warns Of \"Panic Cycle In 2026\" Via Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com, Less than two weeks ago, legendary financial and geopolitical cycle analyst Martin Armstrong warned his “Socrates” predictive computer program showed a “100% Chance of Nuclear War.” Since then, a war of words has flared up between President Trump and Russia, and he said Russia “has entered very dangerous territory.” President Trump then, “Orders US nuclear subs repositioned over statements from ex-Russian leader Medvedev.” “After Trump sends nuclear subs near Russia, Putin responds with hypersonic threat — what Oreshnik missiles can do.” If this is not enough to confirm some sort of nuclear exchange is coming soon, add what Secretary of State Marco Rubio just warned this past week. Rubio said, “In case of war with the US, Russia will rely on tactical nuclear weapons due to the weakness of its army.” A top Russian official also “Issues nuclear annihilation warning” and said Russia would “hit back with a devastating blow.” Keep in mind, all this happened in the last few days. On Friday, “gold signaled war” by exploding up $73 an ounce, up more than 2% in a matter of hours. Is the gold market seeing this nuke war talk and responding? Armstrong says, “Oh, yeah! You look at gold, and you see what is happening...\" \"Oil is pointing more towards September. . . . Gold keeps trying to get through the highs. This is not the major high. Hate to tell you, it’s not. Gold is showing, Up. Every market I look at, it’s the same thing. We have a panic cycle, and it’s not just for war in 2026. Go to our site and look at the euro, and there is a panic cycle for 2026. It’s everywhere. Why the computer has been correct is you cannot forecast any market in isolation. You can’t. It’s all connected.” Armstrong says you won’t have to wait until 2026 for his “Panic Cycle” to begin. His computer has long pointed to August 18, 2025, and that is about two short weeks away. Armstrong says, “Honestly, this is turning into a grade school fight. I don’t know what Trump expects. He’s hurling insult after insult, and there is no possibility of peace anymore. It’s one thing to do tariffs and sanctions against Russia. Now, he is saying we are going to put sanctions on anybody that even deals with Russia. This is economic war. It’s as simple as that. . .. We don’t even have anyone to negotiate on behalf of the West. It’s dead, completely dead.” Armstrong thinks neocons have built a wall around President Trump so nobody with different advice regarding NOT starting a nuke war can get through. Is Martin Armstrong being blocked by the neocons surrounding President Trump now? Armstrong says, “I believe so...\" \" I even wrote to AG Pam Bondi, and I did not get a response. I have written to presidents and heads of state, and I get responses. Not this time. . .. This is escalating, and he (Trump) is not in a good position. I don’t know what the hell he is doing. He seems to have crossed to the other side.” There is much more in the 48-minute interview.

    "fullContent": "Tesla Board Approves 96 Million Share Stock Award To \"Retain\" Elon Musk Tesla's Board approved a special interim equity award for Elon Musk to compensate and retain him for \"extraordinary work\". \"As you know, Elon has not received meaningful compensation for eight years since the 2012 CEO Performance Award was last earned in 2017,\" Robyn Denholm & Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, Members of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, wrote in a letter to shareholders on Monday morning. The Board continued, \"Despite overwhelming support from you in 2018 and again in 2024, our legal efforts continue in the Delaware courts to reinstate the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\" The equity award of restricted stock, totaling 96 million shares, is equal to about one-third of the compensation he earned under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The award provides the following conditions: 96 million restricted shares of stock, subject to Elon paying a purchase price upon meeting a two-year vesting term, to be delivered after receipt of antitrust regulatory approval; The purchase price will be equal to the split adjusted exercise price of the stock options awarded to Elon under the 2018 CEO Performance Award ($23.34 per share); A requirement that Elon serve continuously in a senior leadership role at Tesla during the two-year vesting term; • A pledging allowance to cover tax payments or the purchase price; A mandatory holding period of five years from the grant date, except to cover tax payments or the purchase price (with any sales for such purposes to be conducted through an orderly disposition in coordination with Tesla); and If the Delaware courts fully reinstate the 2018 CEO Performance Award, this interim award will be forfeited or returned or a portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will be forfeited. To put it simply, there cannot be any \"double dip.\" Elon will not be able to keep this new award in addition to the options he will be awarded under the 2018 CEO Performance Award should the courts rule in our favor. Tesla is at a critical inflection point with slumping sales and Musk pivoting the company to focus on robotaxis, cheaper EV platforms, humanoid robots, and AI. \"While we recognize that Elon's business ventures, interests and other potential demands on his time and attention are extensive and wide-ranging, including his leadership roles at xAI, SpaceX, Neuralink, X Corp., and The Boring Company as well as his other interests, we are confident that this award will incentivize Elon to remain at Tesla and focus his unmatched leadership abilities on further creating shareholder value for Tesla shareholders and attracting and retaining talent at Tesla,\" the Board said. A Letter to Our Shareholders on the 2025 CEO Interim Award Dear Fellow Tesla Shareholders, Today we announce an important first step in compensating Elon Musk for his extraordinary work at Tesla. As you know, Elon has not received meaningful compensation for eight years since… — Tesla (@Tesla) August 4, 2025 . . . Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 07:20",
