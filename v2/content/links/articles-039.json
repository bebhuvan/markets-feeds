Copenhagen is pledging to buy $500 million in arms that will be matched by the three Scandinavian countries. “Ukraine is not only fighting for its own security, but also for our security,” Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson. Source: DVIDS The Wall Street Journal reports this is the first of several weapon sales to Ukraine paid for by NATO members this summer. NATO and President Donald Trump recently unveiled a scheme to send Ukraine $10 billion in US weapons funded by Europe and Canada. However, several European countries have announced they will not participate in the program. The WSJ report makes mention of Kyiv's shopping list: NATO and Ukraine have established a shopping list of Kyiv’s requirements for lethal and nonlethal equipment, dubbed the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List. NATO, Ukraine and NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, U.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, will ensure the packages meet Kyiv’s needs. NATO is dividing the list into packages valued at roughly $500 million apiece Governments are making financial commitments toward the packages and NATO, which has pledged “rapid delivery from U.S. stockpiles” will coordinate delivery of the arms to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelensky celebrated the announcement. \"We already have commitments from the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark – over one billion dollars for American weapons that Ukraine will receive,\" he wrote on X. \"Thank you! This cooperation with NATO countries will continue.\" The Ukrainian leader also said he had a \"productive\" conversation with President Donald Trump. Zelensky says he spoke with Trump about adding new sanctions on Russia. According to Reuters the scheme also allows for countries that donate weapons to Ukraine to have priority access to receiving replacement arms from the US. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 05:00",

    "fullContent": "Cathay Pacific Makes First Boeing Widebody Purchase Since 2013 Cathay Pacific Airways is set to purchase 14 Boeing 777-9 jets for $8 billion, with options for seven more, marking a major expansion of its long-haul fleet. Notably, this is the Hong Kong-based airline's first order of Boeing widebody aircraft since 2013, according to Bloomberg. The timing of the deal might be significant, as it comes when U.S.-China trade negotiations remain ongoing. Cathay Pacific is a publicly traded airline listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Its ownership is disproportionately concentrated in three major stakeholders: Swire Pacific Limited (Swire Group) at 45%, Air China Limited at 30%, and Qatar Airways at just under 10%. The three make up about 75% ownership of the airline, with the other 25% of its shares held by other institutional investors. The deal for the new 777-9 jets won't be delivered until 2034, and suggests two things: Long-term confidence in travel demand remains strong. Ongoing positive trade talks between the U.S. and China. Earlier this year, China used non-tariff countermeasures during the first leg of the tit-for-tat trade war with the Trump administration. One such move by China: Trade War Turbulence: Chinese Airline Delays Boeing Jet Delivery In Possible Non-Tariff Countermeasure The fact that Beijing did not object to Cathay Pacific's 777-9 order should be viewed as a positive sign. Big thanks to @cathaypacific for your order for 14 more 777-9s! 🙌✈️ With a total of 35 jets on order, Cathay Pacific is now set to become the largest 777X operator in the Asia Pacific region. 🌏 More: https://t.co/WKGuOtIV0W pic.twitter.com/Cxs1JcjzZI — Boeing Airplanes (@BoeingAirplanes) August 6, 2025 On Tuesday, President Trump said his trade negotiators were close to striking a deal with China, and that if an agreement materializes, he would meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, before the end of the year. \"He asked for a meeting, and I'll end up having a meeting before the end of the year most likely, if we make a deal. If we don't make a deal, I'm not going to have a meeting,\" Trump told CNBC in an interview, referring to China's Xi. The president noted, \"We're getting very close to a deal. We're getting along with China very well.\" Hints like Cathay Pacific placing its first widebody jet order from Boeing in over a decade are promising signs that U.S.-China trade relations could find some common ground in the near to medium term.
