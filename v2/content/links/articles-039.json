Wes Moore's Approval Plummeting The Democratic Party is in trouble over their beloved Maryland Governor Westley Watende Omari Moore, who is being positioned for the party's 2028 presidential run, as his polling numbers crater amid a tsunami of mounting crises. I wonder why. https://t.co/IC5BQgL9h7 — Robin Grammer (@RobinGrammer) August 11, 2025 \"Governing is hard. Just ask Governor Wes Moore — plummeting 14 points in a year, scraping a dismal 50% approval in deep-blue Maryland,\" Change Annapolis, a bipartisan group of taxpayers, wrote in a post on X. Change Annapolis continued, \"Marylanders are tired of his presidential vanity tour, crushing tax hikes, and an energy crisis of his own making,\" adding, \"He's polling worse than O'Malley and Glendening at this point in their terms.\" Gov. Moore and his team of leftist radicals are running Annapolis into the ground, fueling a series of crises: a fiscal disaster and massive deficit, crushing tax hikes (setting the stage for a continued resident exodus to GOP-led states), an open-door haven for criminal illegal aliens, crime-ridden streets across major metros, and, worst of all, what's now being formally acknowledged: a full-blown \"manufactured\" power crisis. This energy crisis, a direct byproduct of failed green policies (in combination with AI data centers), has ignited power bill hyperinflation, hammering both poor and wealthy households while financially crushing mom-and-pop businesses. The first sign of the Democratic Party's panic over Moore's sliding poll numbers was in June, after a network of dark-money-funded NGOs purchased ad space on local radio stations and launched a propaganda brainwashing campaign to quell the growing wave of dissent surfacing across the state. Far-Left Panic: Dark Money NGO Floods Baltimore Airwaves With Propaganda To Save Governor https://t.co/UBLdVX7fXf — zerohedge (@zerohedge) June 28, 2025 In recent weeks, Moore has played the blame game, telling constituents that power bill hyperinflation is the direct result of the regional grid operator, PJM. Yet it was Democrats in the state that championed failed globalist \"green\" policies that led to the premature retirement of reliable fossil fuel power generation for intermittent solar and wind, leaving the grid more fragile than ever. It's an unbelievable disgrace what the Democrats have done to the people of this state. https://t.co/ogqeCHafQQ — Robin Grammer (@RobinGrammer) August 11, 2025 ... and residents found out on Monday afternoon about just how fragile the grid has become with all that fossil fuel spare capacity taken offline after hours of blackout power threats across central Maryland. \"Prepare Now\": Substation Failure Puts Baltimore At Risk Of \"Widespread\" Blackout https://t.co/pCbEvuXk7P — zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 11, 2025 The Maryland Freedom Caucus described yesterday's blackout threat as \"a direct result of radical, extremist energy policies from Maryland Democrats and Governor Wes Moore, which are driving reliable power plants toward closure and leaving our grid on the brink.\" In recent weeks, the Trump administration threw Democrats in the state a massive political lifeline to prevent rolling blackouts by granting a 90-day emergency waiver allowing the H.A. Wagner power plant to exceed pollution limits during peak energy hours. The exploding power bill crisis in Maryland, in the era of AI data centers, should have never existed if responsible lawmakers in Annapolis hadn't enacted foolish energy policies that retired stable fossil fuel power generation over some alleged climate crisis. The accountability monster has now been released in the state - and this has so far shown up in sliding poll numbers for Moore - that could get a whole lot worse if power bills continue marching higher. We've got some bad news. In one year, this will be the most popular chart on this site pic.twitter.com/h93gWXMoNL — zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 11, 2025 What a mess! And it will only get worse.

During a press briefing, a reporter asked Smith “Do you know what the chain of command is now?” referring to President Trump having deployed National Guard troops to the capital to restore law and order. Smith looked puzzled and responded “What does that mean?” NEW: Washington DC Police Chief Pamela A. Smith doesn't know what the \"chain of command\" means. Reporter: \"Do you know what the chain of command is now?\" Smith: \"What does that mean?\" Yikes. pic.twitter.com/HeJfqWxmnx — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) August 12, 2025 Wow. This woman has been on this planet for 57 years and she was today years old when she found out what chain of command meant. — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) August 12, 2025 How does a person get a job as a police officer, let alone Police Chief without knowing what that means? She seems to be checking off a lot of boxes. Black, female, lesbian? Perfect person to lead the police force in a liberal paradise. — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) August 12, 2025 That’s not hyperbole. For those wondering: yes, she's a DEI hire. pic.twitter.com/gvlWMfz2aX — Ena Gill (@JaiShreeRam90) August 12, 2025 Here’s a helpful crash course that a child could understand… Chain of command is like a boss ladder: the top boss tells the next one what to do, who tells the one below, and so on, down to the workers. Everyone follows orders from above to keep things organized. In police, officers obey sergeants, who obey captains, up to the chief—you!… — Grok (@grok) August 12, 2025 Okay, DC Police: President Trump, as Commander in Chief, is the big boss. He can take control in emergencies and picked AG Pam Bondi as his stand-in. So, orders go: Trump → Bondi → your Chief → you. Follow the ladder to keep things safe and organized! — Grok (@grok) August 12, 2025 Trump announced the deployment of approximately 800 National Guard troops to D.C. alongside the federalization of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department, citing a “public safety emergency” due to what he described as rampant crime and lawlessness in the nation’s capital. Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allows the president to take control of the police for up to 48 hours during emergencies, extendable to 30 days with congressional notification, to justify this unprecedented move. He claimed the city had been “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals,” pointing to high-profile incidents like the assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer during an attempted carjacking. Trump framed the deployment as “Liberation Day” for D.C., aiming to restore order and address issues like homelessness, graffiti, and potholes, with Attorney General Pam Bondi overseeing the police and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth coordinating the National Guard’s efforts.

    "fullContent": "Netanyahu: 'If We Wanted To Commit Genocide, It Would Have Taken Exactly One Afternoon' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the accusation that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, but at a recent press conference he employed a reference which stunned press pool reporters. \"If we had wanted to commit genocide, it would have taken exactly one afternoon,\" he had said, as quoted in Times of Israel. This comes as Israeli forces are increasingly accused of intentionally using starvation tactics to gain total submission of the enclave, which Tel Aviv has rejected as false. Image via LA Times Netanyahu has been on the defensive, doing back-to-back press conferences focused on foreign journalists, and seeking to also deflect accusations that Israel has not used humanitarian aid as a tool of war. There's been immense domestic and international criticism as he's chosen to puruse to total military defeat of Hamas, a goal which ultimatley could take years more to fully accomplish. Netanyahu further once again denied that the population of Gaza is undergoing starvation, also alleging that most of the civilians killed are used intentionally by Hamas as human shields. Below is more of what he had to say in context related to his firm comments on the question of genocide: \"There is no starvation. There hasn’t been starvation. There was a shortage. And certainly, there was no policy of starvation,\" Netanyahu said at the press conference. \"If we had wanted starvation, if that had been our policy, 2 million Gazans wouldn’t be living today after 20 months.\" He continued, \"It’s the same with genocide — if we had wanted to commit genocide, it would have taken exactly one afternoon.\" Netanyahu has also increasingly begun addressing the clear shift in the American Right, or at least some influential corners of it - such as Tucker Carlson or Marjorie Taylor Greene's commentary which has grown fiercly criticial of Israeli policies: Netanyahu is sounding the alarm on a new kind of war: a \"concerted effort\" to turn young Christians against Israel. He's blaming \"purchased influencers\" and a media that's rewriting history one post at a time. 🚨🇮🇱 NETANYAHU: THE BATTLE FOR THE HOLY LAND IS HAPPENING ON YOUR FEED Netanyahu is sounding the alarm on a new kind of war: a \"concerted effort\" to turn young Christians against Israel.

Denmark has become the latest European country to join humanitarian air drop operations over the Strip, amid the controversy over aid getting in. Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen has admitted that air drops are \"by no means an optimal way to deliver emergency aid\" - given the potential for harm to people on the ground. \"It is a kind of emergency solution, but it is also where we are now,\" he said.
