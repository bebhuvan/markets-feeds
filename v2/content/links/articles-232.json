    "fullContent": "Moldova Jails Popular Pro-Russian Governor, Outraging The Kremlin Just over two weeks ago Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) issued a statement accusing the West, under US leadership, of turning Moldova into a military outpost aimed at confronting Russia, akin to what has happened over several years with Ukraine. Moscow has also accused the West of long meddling in the Republic of Georgia with the same purpose in mind. The SVR's provocative statement, which came in mid-July said Washington wants to use the country as \"cannon fodder\" in future hostilities, which is allegedly being fast-tracked by Western foreign policy decision-makers. Now the tiny country with EU aspirations (having been granted candidate status in 2022) is front and center in regional headlines, after a main opposition figure was arrested for alleged Russian-ties related to corruption. Governor of the Russian-speaking Gagauzia autonomous region Evghenia Gutul, file image The Kremlin has accused Moldovan authorities of engaging in political persecution after a court sentenced the pro-Russian governor of Moldova’s autonomous Gagauzia region to seven years in prison on Tuesday. Gagauzia’s governor, Evghenia Gutul, is accused of channeling Russian funds to a banned political party. The government alleges that she transferred Russian money to the outlawed Shor Party between 2019 and 2022, paving the way for deeper 'Russian influence' in Gagauzia, a southern Moldovan region made up primarily of Russian-speaking ethnic Turks. Gutul, who has rejected the accusations, has appealed for international help - especially in messages to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. She had been under arrest since March 2025, but prior to that reportedly traveled to Moscow to gain the support of Kremlin officials. She has previously stated, \"A fabricated criminal case has been brought against me. The Anti-corruption Prosecutor's Office, under the influence of (Moldovan President Maia) Sandu, is targeting those who have improved lives in their country, worked for the benefit of the people, and opposed the government's destructive actions, rather than tackling corruption.\" Today, another court hearing took place in the fabricated criminal case against me — a case that has been political, not legal, from the very beginning. pic.twitter.com/FMtqeeOZ1M — Evghenia Gutul (@EvgheniaGutul) April 14, 2025 Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov blasted the ruling as \"clearly politically motivated\" as it represents \"open and arguably unlawful pressure on political opponents\" ahead of Moldova’s parliamentary elections this September. Peskov added, \"We are seeing the systematic suppression of opposition forces in Moldova, essentially stripping voters of the chance to choose freely. It’s clear that democratic standards and principles are being continuously undermined.\" Tensions are soaring, with pro-Gutul protesters taking to the streets, also after Moldovan President Maia Sandu's recent warning and allegation that Russia was preparing an \"unprecedented\" campaign to interfere in the small country's fall elections. The tiny Eastern European nation bordering Ukraine has experienced the same kind of internal political pro-EU vs. pro-Russia tug of war historically on display in other countries such as Ukraine or Georgia. One thing which has long alarmed the West is the presence of Russian 'peacekeeping' troops in Moldova's breakaway Transnistria region. As for Transnistria, although it has diverse ethnic demographics almost equally apportioned between Russians, Moldovans, Romanians and Ukrainians, the Russian demographic slightly ekes out its counterparts with a plurality of 29% of Transnistrians belonging to the group. NATO wants to bring Moldova directly into its orbit, and ultimately kick Russian troops out of the region. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 02:45",

    "fullContent": "Armenia & Azerbaijan To Ink Peace Memorandum Under Trump Mediation Via Middle East Eye Azerbaijan and Armenia are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding in Washington on Friday, committing to the pursuit of peace, according to regional sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Middle East Eye. The sources said that US President Donald Trump will host Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan at the White House for the signing ceremony. Although Armenia and Azerbaijan reached consensus on a draft peace agreement in March, Baku continues to insist on several additional conditions before finalizing the deal. Chief among Azerbaijan’s demands is that Yerevan amend its constitution to remove references to Azerbaijani territory, a step that would require a national referendum in Armenia. Anadolu Agency The anticipated White House summit follows a meeting between the two leaders in Abu Dhabi in July. Following the meeting, Aliyev said both countries could finalize the text of the agreement, or at least its main principles, within a few months and then initial them. \"Reaching an agreement on the basic principles, initialing them, and then working on the text can be an option,\" Aliyev said, emphasising that such an approach hinges on Armenia amending its constitution. Sources added that the two leaders are expected to sign a “letter of intent” rather than a draft peace agreement, providing Trump with a diplomatic achievement he has been seeking in the region since last month. Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov called his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan on Monday to inform him about the summit, a third regional source told MEE. Turkish foreign ministry sources said that Fidan discussed bilateral and regional issues with Bayramov. MEE has reached out to both Armenian and Azerbaijani governments for comment. One of the main sticking points remains the so-called Zangezur Corridor, which would link mainland Azerbaijan to its exclave, Nakhchivan, through Armenian territory. Armenia rejects the term Zangezur Corridor, arguing that it carries irredentist implications for its sovereign territory, known as Syunik. Last month, US Ambassador Thomas Barrack officially proposed that an American company could lease and operate the corridor for 100 years, aiming to address the concerns of both sides over security and reliability of the transport route. However, Armenia rejected the proposal, stating it would not lease its sovereign territory to any third country. A regional source familiar with the negotiations told MEE that Turkey initially suggested the idea of a private company, approved by both Armenia and Azerbaijan, managing the corridor. “However, the Armenian side demanded that the company also operate on the Nakhchivan side of the corridor, which was unacceptable to Baku,” the source explained.

After a bloody six-week war in late 2020, Azerbaijan launched a military operation in September 2023 to retake Nagorno-Karabakh, resulting in a ceasefire agreement. Most ethnic Armenians fled, and the breakaway region was officially dissolved on January 1, 2024. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 02:00",
