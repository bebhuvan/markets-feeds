    "fullContent": "Florida Man Turns In 50 Pounds Of Cocaine He Discovered Floating In The Ocean A Florida boater stumbled upon the plot of a Netflix cartel drama—23 tightly wrapped bricks of suspected cocaine bobbing five miles off Islamorada—and, in a shocking twist, didn’t grab them and speed away. Instead, he called the cops, according to the Daily Mail. The Monroe County Sheriff’s Office says the mystery mariner found over 50 pounds of black brick-shaped packages drifting in turquoise waters on Thursday. Deputies, with help from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, hauled the 23 kilos ashore. The stash was turned over to federal agents, who are now testing it, though officials are pretty confident it’s cocaine. Photos show the “party favors” floating serenely before being scooped up by law enforcement. Whether the Good Samaritan will get a reward—or just bragging rights—is unclear. The Daily Mail writes that holding onto cartel-marked cocaine isn’t just reckless; it’s a legal time bomb. “It should go without saying that retaining possession of (a washed-up block of drugs) is an incredibly bad idea…” Florida law firm Perlet & Shiner warned, noting that keeping a $100,000 brick could mean “grand theft in the first degree, which can carry up to 30 years in prison, plus significant fines.” The Keys are no stranger to “blow bales.” Just weeks ago, a Panhandle beachgoer stumbled across $500,000 worth of cocaine. Last year alone, authorities recovered over 180 pounds statewide, from floating bricks near Key West to stashes buried in Volusia County sand. Smugglers often dump cargo when chased by law enforcement, letting the currents—and occasionally storms like Hurricane Debby—deliver it ashore. It’s not just a human problem, either. Scientists have even raised concerns that dumped cocaine could be affecting Florida’s marine life—yes, including sharks. Which is one more reason to leave floating cartel care packages to the professionals. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 18:50",

    "fullContent": "The Linguistic Kill-Switch: Inside The Modern Propaganda Playbook Authored by Nick Giambruno via The Epoch Times, The next time someone sneers “conspiracy theorist,” “anti-vaxxer,” “climate denier,” “far right,” “hate speech,” “terrorist,” or the ever-popular “racist,” understand what they are really saying: stop thinking. These words are a linguistic kill-switch—engineered to short-circuit thought by triggering a reflexive emotional spasm. If you encounter someone using these words, you can be certain you are not dealing with someone interested in a good faith effort to find the truth. These terms are precision-guided psychological weapons, fired by unseen hands to herd the public mind. Recall the CIA’s own 1967 memo coining “conspiracy theorist” expressly to silence anyone doubting the magic-bullet fairy tale that supposedly killed JFK. Although they are a poor substitute for an actual argument, these propaganda terms unfortunately work on many people. Call someone one of these words and you no longer need to refute their ideas with facts, logic, or reason. The slur does the work like magic. Take the granddaddy of all elastic scare-labels: terrorism. One hundred years ago the word barely existed. Today it vaporizes civil liberties on contact. Glenn Greenwald nailed it: the T-word is “simultaneously the single most meaningless and most manipulated word in the American political lexicon.” The only difference between a freedom fighter and a terrorist is who controls the narrative. Greenwald elaborates: “There is this common paradox which is that the words that are most frequently used and have the greatest impact are often the words that are the most ill-defined. And therefore subject to manipulation, deceit, and propaganda. So the word ‘terrorist’ for example is something that pervades countless political discussions of great significance. And we are essentially at the point, literally, where if the government points to somebody and simply utters the word ‘terrorist,’ and large numbers of citizens… will cheer for whatever it is that is done… No matter how lawless, no matter how little evidence has been presented to justify it, the mere fact that they have been labeled a ‘terrorist’ is something that will basically cause a majority of people to sanction whatever is done. And yet what is so fascinating about the word ‘terrorist’ is that it really is a term that has absolutely no fixed meaning, it’s simply a term that means whatever the person wielding it wants it to mean.” Greenwald continues: “Because the word terrorism is so potent and shuts down all debate, the mere application of that label by the government, anonymously and with no evidence… has made huge numbers of people stand up and cheer the most radical power a government can seize, which is the power to target one’s own citizens for death, for assassination, in total secrecy and with no due process. And that to me really illustrates the potency of how these propagandistic terms are wielded…. If we’re really going to vest virtually unlimited power in the government to do anything it wants to people they call ‘terrorists,’ we ought at least to have a common understanding of what the term means. But there is none. It’s just become a malleable, all-justifying term to allow the US government carte blanche to do whatever it wants. ‘Terrorism’ is really more of a hypnotic mantra than an actual word.” In short, say the magic T-word and—poof—your rights, your property, your life evaporate, all without trial, all to thunderous applause. The Antidote Using these words is almost like casting a spell—most people who hear them become hypnotized, immediately stop thinking, and turn into easily herded automatons. Fortunately, the counter-spell is simple: demand consistent and logical definitions. Make them spell out exactly what they mean by “terrorist,” or “science denier.” Watch their argument collapse into ad hominem attacks, straw men arguments, appeals to emotion, and crocodile tears. And if that all fails they will play the “racist” card. That’s the playbook. In short, when sophistry is all they have, facts become kryptonite. The propaganda spell breaks the moment you refuse to flinch at the linguistic kill-switch. The good news is that it’s a fragile method of control; people can snap out of their hypnosis. And once they do, they never go back. It’s like pulling back the curtain to see the Wizard of Oz and still being intimidated by him… that just doesn’t happen. So never stop asking questions and thinking critically. Don’t be intimidated by cowards, intellectual midgets, charlatans, and petty tyrants who use propaganda words to get you to shut up and stop thinking. And when they reach for the next emotionally-charged empty label, smile and say: “Is that all you’ve got?” * * * You’ve just seen how a handful of engineered words can disarm an entire population. Refusing the verbal trap is only half the battle—real protection requires action before the next wave of crises rolls in. Currency debasement, confiscatory policies, and the weaponization of language are accelerating. We’ve built a concise, free briefing that shows exactly what’s coming next and the three moves you can make right now to safeguard your money, your mobility, and your freedom.

    "fullContent": "The Dark Side Of Big Solar Exposed As The Fight To Save Farmland Heats Up This is precious farmland. Now this is precious farmland bulldozed in the name of the so-called \"green\" energy movement - all to fight a 'climate crisis' that exists more in the headlines of leftist corporate propaganda media outlets than in the actual world. Remember this... Citizens around the world have been spoon-fed doomsday climate propaganda for decades - and warned of an impending climate apocalypse that never arrives. Yet every year, climate taxes increase and energy costs soar, as well as power grid reliability crumbles. Why? Because climate alarmist progressives have hijacked energy policy, pushing reckless green agendas that are now backfiring. Spain's blackout a few months ago provided a glimpse into what it truly means to be 'net zero' for a day... Now, households and businesses across the U.S. Mid-Atlantic are feeling the pain as their power bills skyrocket, courtesy of Democrat-led green energy delusion... Since 2015, global solar installations have outpaced all fossil fuels combined. In 2024, the U.S. solar sector grew significantly, and public support for solar is at an all-time high. Yet there's a dark side to solar. We already know it's an unreliable form of power generation, but did you know one of its major drawbacks is the massive land requirement? Solar projects are now surpassing 200 megawatts in size, and to support them, companies are gobbling up vast swaths of precious farmland. This land grab has ignited the early stages of a global revolt. \"From Spain to Texas and India to England, solar projects are encroaching on prime agricultural land. Farmers and ranchers are fighting back,\" energy expert Robert Bryce explained in a new short-form documentary titled \"SUNBLOCK: The Global Fight To Save Farmland From Big Solar.\" Here’s a trailer for my short new documentary on the global fight to save farmland from Big Solar. You can watch the entire 10-minute film by clicking here: https://t.co/XBoesYprxJ pic.twitter.com/WbDIM4fKjG — Robert Bryce (@pwrhungry) August 5, 2025 Bryce highlighted the glaring inefficiency of the green energy push: a 270-megawatt solar plant in Texas that consumes 2,300 acres of farmland, while a 1,200-megawatt natural gas facility down the road delivers 88 times more power on just 26 acres... So for the \"efficiency\" of the green revolution... Bryce pointed out - and we agree - that the most efficient forms of power for fueling AI data centers and other emerging electrification trends are nuclear and natural gas. Solar may work well on the rooftops of homes or businesses, but as the energy expert warned, its dark side lies in the massive land grab of valuable farmland. Is there a secret agenda behind the destruction of farmland for sprawling fields of unreliable solar panels? It's time to reevaluate the solar agenda - and hold leftist lawmakers accountable in elections, from city halls to Capitol Hill, for pushing climate crisis propaganda that's devouring our farmland in pursuit of a utopian green fantasy that will never materialize (well, it will with nuclear).

    "fullContent": "Trump Admin Unveils Rule 'To Unleash American Drone Dominance' Authored by Jackson Richman via The Epoch Times, The Trump administration has announced a proposed rule on drones aimed at stimulating the U.S. drone market. “We are going to unleash American drone dominance,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at an Aug. 5 press conference. Duffy noted that China dominates drones with 90 percent control of the market. “We’re turning over our skies to one of our main adversaries,” he said. The new rule would allow people to get products such as a Starbucks cup of coffee via drone, he said, adding that it will also change energy production, farming, manufacturing, and filmmaking. This regulation deals with drones being flown beyond the visual line of sight. It will be open to public comment for 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. “Operators in the past would have to get individual waivers to operate these drones, very complicated. They were issued on a case-by-case basis, and because of that complication, I don’t think we saw the innovation that we should have in America,” Duffy said. “We are going to eliminate that prior process, and the approval will be done in a far different way. The rules are going to completely change the way that drone use is going to be approved, and what this is going to do is, again, allow our innovators and businesses to continue to create and innovate and change the way our industry works with the use of these drones.” Under the regulation, commercial drones would operate at under 400 feet above ground, and operators would need Federal Aviation Administration approval to fly them in certain airspaces. The drones can weigh up to 1,320 pounds, including what they’re carrying. The proposed regulation was developed under an executive order that President Donald Trump signed on June 6 titled “Unleashing American Drone Dominance.” “The United States must accelerate the safe commercialization of drone technologies and fully integrate UAS into the National Airspace System,” it stated. “The time has come to accelerate testing and to enable routine drone operations, scale up domestic production, and expand the export of trusted, American-manufactured drone technologies to global markets. “Building a strong and secure domestic drone sector is vital to reducing reliance on foreign sources, strengthening critical supply chains, and ensuring that the benefits of this technology are delivered to the American people.” The rule would also require operators to address security risks, such as protecting drones from intentional electronic interference.

    "fullContent": "Texas Deputy Threatens To Ticket \"Everyone\" Because She Didn't Get Laid The Night Prior A Texas deputy is learning the hard way that TikTok clout doesn’t mix well with police work—especially when your viral joke involves ticketing everyone because you “didn’t get cracked last night.” The now-deleted video featured Harris County Precinct 5 Deputy Jennifer Escalera in full uniform, scribbling on a notepad, with the caption: “Didn’t get cracked last night so everyone is getting a ticket.” She blurred parts of her uniform but left her nametag clearly visible—because nothing says “low-profile investigation” like tagging yourself in your own controversy., according to the NY Post. The constable’s office was not amused. “Our administration is aware and internal affairs has opened an investigation. We have no other comment at this time,” they told Fox 26. Translation: please stop sending us screenshots of her TikTok. The Post writes that Escalera, sworn in back in September 2021, has a TikTok history filled with uniformed posts, sometimes about the balancing act of being a cop and a mom. In one video she’s seen getting ready for work with the text: “contemplating if I really need this job, knowing that I do.” After this week, she might be contemplating it even harder. Local residents weren’t impressed with her attempt at humor. “I think it’s really inappropriate and disrespectful,” said Alex Fitch, who added, “It makes them look unprofessional when they start posting videos like that. You can’t take them seriously… Then they wonder why, when you see them, they say, ‘Why don’t you respect me?’ Well, you don’t treat yourself like a woman, and you ain’t treating yourself like a police officer.” \"I feel like they're playing. They're childish. They ain't taking nothing serious. You gon write me a ticket because you ain't get cracked? That's crazy, but that's the society and world we live in today,\" one resident said to Fox 26. In other words: less thirst-trapping TikTok, more traffic safety.
