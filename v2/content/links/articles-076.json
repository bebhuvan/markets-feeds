    "fullContent": "\"Expect Violence\" - Larry Klayman Says Trump Must Take Out Deep State Now Via Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com, Renowned attorney Larry Klayman says the coming indictments of the Deep State traitors who tried to frame President Trump as a Russian spy in his first term are all in serious trouble. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard charges that Obama Administration officials politicized intelligence and laid the groundwork for a “years-long coup” against President Donald Trump after he won the 2016 election. Gabbard first uncovered a mountain of documents implicating many in the so-called Deep State. Gabbard claimed in a post on X that former President Barack Obama and key members of his national security team, including then-CIA Director John Brennan and then-DNI James Clapper, fabricated a narrative about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election to “subvert” Trump’s presidency. They even made up evidence, such as the so-called Steele Dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton. They were all lies to make President Trump look bad. If these people are not stopped now while Trump is in office, and in control of the DOJ, then they will come after him when he is out of office and no longer in power. Klayman says, “Why is this different from the past?\" \"President Trump and the people around him, including Tulsi Gabbard, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, Dan Bongino and others, have learned what they are up against. They’ve tried now to assassinate the President twice. I believe the Left and the Democrats were behind it. I think they wanted him dead. They did not want him (Trump) to be elected. There was also all the lawfare (like warfare) over the last many years. It’s obvious Trump and his team have come to the conclusion that they have to get the Left and the Deep State before they get them.” Klayman says President Trump is at greater risk now than anytime in the past. Klayman explains: “Because President Trump has been so successful thus far, he is at great risk. There will likely be other assassination attempts and on the lives of other people in the cabinet. There will be attempts of assassination of anybody who supports him. I was in California recently, and I was wearing my Trump inauguration jacket from 2017, and some guy starts screaming I was a Nazi and this and that. I did not respond because I was in the middle of a bank. There is so much hatred out there, and this is why they have to take these people out legally and peacefully.” Klayman points out people have the right to defend themselves, especially in the home, and Klayman urges people to use their Second Amendment rights if and when there is a need to do so. As the indictments come down in the not-so-distant future, expect violence. Klayman says, “The Left has its back up against the wall. They are a drowning man, so to speak. . .. There will be violence. They will try to foment violence. Who is likely to be indicted? Klayman names a few for starters. This list includes John Brennan, James Clapper, Peter Strzok and Mark Elias. Then Klayman predicts, “They will first go for the low hanging fruit before they get to Hillary Clinton and other higher ups. They will see if they can flip them. This time it’s different, and this time I believe there will be some accountability.” There is much more in the 58-minute interview.

    "fullContent": "\"Tariffs Have Not Caused Inflation\" - Trump Rages At \"Bad Predictions\", Slams Goldman CEO Update (1020ET): President Trump rage-posted about the lack of inflation amid all the tariff-fearmongering... \"Trillions of Dollars are being taken in on Tariffs, which has been incredible for our Country, its Stock Market, its General Wealth, and just about everything else. It has been proven, that even at this late stage, Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other problems for Country, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury’s coffers. Also, it has been shown that, for the most part, Consumers aren’t even paying these Tariffs, it is mostly Companies and Governments, many of them Foreign, picking up the tabs. \" Then took direct aim at Goldman Sachs: \"But David Solomon and Goldman Sachs refuse to give credit where credit is due. They made a bad prediction a long time ago on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves, and they were wrong, just like they are wrong about so much else. I think that David should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ, and not bother running a major Financial Institution.\" Ouch! Meanwhile, just between us girls, Goldman has been somewhat more in the 'one-time, marginal' incremental impact of tariffs (as opposed to the UMich terror tantrum), with one of their latest notes highlighting the \"\"Sharp Declines\" In Import Prices As Foreigners Absorb Trump's Tariffs.\" well would you look at that: three days later Powell has to discuss this chart https://t.co/6AfkRRSjJp pic.twitter.com/SOGjff2Fsl — zerohedge (@zerohedge) June 25, 2025 ...even though Jan Hatzius did claim that US firms are eating up to two-thirds of the increased tariff costs most recently (even though that was not evident in the earnings data this season). American consumers have absorbed roughly 22 percent of the costs from President Donald Trump’s tariffs through June, but that is expected to swell to 67 percent by year‑end if the pattern of past levies holds, Goldman Sachs economists said in a note this week. Businesses have so far carried around 64 percent of the costs, and foreign exporters about 14 percent, according to the analysis led by Jan Hatzius. By December, Goldman expects businesses’ share to fall below 10 percent and foreign exporters’ share to rise to 25 percent. The bank projects the shift will lift core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation—a key Federal Reserve gauge—to 3.2 percent in December versus 2.4 percent without tariff effects. In June, core PCE inflation came in at 2.8 percent. * * * With a new boss looming at The BLS, one wonders what the 'old boss' has in hand for today's CPI data (with consensus seeing both headline and core YoY price changes ticking higher) after June's consumer prices came in cooler than expected, disappointing the Trump Tariff Tantrum crowd. Will this time be different... Will the dreaded tariff-flation show up this time? Headline CPI rose 0.2% MoM in July (as expected) and +2.7% YoY (cooler than the 2.8% expected) and in line with the June print... Source: Bloomberg Headline CPI rose 0.2%, after rising 0.3% in June. CPI Core rose 0.3% in July, following a 0.2% increase in June. Indexes that increased over the month include medical care, airline fares, recreation, household furnishings and operations, and used cars and trucks. The indexes for lodging away from home and communication were among the few major indexes that decreased in July. Core CPI rose 0.3% MoM (as expected) but YoY rose 3.1% (hotter than the 3.0% expected) - the highest since February... Source: Bloomberg Under the hood, Fuel Oil and Transportation costs rose the most but Gasoline and Food at Home costs fell MoM... Core CPI MoM Details: The shelter index increased 0.2 percent over the month. The index for owners’ equivalent rent rose 0.3 percent in July as did the index for rent. Conversely, the lodging away from home index fell 1.0 percent in July. The medical care index increased 0.7 percent over the month, following a 0.5-percent increase in June. The index for dental services increased 2.6 percent in July and the index for hospital and related services increased 0.4 percent. The physicians’ services index rose 0.2 percent over the month, while the prescription drugs index fell 0.2 percent. The index for airline fares increased 4.0 percent over the month, after declining 0.1 percent in June. The recreation index increased 0.4 percent over the month, as did the household furnishings and operations index. The index for used cars and trucks rose 0.5 percent in July and the index for personal care rose 0.4 percent. The new vehicles index was unchanged over the month while the communication index fell 0.3 percent. Annual changes: The shelter index increased 3.7 percent over the last year. Other indexes with notable increases over the last year include medical care (+3.5 percent), household furnishings and operations (+3.4 percent), motor vehicle insurance (+5.3 percent), and recreation (+2.4 percent). Goods inflation is accelerating (some will argue 'tariffs', some will argue fuel) while Services inflation has stabilized... Source: Bloomberg The latest inflation report continues to show no negative impact from tariffs. Core goods prices were up 0.2% in July. They are up just 1.1% over the past 12 months and are actually up a lesser 0.8% since President Trump began phasing in tariffs. — Joseph Lavorgna (@Lavorgnanomics) August 12, 2025 There is one problem in the data... SuperCore CPI (Services ex-Shelter) rose 0.55% MoM (hottest since January) and up 3.59% YoY (hottest since February)... Source: Bloomberg The jump in Transportation costs and Medical Care Services stood out for SuperCore (neither seem like they are affected in any way by tariffs)... 3m and 6m annualized CPI is also refusing to bow to the terror predicted by Trump tariff haters... So, not exactly the screaming spike in prices that Democrats interviewed by UMich have hallucinated about? It is worth noting that 32% of the inputs for CPI are now 'imputed' using the un-preferred \"different cell\" method... Different cell imputation expands the search to include prices for similar items or prices in a broader geographic area. While different cell imputation does not introduce bias, it can lead to greater volatility in the CPI data. Tiffany Wilding, Pimco economist, tells Bloomberg TV that tariff-related pressures are contained within certain areas of the report: “It’s very concentrated within goods, it’s happening slowly, and outside of that, inflationary pressures look very manageable. So I think for a Federal Reserve, that is a very good sign.” Art Hogan, B. Riley Wealth chief market strategist, weighs in: “Core goods are the real driver of the move up in the index, while being somewhat offset by energy and shelter cost. The report will likely not change the path forward for the Fed, as we expect to see rate cuts at the next three meetings.” Rate-cut expectations rose after the CPI print with September now trading at 95%... But there is a silver lining... The new BLS commissioner will not be fired today — zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 12, 2025 So, Airfares, Dental Care, Auto Insurance, Medical Care, and Rent were among the biggest drivers of upside in CPI... NONE of which have ANYTHING to do with tariffs (even if you squint) And tariff-related items such as New Cars, Apparel, and Toys barely budged. And cue the \"just wait until next month\" arguments!!... Liesman: \"I don't want to rain on the market's parade here\" Kernen: \"You do\" — zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 12, 2025 Tyler Durden Tue, 08/12/2025 - 14:11",
