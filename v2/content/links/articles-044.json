    "fullContent": "US Startup Scoops Up Bankrupt Northvolt's $5B European Gigafactory Assets By Charles Kennedy of OilPrice.com California-based Lyten has signed a binding agreement to acquire nearly all remaining assets of failed European battery firm Northvolt, including its Swedish and German gigafactories and all remaining intellectual property. In the deal, announced on Thursday, the company confirmed it would take over Northvolt Ett, Northvolt Labs, and Northvolt Drei, including projects developed with more than $5 billion in capital investment. According to Energy-Storage.news, the assets include 16GWh of operational lithium-ion capacity at Ett, with an additional 15GWh still under construction at Drei. Lyten plans to immediately restart production at Ett and the adjacent R&D complex, while continuing construction in Germany. Several Northvolt executives are expected to join Lyten as part of the transition, the Financial Times reported. Northvolt, once the EU’s flagship battery champion, filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. in late 2024 and in Sweden this March. Its collapse followed escalating delivery delays, cost overruns, and financing shortfalls. At its peak, the company had raised more than $10 billion and was considered central to Europe’s energy storage ambitions, according to Reuters. This latest deal follows Lyten’s earlier acquisition of Northvolt’s Polish energy storage division, Northvolt Dwa, as well as the California-based lithium-metal battery firm Cuberg. The company now controls nearly all of Northvolt’s former assets. Per Energy-Storage.news, Lyten’s chief business officer Keith Norman said lithium-ion deliveries from Dwa will begin in Q4, with plans to later integrate lithium-sulfur chemistry based on demand. Lyten is also in talks with Canadian officials to acquire Northvolt Six, a Quebec-based facility with integrated cell, cathode, and recycling lines. A $200 million funding round completed in July will help finance the acquisition, restart manufacturing, and support the company’s lithium-sulfur transition roadmap.

    "fullContent": "For The First Time Since COVID Crash, Credit-Card Debt Shrinks For Second Month On the surface, there were no major surprises in today's consumer credit report: after last month's $5.1 billion increase, consensus expected a sequential increase of $7.5 billion and it got almost exactly that: an increase of $7.37 billion to $3.758 trillion, up from $3.749 trillion in May. However, taking a closer look at the components reveals something troubling. While boring non-revolving credit increased by $8.4 billion or more or less in line with what it has done in recent months... ... an increase that in Q2 was driven in roughly equal part from contribution in student loans (+8.2BN) and auto loans (+$5.1)... ... the surprise was in the amount of revolving loans, i.e. credit card debt, which declined by just over $1 billion in June, which was the second consecutive monthly drop in the series... ... which is very notable because that would make it the first time since the economic collapse at the peak of the covid crash. Which begs the question: is the a cause - i.e., will the economy now suffer a sharp slowdown with consumers clearly hunkering down and no longer charging it - or effect - has the economy already stalled and this is just the consequence. If indeed this is the latter, then expect a dramatic downward revision of all recent economic data, similar to what we saw last week with payrolls, as the US economy enters its new glideslope to a recession.

    "fullContent": "Democrats' Trust In Institutions Hits New Record Low While Republicans' trust in U.S. institutions has surged recently, that of Democrats has reached a new all-time low. This is the result of an ongoing survey by Gallup. Statista's Katharina Buchholz reports that, as of June 2025, 37 percent of Republicans trusted the average U.S. institution (out of nine surveyed), while this was only 26 percent for Democrats. A previous low for Democrats in the survey that has been running since 1979 was 30 percent in 2019, the third year of the first Trump administration. Republicans' lowpoint was - also at 26 percent - in 2022 and 2023, the second and third year with President Joe Biden in power. You will find more infographics at Statista Out of the continuously surveyed institutions, Republicans saw the biggest gains in trust for the military, closely followed by Congress (from 4 percent to a still-low 19 percent) and organized religion. Even banks and organized labor earned percentage point increases in the double digits concerning trust levels among Republicans in just the past year. Democrats lost the most trust out of institutions included in the survey in the military, followed by newspapers and organized labor. Interestingly, both groups had no or minimal changes in confidence in the Supreme Court, which 48 percent of Republicans and 16 percent of Democrats trusted most recently. Looking at all institutions surveyed by Gallup, more than 50 percent of Americans trust small business, the military and science. Black Americans exhibited lower levels of trust in U.S. institutions compared to white respondents, according to the release, while both groups were unified by their mistrust in big business and Congress.
