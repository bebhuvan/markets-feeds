    "fullContent": "Key Insights Data center operators are ready to invest in efficient, flexible, and low-cost energy sources that can mitigate stranded asset risks for utilities and keep ratepayer costs in check. Data centers use just 2% of global electricity today. Electricity demand growth from data centers is projected to be less than industrial operations, electric vehicles, household appliances, and space cooling over the next 5 years. Many utilities, specifically in the United States, have a track record of over-forecasting demand, spending billions of dollars building power plants for load that did not materialize. This risk is more salient today given the unpredictability of data center load growth. A range of energy solutions for data centers —  including energy efficiency, flexibility technologies, and fast, modular, and low-cost energy sources — can temper the risks of over-building and high ratepayer costs. These solutions are already the most attractive options for data center operators tod",
