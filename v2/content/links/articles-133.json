    "fullContent": "Chinese Nationals Charged For Allegedly Exporting Microchips To China Without License Authored by Bill Pan via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Two Chinese nationals have been arrested in southern California for allegedly exporting tens of millions of dollars worth of “sensitive microchips” to China in violation of export controls, federal prosecutors said. Semiconductor chips on a circuit board of a computer, in this illustration picture taken on Feb. 25, 2022. Florence Lo/Reuters The U.S. Justice Department on Aug. 5 announced charges against Geng Chuan, 28, of Pasadena, California, and Yang Shiwei, 28, of El Monte, California, under the Export Control Reform Act, a felony offense punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Geng voluntarily surrendered to authorities on Aug. 2, while Yang was arrested earlier on the same day. The lawyers of Geng and Yang could not be reached for comment. According to the Justice Department, between October 2022 and July 2025, Geng and Yang used their El Monte-based company, ALX Solutions, to export advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to Singapore and Malaysia. Both countries are commonly used as transshipment points to conceal China as the ultimate destination. ALX Solutions did not receive payment for the chips from the purported recipients in Southeast Asia, prosecutors said. Instead, it was paid by companies in Hong Kong and China. Payments included a $1 million transaction from a China-based company in January 2024. The Justice Department did not specify the brand or model of chips involved but described them as “the most powerful GPU chips on the market,” explicitly designed for use in self-driving cars, medical diagnosis systems, and other applications powered by artificial intelligence. Such chips require a special export license from the U.S. Commerce Department before they can be legally shipped to China, a permission that ALX Solutions never applied for or obtained, according to prosecutors. Authorities said they found evidence suggesting that Geng and Yang allegedly attempted to evade export controls. “Last week, law enforcement searched ALX Solutions’ office and seized the phones belonging to Geng and Yang that revealed incriminating communications between the defendants, including communications about shipping export-controlled chips to China through Malaysia to evade U.S. export laws,” the Justice Department said in a statement. Geng, a U.S. lawful permanent resident, has been released on a $250,000 bond. Yang, who allegedly overstayed her visa, remains in custody, with a detention hearing scheduled for Aug. 12. Both defendants are scheduled to be arraigned on Sept. 11. In October 2022, the Biden administration imposed a set of export restrictions on advanced semiconductors and manufacturing equipment in an effort to slow the Chinese military’s artificial intelligence development and maintain U.S. leadership in this critical sector. In response, the Chinese Communist Party launched a massive campaign to both accelerate domestic chip innovation and circumvent export controls. In 2023, Chinese telecom giant Huawei unveiled its Mate 60 Pro smartphone, powered by a homegrown seven-nanometer chip—a milestone hailed by Beijing as a symbol of defiance. The phone’s release prompted the Biden administration to reflect on whether its sanctions were compromised. The Trump administration, while still maintaining strict controls on the most advanced semiconductor exports to China, has supported a strategy of allowing sales of lower-end U.S. chips, hoping to foster an ecosystem in which Chinese companies continue to rely on U.S. hardware and do not seek domestically produced alternatives.

But in rural Kansas, houses are selling for a fraction of that—some for less than half the $99,990 cost of a Tesla Cybertruck, according to a new article from Realtor.com. Driving through central-east Kansas, you’ll find quiet towns—Coldwater, Protection, Ashland, and Englewood—where populations have dropped by half since the 1930s. Many were once thriving farming or industrial hubs, but as industry shifted and agriculture became less profitable, residents left in search of more stable communities. Some towns are so small they barely qualify as towns anymore. Englewood, for example, has just 58 residents. Others, like Coldwater, still have over 1,000 people, but, as local real estate agent Jeff Simpson says, “It still gets sleepy pretty quick.” Simpson explains much of the decline is due to aging populations and youth migration: “You see a lot of people aging out of the farming communities, and their children have kind of left—either moved into suburban areas or out of state. So yeah, there’s certainly a little bit of a struggle going on there. We’re seeing homes sell for $50,000 to $85,000—especially old farmsteads that have been broken off larger parcels.” These emptying towns leave behind homes—time capsules of another era. Elizabeth Finkelstein, founder of Cheap Old Homes, notes, “A lot of these towns didn’t have the money to tear down and build new—so these homes survived. They’re like time capsules, filled with pink tile bathrooms and solid oak cabinets. They weren’t designed to impress—they were designed to last. The houses deserve to be preserved.” Listings include a $75,000 five-bedroom in Coldwater, a $40,000 five-bedroom in Ashland, and a $20,000 three-bedroom in Attica. Finkelstein highlights a historic Coldwater bungalow listed under $65,000, praising its durability: “Most of the wood is oak—one of the heaviest woods. These bungalows are so sturdy and built to last. Just to get the cabinetry today, that alone is half the cost of the house.” For buyers shut out of expensive urban markets, she calls these homes a rare opportunity: “No one in this country can afford houses right now—it’s completely ludicrous. Someone who’s done everything right still can’t afford to buy. This is a ticket into a real estate market that seems like a pipe dream. You can get in at a low closing cost and chip away at it slowly over time.” The Realtor.com piece notes that local agents also see potential beyond residential use. Simpson says Kansas’s landscapes are drawing out-of-state recreation seekers: “There’s a lot of out-of-state recreational users—pheasant and quail, the deer, the turkey. There’s a lot of hunting that happens in our area. If you can buy a farm for recreational use and there’s no place to stay, a decent little home nearby will get chewed up pretty quick.” Still, Finkelstein emphasizes that preservation matters: “The houses that get landmarked are usually where something extraordinary happened. But the homes in these towns were where everyday people lived and worked—and that’s actually our real history.” While the future of these “dying” towns is uncertain, revitalization is possible. Realtor.com Senior Economic Research Analyst Hannah Jones says, “‘Dying’ towns face prolonged population decline, disinvestment and economic contraction… While the future may seem grim for these towns, there are some strategies that could help manage their decline. Revitalization can happen, but it requires bringing job opportunities and people back to town, which can lead to investment and growth.” Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 21:20",

US President Donald Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, pushing total duties to 50%, affecting key sectors like pharmaceuticals, textiles, electronics, and gems and jewellery. However, analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Manoranjan Sharma of Infomerics Ratings noted that India’s domestic-driven economy is well-positioned to absorb such shocks. Edelweiss MF’s Trideep Bhattacharya estimated the GDP impact at 0.5–0.7%. Meanwhile, Gift Nifty signals a flat start, and derivatives data shows bullish sentiment returning, with increased put writing at 24,500 levels. The Put-Call Ratio has risen sharply, while India VIX remains low at 11.68, pointing to consolidation rather than panic. Global cues are mixed, with Japan and Taiwan gaining and other Asia-Pacific markets trading lower, adding to the cautious mood.",

    "fullContent": "Why The Pesticide Liability Protection Act Threatens Our Food Supply & The Health Of A Nation Authored by Brooke Miller via The Brownstone Institute, As stewards of the land and providers of our nation’s food supply, farmers and ranchers carry a profound moral obligation - to produce the safest, healthiest, and most nutritious food on the planet. It is not just our livelihood; it is our responsibility to future generations. That is why I am writing today with deep concern regarding the Pesticide Liability Protection Act currently under consideration in Congress. If enacted, this legislation could cause irreparable harm—not just to the health of farmers and ranchers who work directly with these chemicals, but to the broader public who unknowingly consume their residues. The Dangerous Path of Corporate Immunity This bill threatens to open the floodgates for a new wave of pesticides and herbicides engineered by agrochemical giants—products that may be even more toxic than those currently on the market. By shielding these corporations from legal accountability, it removes their last remaining incentive to ensure their chemicals are safe. We have seen this story before. In 1986, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, granting pharmaceutical companies immunity from liability for vaccine-related injuries. The consequences were swift and staggering: a surge in new products, rushed to market without proper safeguards, and a dramatic rise in chronic health conditions in children and adults alike. It was a public health turning point, and not for the better. The parallels to our current situation are striking. Consider the case of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup. Bayer (which acquired Monsanto in 2018) has faced more than 177,000 lawsuits involving the weedkiller and set aside $16 billion to settle cases. Over $11 billion has been paid out in Roundup lawsuit settlements, with individual jury awards reaching as high as $2.1 billion in recent cases. These staggering financial settlements reflect the real human cost of inadequate chemical safety oversight. Even more alarming is the widespread exposure we’re seeing in our most vulnerable population: children. About 87 percent of 650 children tested had detectable levels of glyphosate in their urine, according to CDC analysis. Research shows that children exhibit higher levels of glyphosate in biofluids than adults, and recent studies indicate that higher levels of glyphosate residue in urine in childhood and adolescence were associated with higher risk of liver inflammation and metabolic disorders in young adulthood. To repeat that same mistake with our nation’s food supply would be unconscionable. Why the Pesticide Liability Protection Act Is Unconstitutional The Pesticide Liability Protection Act fundamentally violates several core Constitutional principles that form the bedrock of American jurisprudence: Due Process Violations (5th and 14th Amendments): The Act deprives citizens of their fundamental right to seek redress in courts for injuries caused by defective or dangerous products. This violates substantive due process by eliminating a basic property right—the right to compensation for harm—without adequate justification or alternative remedies. Equal Protection Concerns: The legislation creates an arbitrary distinction between victims of chemical company negligence and all other tort victims. There is no rational basis for why those harmed by pesticides should have fewer legal rights than those harmed by other dangerous products. Separation of Powers: By preemptively shielding an entire industry from judicial review, Congress unconstitutionally interferes with the judiciary’s role in adjudicating disputes and determining liability. This represents legislative overreach into the judicial branch’s constitutional domain. Takings Clause Violations: The Act effectively takes private property—the right to legal recourse—without just compensation, violating the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause. The Supreme Court has consistently held that access to courts is a fundamental right, and any legislation that bars entire categories of claims must meet strict constitutional scrutiny. The Pesticide Liability Protection Act fails this test. A Call for Leadership Therefore, I strongly urge all agricultural organizations—from cattlemen’s associations to farm bureaus, from organic growers to commodity groups—to go on record opposing the Pesticide Liability Protection Act. We must issue public statements and press releases declaring our stance against corporate immunity for chemical manufacturers. This is not just a matter of agricultural policy—it is a matter of public health, environmental integrity, and moral leadership. In addition, I ask that agricultural organizations support Senator Cory Booker’s (D-NJ) proposed legislation, which seeks to hold chemical producers accountable and prioritize the safety of both producers and consumers. This is a rare opportunity to lead on an issue that will define the future of American agriculture. The Choice Before Us The agricultural community stands at a crossroads. We can choose to prioritize short-term convenience and corporate profits, or we can choose to protect the long-term health of our land, our communities, and our food supply. The history of corporate liability shields teaches us a clear lesson: when companies are freed from accountability, public safety inevitably suffers. We cannot allow the same corporate immunity that transformed the pharmaceutical industry to be replicated in agriculture. Let us be remembered not as the generation that turned a blind eye, but as the one that stood firm to protect our land, our people, and our food.

    "fullContent": "China Seizes Opportunity To Praise 'Beloved Brazilian Coffee' While Blasting Trump's 'Bullying' Tariffs China has quickly stepped up to defend Brazil after President Trump slapped the largest South American economy with 50% tariffs on many goods, which took effect Wednesday. China is now looking to benefit by expanding access to its market for Brazilian coffee, which one of the products hit hardest by the new trade restrictions, given the US has long ranked as the world's largest coffee importer. To underscore it is seizing on this new opportunity, China's embassy in Brasília shared a video on X that featured major food delivery company Meituan. \"And the exchange goes both ways: Brazil is also strengthening its footprint in China with its popular coffee,\" the post stated. China has this week granted export authorization to 183 additional Brazilian coffee companies, with five-year permits - something also announced by the embassy. The drink \"is becoming part of everyday life for the Chinese people,\" the embassy proclaimed further. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had declared Tuesday, \"I will call Xi Jinping, I will call Prime Minister Modi. I won’t call Putin, because he can’t travel now. But I will call many presidents.\" He's now getting some of the desired initial rebuke against the US out of his powerful BRICS friends. A Wednesday statement by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing: \"...firmly supports Brazil in safeguarding its national sovereignty and national dignity,\" and \"opposes unwarranted external interference in Brazil’s internal affairs.\" He emphasized that China backs Brazil in \"resisting the bullying imposition of tariff measures\" in a strongly-worded message while vowing to intensify cooperation among Global South countries within the BRICS framework. Wang also in a phone call with a top Lula aid communicated to the Brazilian presidencity that \"using tariffs as a weapon to suppress other countries violates the UN Charter, undermines WTO rules, and is both unpopular and unsustainable.\" China has approved 183 Brazilian coffee firms to export their products to the Chinese market, the Embassy of China in Brazil said on X. The measure took effect on July 30 and is valid for five years. @EmbaixadaChina pic.twitter.com/6vbZG58oT0 — Yicai 第一财经 (@yicaichina) August 5, 2025 Trump has in the recent past voiced criticisms of BRICS, and this week Lula has remained defiant while proposing a BRICS meeting to issue a joint response to US tariffs. Lula has stated that Trump is not \"the emperor of the world\" even if he's trying to act as such. The US has accused Lula of carrying out a \"witch hunt\" against ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently on trial related to corruption and \"coup\" activities related to rejection the election results. Brazil meanwhile may be forced to go looking for other close trade partners. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 20:30",

It’s called 107 Days, because that’s how long everyone had to endure her word salad cackling before Trump won a massive landslide victory. It’s also the same amount of time that she managed to burn through one and a half billion dollars. It also serves as her excuse as to why she lost. The title of the book is a suggestion that she didn’t have long enough to put together a winning strategy. But given she never even coherently explained one policy, one can only assume it would take her years. What do you think will be in her book? Will she finally answer the question ‘how are you different from Joe Biden?’ X user Jarvis has imagined what the content might be like, and it seems pretty accurate.

No. But it's OUR truth, and people need to respect that. — JeffDay (@JeffDay20746) August 5, 2025 Was gonna ask Grok if this is real, but it has that ring of undeniable authenticity. 😀 — Mr. Flake (@MrFlake2) August 5, 2025 As a professional novelist, it is time for me to hang it up, because I will never equal this level of literary brilliance. — Larry Correia (@monsterhunter45) August 5, 2025 Others pointed out that there are giveaways that it’s not hers.
