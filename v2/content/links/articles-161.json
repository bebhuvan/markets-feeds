Sail along a large beaver dam, dancing damselflies, fishing black terns, breeding purple herons and hunting white-tailed eagles. Filmmaker and ecologist Ruben Smit observes the brand new river nature in the Netherlands, his home country, from the water in his canoe. A unique, informative and relaxing experience. The enchanting documentary images take you right through the seasons and let you become one with the man in the canoe. On his journey across the Netherlands, from Lobith on the border with Germany to the North Sea. The Rhine, one of the mighty rivers that made and shaped the European delta. A land of water. The rivers that cut through the Netherlands are so much more than just containers of water. The river ecosystem is full of life, with sunsets and sunrises that make your heart skip a beat and with a surprise behind every reed bed. Where human hands have worked hard; river bypasses, floodplains",
