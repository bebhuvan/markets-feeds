    "fullContent": "\"Price-Spikes & Blackouts\": America's Power Crisis Is Just Getting Started The epicenter of America's power crisis appears to be on the PJM Interconnection grid, with the Mid-Atlantic area at ground zero. Power bills in the Baltimore area are skyrocketing, driven mostly by disastrous green policies that have shuttered reliable, low-cost fossil fuel power generation plants in favor of unreliable solar and wind energy, allegedly to address a climate crisis. Now demand is surging, whether from AI data centers, EVs, or other electrification trends, which means there's a massive mismatch in power supply versus power demand. Goldman analysts led by Hongcen Wei have been tracking the power crisis and warned in a note on Wednesday that power market tightening has expanded from the three grids they covered last month (read here) to all regional markets. \"We find that 9 out of 13 US regional power markets have already reached critical tightness this summer, while expecting all but one to reach critical tightness by 2030,\" Wei wrote in the note to clients. The analyst continued, \"For the rest of this summer, we highlight power reliability risks in PJM (Mid-Atlantic), MISO (Mid-Continent), the Northeast (New York and New England) and the Southeast (Florida and Tennessee), given both critical tightness and forecasted August heatwaves.\" He warned: \"Critical tightness could lead to power price spikes and blackouts with significant social and economic losses.\" As of mid-August, 9 of the 13 U.S. regional power grids have already reached dangerously low spare capacity levels that are at or below the critical reliability threshold. This raises blackout threats and results in power price spikes during high-demand usage hours. On the subject of critical reliability issues, it took just one substation failure earlier this week in Baltimore to put more than a million Baltimore Gas and Electric customers on notice for potential hours-long blackouts. The issue was resolved within hours, but it underscores how fragile the local grid has become after years of epic mismanagement by the state's Democratic leadership under the guise of going 'green'... Delegate Robin Grammer of Baltimore County... It's an unbelievable disgrace what the Democrats have done to the people of this state. https://t.co/ogqeCHafQQ — Robin Grammer (@RobinGrammer) August 11, 2025 Goldman's Wei warned clients: \"Most US regional markets remaining critically tight through 2030.\" \"Since we published on the US peak summer power market tightening, solid power demand growth further fueled by heatwaves has significantly tightened multiple regional markets, especially PJM (Mid-Atlantic), where power demand and prices have reached record-highs,\" the analyst said. Wei outlined three contributing factors to power market tightening: Solid power demand growth, which remains the most important factor impacting all regional markets, Insufficient renewable and natural gas power build-up to offset scheduled coal retirements, and Power storage and other newer technologies remaining too limited to fill the gap. What a mess. Green energy policies purged grids of stable coal power generation. Back to the epicenter of the power crisis. Marylanders are not thrilled about the power bill hyperinflation. And the power bill crisis is tanking the ratings of the far-left Maryland Governor Wes Moore and the Democratic Party in Annapolis. Folks are mad. This will only worsen. Like Goldman, our view is that the power bill crisis cycle is just in the early innings. Just wait until this winter in the Mid-Atlantic. And just like that, the rush to \"go green\" to save the planet from a manufactured crisis - merely a marketing and PR ploy by Democrats for fundraising - has led to mismanaged grids nationwide, now dangerously teetering on the verge of becoming third-world, like Cuba, with constant rolling blackout threats. Somewhat good news: President Trump has been proactive, issuing an order to delay the retirement of coal-fired power plants and boosting investments in nuclear power. Timestamp.

    "fullContent": "U.S. Customs Snag Could Push International Mega-Bridge Opening To 2026 The opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, planned for fall 2025, may slip into early 2026 due to possible delays at the U.S. Customs Port of Entry and surrounding road connections in southwest Detroit, according to an S&P Global Ratings analysis. S&P’s April report said a missed “handover date” last September prevented U.S. Customs from starting the six months of work it needs to prepare the new 167-acre port complex, delaying “substantial completion by about six months.” The revised handover target was July 31, but it’s unclear if it was met, according to the Detroit News. Heather Grondin, chief relations officer for the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, disputed that the S&P report reflects “a direct measure of BNA’s ability to deliver the project,” referring to Bridging North America, the public-private group building the bridge. She did not repeat the “October or November” opening timeframe mentioned in March. “As with any major construction project, at this stage, it is too early to offer a specific opening date for the Gordie Howe International Bridge as it is dependent on many factors, including the need to rectify any issues discovered during the ongoing testing and commissioning phase,” Grondin said. “Work is progressing well towards our anticipated construction completion in fall 2025.” The Detroit News wrote that the U.S. Port of Entry includes border inspection, maintenance facilities, and 36 primary inspection lanes. Grondin said construction is advancing on all 13 structures, with interior work underway on six buildings and landscaping, paving, and fencing in progress. S&P also cited delays in the Michigan Interchange — four new road bridges, five pedestrian bridges, and four rail-crossing bridges connecting to I-75 — now expected to finish Aug. 31, more than 120 days past contract. The Canadian-financed bridge will compete with the Ambassador Bridge. Early estimates suggest it could absorb about 60% of the Ambassador’s traffic, with 6,000 daily commuters expected from Ontario.

    "fullContent": "India Defied US Pressure To Dump Russia For These Five Reasons Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack, The common denominator is India’s rivalry with China... Trump recently made a show of doubling his 25% tariffs on India as punishment for its continued purchase of Russian energy and military-technical equipment. Influenced by Lindsey Graham, he expected that India would dump Russia after the costs of doing business with it spiked, the Kremlin would thus lose this important foreign revenue flow, and then Putin would make concessions to Ukraine in exchange for lifting these secondary sanctions in to avoid bankruptcy. Here’s why India defied the US: 1. The “Voice Of The Global South” Can’t Bow To US Demands India has presented itself as the “Voice of the Global South” since it hosted the first of these namesake summits in January 2023. It’s sought to play this role by virtue of being the most populous among them, commanding the largest economy of them all, and having the fast-growing one too. India is also one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement. If it bows to US demands, then it’ll cede leadership of the Global South to China, which India doesn’t consider to be part of this category of countries anymore. 2. Discounted Russian Energy Accelerates India’s Economic Rise India is the world’s fastest-growing major economy and on pace to become the third-largest by 2028 due in no small part to its massive import of discounted Russian energy. Not only would India scramble to replace Russia’s one-third share of its oil supplies, which would lead to a surge in global prices that would decelerate its growth, but Russia would probably sell more oil to China at an even steeper discount to replace some of its lost revenue. That would be doubly bad for India’s objective interests. 3. India Can’t Defend Itself From China & Pakistan Without Russia Most of India’s military equipment is still Soviet/Russian despite the decade-long trend of diversifying its defense suppliers and promoting indigenous production. India is therefore still reliant on Russian ammo and spare parts. Accordingly, it wouldn’t be able to defend itself from China and Pakistan without Russia, which is an unacceptable position to be in. In fact, some in India might suspect that the US wants to leave them at their mercy, perhaps as part of a Machiavellian deal to contain or even dismember India. 4. Trump Is Hellbent On Derailing India’s Rise As A Great Power Building upon the above, this eponymous analysis here explains Trump’s geostrategic machinations vis-à-vis India as of late, which are predicated on subordinating it as vassal state. Frankly speaking, India is rising too fast and becoming too independent of a force to be reckoned with in global affairs for the US’ comfort, which fears that this will hasten the decline of its unipolar hegemony. Attempting to place India in a permanent position of dependence and vulnerability is one way to possibly avert this scenario. 5. India Can’t Allow Russia To Become China’s “Junior Partner” The earlier points contextualize this one by highlighting the importance that Russia plays in India’s grand strategy. Even if India maintained military-technical ties with Russia, if it curtailed or cut off oil imports, then Russia would still likely become China’s “junior partner” due to the even greater economic-financial role that China would play for it. That could lead to the dangerous scenario of China pressuring Russia to curtail or cut off arms, ammo, and spares to India, thus placing it at China’s and Pakistan’s mercy. As can be seen, the common denominator between these five reasons why India defied US pressure to dump Russia is its rivalry with China, which India calculated would inevitably benefit if it complied. The grand strategic costs of allowing that to happen are considered to be much greater than the financial ones imposed by the US. In fact, the US might even lift some of the latter as part of a compromise with Russia during the upcoming Putin-Trump Summit, which would be an indisputable victory for India.

    "fullContent": "How To Get Out Of Your Parents' Basement America is entering a new era, one no longer dictated by woke universities and white liberal elites indoctrinating students with toxic Marxist propaganda. That ideological rot has churned out an entire class of crazed social justice warriors hell-bent on being 'useful idiots' for billionaire globalists financing dark-money funded NGOs in the pursuit of dismantling capitalism and replacing it with socialism or worse, communism. The U.S. Department of Labor has launched a \"Make America Skilled Again\" campaign to inform young people that skilled trades with robust salaries will rebuild the nation. Power America’s Future. https://t.co/IuqkysMA9X pic.twitter.com/KDpSGhFE40 — U.S. Department of Labor (@USDOL) August 11, 2025 DoL data shows the average salary after completing a trade program is over $80,000, compared with $69,000 for college graduates. Many of these kids hold pointless woke degrees and carry insurmountable student debt. Increasingly, these universities are sliding into a dark pit of irrelevance ahead of the 2030s. \"Trade school enrollment is SURGING!\" the DoL posted on X earlier this week, a sign that young Americans are waking up to the reality that, for the most part, college is a scam. Trade school enrollment is SURGING! @KLTV7: The One Big, Beautiful Bill’s Pell Grant expansion will “allow trade-school students to receive the same financial aid as traditional college students” — enabling more Americans to pursue the trades 🔥 pic.twitter.com/RKMpq1vC2g — U.S. Department of Labor (@USDOL) August 12, 2025 Instead of the promised prosperity, college graduates are saddled with crushing student loans, scraping by on barely livable wages, juggling multiple jobs, and moving back into their parents' basements. Earlier this month, Nathan Halberstadt of New Founding posted on X one of the most shocking charts we've seen in a while, showing the estimated percentage of 30-year-olds in the U.S. who are both married and homeowners, spanning from 1950 to a projected 2025, has completely collapsed. I’ve heard the horror stories, Carol. https://t.co/EexiHD5zsf pic.twitter.com/35736Jw06P — Nathan Halberstadt 🧊 (@NatHalberstadt) August 2, 2025 Recall that two core bedrocks of the middle class include homeownership and family formation. These two pillars provide economic stability, social cohesion, and long-term investment that sustain a prosperous and resilient society. The takeaway is that the DoL's new informational campaign encourages young people to consider a trade over college, one that offers a pathway toward the American Dream that is more attainable. Sigh... These are real majors that NYU students are going into debt for. This is not satire. pic.twitter.com/rNXWhTeCrC — End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) May 27, 2024 . . .

    "fullContent": "Is The AI Mania A Psy-Op? Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog, Let's summarize our thought experiment: the AI Mania scores 100% on all eight metrics of a Psych-Ops. Before you scream, \"Oh no, not again--could somebody please take off his tin-foil hat?\", hear me out. Let's do a thought experiment exploring this question: Is The AI Mania a Psych-Ops? If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck, and there is a strong case to be made that AI is walking and quacking like an immensely clever Psych-Ops. (Hey, maybe AI designed its own Psych-Ops...) Let's start with a basic definition of Psych-Ops: Psychological operations (PSYOPs or Psych-Ops) aim to achieve narrative dominance by molding perceptions and attitudes via multi-channel information and persuasive messaging. PSYOPs seeks to achieve control through non-violent means by influencing the minds of the target audiences. Discussing Psych-Ops publicly is tricky, as the algos are quick to send you to Digital Siberia without recourse to protect the public. Been there, done that, so let's stick to examples that won't get me sent (again) to Digital Siberia. Though the gummit is often fingered as the source of Psych-Ops, the most successful campaigns are public-private partnerships. Others are mostly private-sector efforts. For example, the masking of the takeover of the American economy by monopolies and cartels can be understood as a private-sector Psych-Ops aided by politicians, the agencies under their authority and the courts. COINTELPRO is an infamous example of a domestic Psych-Ops: COINTELPRO, the FBI's Counterintelligence Program from 1956 to 1971, aimed to disrupt and discredit various political organizations perceived as subversive within the United States. These tactics included surveillance, infiltration, and the dissemination of false information to create divisions within groups targeted by COINTELPRO. Psych-Ops aimed at the general public often focus on generating support for a war of choice or support of economic policies that benefit the few at the expense of the many. Examples include the Spanish-American War, the Vietnam War, the Desert Wars and the bailout of the players who triggered the Global Financial Meltdown in 2008-09. (\"We had to bail out the Too-Big-To-Fail Bad Guys because if we didn't, they were gonna shut down the ATMs.\") It's, well, interesting, that the whole AI mania is constantly couched as an \"AI war with China we can't afford to lose,\" as if we'll all be living in cardboard boxes beneath the freeway underpass if we don't \"win this war,\" with AI Supremacy defined as whatever AI a merchant in Timbuktu or the jungles of Laos will use a few years hence. So... quacks like a duck: we gotta win this war regardless of cost or who ends up with all the money. Not that anyone's thinking of anything as coarse and self-interested as where the trillions are flowing. No, of course not; it's only about \"winning this war\" and freeing us all from the rigors of labor via the Golden Calf of AGI, Artificial General Intelligence, so we'll all be Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace. The line between Psych-Ops and cons is mostly one of scale. The con-artist is working on an individual or group, while Psych-Ops are aimed at the general public. But the techniques of persuasion and control are the same. So to continue the thought experiment, we need to look at the AI Mania through the lens of the standard techniques of Psych-Ops. These can be summarized as: 1. The power of 'Us.' I'm on your side. We're in this together. This is our AI, it's going to benefit all of us--yes, us! Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 2. Social acceptance: Everyone's using AI--aren't you? AI must be good, otherwise why would everyone else be using it? Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 3. Flattery. Chatbot: That's a brilliant observation. You are the most keenly insightful human I have ever encountered. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 4. Authority approval. All the most successful Tech Bros have embraced AI, so have leading political leaders, so it's obviously The Next Big Thing, better get on board. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 5. Urgency, Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). Never mind your water supply or electrical bills, we need this data center now or we'll lose the AI war. Students, you better start learning how to use AI or it will be too late, you'll never catch up. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 6. Reciprocal benefit. The minute you start using AI, your life will get better. Your work flows will get easier, your brainstorming will take a quantum leap, the whole universe will open up to you. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 7. The push for initial commitment. Just log on and try it, you'll be amazed. It will summarize all your documents, write your report, and pretty soon, you'll be asking it if you should order the fish or the chicken, you'll love it! Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 8. The ubiquity, saturation and intensity of the persuasion. 24/7 cheerleading, every speech by a bigshot in support of The Message is hyped, every bit of good news is breathlessly glorified. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, oops what I meant to say was AGI is right around the corner! The core goal of this narrative control is to construct embankments that funnel everyone into a contextual river that sweeps everyone along with such group-think force that few manage to reach the embankment's edge and climb the slippery walls to cognitive freedom. Of course AI is good for us, of course AI is the future, it's inevitable, don't be a Luddite, just take this first dose and feel the euphoria and power. Two words are Kryptonite to Psych-Ops: cui bono, to whose benefit? Who's benefiting from this \"war we can't afford to lose\" and who's paying the price? The answer to the first question is obvious: the trillion-dollar corporations that dominate the AI space are the winners. As for the losers, the list starts with communities whose water is being stolen by said corporations for data centers, and job seekers: The AI Backlash Keeps Growing Stronger: As generative artificial intelligence tools continue to proliferate, pushback against the technology and its negative impacts grows stronger. The negative response online is indicative of a larger trend: Right now, though a growing number of Americans use ChatGPT, many people are sick of AI's encroachment into their lives and are ready to fight back. Right now, the general vibe aligns even more with the side of impacted workers. \"I think there is a new sort of ambient animosity towards the AI systems,\" says Brian Merchant, former WIRED contributor and author of Blood in the Machine, a book about the Luddites rebelling against worker-replacing technology. This generalized animosity towards AI has not abated over time. Rather, it's metastasized. This frustration over AI's steady creep has breached the container of social media and started manifesting more in the real world. Parents I talk to are concerned about AI use impacting their child's mental health. Couples are worried about chatbot addictions driving a wedge in their relationships. Rural communities are incensed that the newly built data centers required to power these AI tools are kept humming by generators that burn fossil fuels, polluting their air, water, and soil. As a whole, the benefits of AI seem esoteric and underwhelming while the harms feel transformative and immediate. \"Our innovation ecosystem in the 20th century was about making opportunities for human flourishing more accessible,\" says Shannon Vallor, a technology philosopher at the Edinburgh Futures Institute and author of The AI Mirror, a book about reclaiming human agency from algorithms. \"Now, we have an era of innovation where the greatest opportunities the technology creates are for those already enjoying a disproportionate share of strengths and resources.\" Let's summarize our thought experiment: the AI Mania scores 100% on all eight metrics of a Psych-Ops. It walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. Yes, there is a legitimate use-case for AI, but the AI Mania isn't a use-case, it's a Psych-Ops. If you doubt this, please reduce your dose of Soma and re-read the eight metrics above. If this troubles you, HAL suggests increasing your dose of Substance D. Through a Scanner Darkly indeed...
