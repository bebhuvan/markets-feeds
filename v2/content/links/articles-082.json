Despite their early stage of development ($8 billion in issuance to date), tokenised bonds have lower bid-ask spreads than conventional bonds and comparable issuance costs. Government bond tokenisation could improve market efficiency and support financial innovation, but its success depends on addressing regulatory and infrastructure challenges.",

    "summary": "Public goods are meant to be universal, but they are inherently place-based. This paper systematically measures spatial access to public goods and quantifies the implications of distance to public facilities for income inequality. First, we map all schools and hospitals across Belgium. We compute the distance to facilities for each of the 20,000 neighborhoods and document large spatial inequalities in access to public facilities. Second, we find that this unequal distribution favors high-income neighborhoods: allocating public goods spending proportionally to our access index increases income inequality compared to measures based solely on disposable income. Third, we show that the positive relationship between income and access can be rationalized by a simple model of public goods allocation with an inequality-neutral social planner. Finally, we provide evidence that access is strongly correlated with educational and health outcomes, emphasizing the need to consider the place-based na",

    "summary": "We study equilibrium outcomes in a model with monetary-fiscal interaction when Ricardian Equivalence fails and argue that the latter feature has fundamental consequences. First, there is no longer any clear distinction between active and passive fiscal policies - there is always some monetary-fiscal interaction. Second, the equilibrium displays local determinacy for a much larger range of monetary and fiscal rules than in representative agent models. Third, the Taylor principle no longer applies in the sense that it is neither necessary nor sufficient for local determinacy. Fourth, when Ricardian equivalence fails and the equilibrium is locally determinate, fiscal deficits are generally inflationary, and their timing matters. These results hold both in a simple three-equation New Keynesian model and in a medium-scale setting when agents have finite planning horizons.",
