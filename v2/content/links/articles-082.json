    "fullContent": "Bolsonaro Placed Under House Arrest By US-Sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court Head Late Monday there's been more escalation in the Trump-Brazil standoff over the legal fate of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The country's top justices have ordered him to be put under house arrest. The Supreme Court, which is still in the process of ruling on the Bolsonaro case - as he's accused of an alleged coup attempt against his leftist rival President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva - has now said he has defied a court order banning Bolsonaro from social media. Jair Bolsonaro and justice Alexandre de Moraes. source: Secom/TSE They say he's attacking the nation's institutions while still on trial, and after he's already wearing a ankle monitoring brace. Brazil has faced US sanctions (targeting among others Bolsonaro's main rival and man driving what Trump has called a \"witch hunt\" - Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes) as well as the highest tariff rates in the world. Moraes himself issued the house arrest order, despite now being specifically targeted by the Trump administration. \"Moraes said Bolsonaro had violated precautionary measures imposed by the court restricting the former president’s social media usage and political messaging,\" according to Al Jazeera. Moraes has said that Bolsonaro, who was president of the country between 2019 and 2022, has spread messages with \"a clear content of encouragement and instigation to attacks against the Supreme Court and a blatant support for foreign intervention in the Brazilian Judiciary.\" Trump's recent heightened intervention has added fuel to the fire, and the standoff has intensified, with the Lula government so far having refused to bend the knee. Bolsonaro's family members have also been very vocal, often acting as 'messenger' - for example hailing Trump's punitive actions targeting the Supreme Court and Lula officials. Brazilians are against the tyranny of Alexandre de Moreas and Lula. Down with the PT/STF regime pic.twitter.com/LeOaiVwzLb — Direita Cristã Floripa (@direcrisflop) August 4, 2025 Sunday saw tens of thousands of Bolsonaro supporters in the streets, in the major cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. They, with Trump, want a full pardon for Bolsonaro and his officials which have been persecuted with him. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 20:30",

US President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a reception with Republican members of Congress at the White House on July 22, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One, Trump said that a distribution of dividends to selected U.S. households is possible, even as the government works to pay down the national debt. “We have a lot of money coming in, much more money than the country has ever seen, by hundreds of billions of dollars,” he said. “There could be a distribution for dividends to the people of our country. I would say for people that would be middle-income people and lower-income people, we could do a dividend.” He also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to lower drug prices, in line with his May 12 executive order that requires drug manufacturers to offer American consumers “the most-favored-nation lowest price” for prescription drugs. “We‘ll be dropping drug prices, it will start over the next two to three months, by 1,200, 1,300 and even 1,400 percent,” he said. “We will pay as low as the lowest nation in the world.” Trump did not specify the potential amount of dividends he could distribute. The U.S. government collected $28 billion in tariff revenues in July, marking a record monthly high and bringing the total revenue for the fiscal year to more than $151 billion, according to Treasury data. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told last month’s cabinet meeting that tariff collections could reach $300 billion by the end of the year, as a result of Trump’s trade campaign. Trump imposed a 10 percent baseline tariff on nearly all U.S. trading partners in April, along with reciprocal tariffs that vary depending on their trade barriers with the United States, as part of an effort to address trade deficits. He later implemented a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs, before extending the reprieve to Aug. 1 to allow time for negotiations. The president signed an executive order on July 31 imposing reciprocal tariffs of between 10 percent and 41 percent on more than 60 U.S. trading partners. The new tariff rates, which are set to take effect on Aug. 7, were determined based on whether each nation has reached an agreement with the United States and the nature of those agreements. In his order, Trump stated that some trading partners have agreed to or are close to making “meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States,” while others have proposed terms that he thinks fail to adequately address trade imbalances or “align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters.” “There are also some trading partners that have failed to engage in negotiations with the United States or to take adequate steps to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters,” the order stated. The Trump administration is working on a trade deal with China, which is subject to an extended deadline through Aug. 12, following a May 12 agreement in which the two largest economies agreed to lower tariffs and roll back certain trade restrictions for 90 days.

    "fullContent": "China's Grip On Critical Minerals Disrupts U.S. Defense Supply Chain In 2023, Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes warned that Beijing effectively has the US military's supply chain by the balls, thanks to America's reliance on rare earths and other materials which either come from, or are processed in, China. F-35 Lightning II jet (Adobe Stock) According to Hayes, Raytheon has \"several thousand suppliers in China,\" because of which \"decoupling ... is impossible.\" \"We can de-risk but not decouple,\" he told the Financial Times, adding that he thinks this is the case \"for everybody.\" \"Think about the $500bn of trade that goes from China to the US every year. More than 95 per cent of rare earth materials or metals come from, or are processed in, China. There is no alternative,\" he said. Fast forward two years later - and China’s recent curbs on the export of critical minerals are rippling through the U.S. defense supply chain, slowing production schedules and sending manufacturers on a global search for scarce materials needed in everything from munitions to fighter jets. (And of course, last month ZeroHedge premium subs were treated to \"The Coming Rare Earth Revolution And How To Profit\" - full of names that have exploded higher since publication...) In short, amid a surge in U.S.-China trade tensions earlier this year, Beijing tightened its control over rare earth exports. Those shipments resumed after the Trump administration reached a set of trade concessions in June, however China has kept a firm hold on materials destined for defense use. Accounting for roughly 90 percent of the world’s rare earth output - and dominating the supply of other strategic minerals - China has also barred the sale of germanium, gallium and antimony to the United States since December. The three metals are essential for bullet hardening, night-vision optics and other military applications, the WSJ reports. A Ukrainian soldier using night-vision goggles during a mission in 2023. Photo: Felipe Dana/AP Some contractors warn that their reserves are running dangerously low. Bill Lynn, chief executive of Leonardo DRS, said Wednesday that his company’s supply of germanium has fallen to “safety stock” levels. The metal is used in infrared sensors for missiles and other systems. “In order to sustain timely product deliveries, material flow must improve in the second half” of 2025, he told investors. Leonardo DRS, a U.S. subsidiary of Italy’s Leonardo, is exploring alternative suppliers and possible substitutes. For others, the bottleneck has already meant missed deadlines. One drone-parts maker supplying the U.S. military delayed orders by as much as two months while hunting for non-Chinese sources of magnets, which are produced from rare earth elements. Traders say prices for some materials have multiplied several times over; samarium, used in high-temperature magnets for jet engines, has been offered at 60 times its typical price. The Pentagon has instructed defense contractors to phase out magnets containing Chinese minerals by 2027. While some firms have stockpiled magnets, most carry only months of supply for other critical materials. Smaller drone manufacturers — often startups with limited resources — are considered especially exposed. Dak Hardwick, vice president of international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, said the problem is discussed constantly within the industry. “I can tell you…we talk about this daily and our companies talk about it daily,” he said. A recent analysis by defense software firm Govini found that more than 80,000 components used in U.S. weapons systems contain minerals now under Chinese export controls. Nearly all such supply chains depend on at least one Chinese source. Western buyers say Chinese authorities have begun demanding detailed disclosures - including images of products and production lines - before approving shipments. In May, New Hampshire-based ePropelled received such requests from a Chinese magnet supplier, along with a list of questions about its customers and assurances the magnets would not be used for military purposes. “Of course we are not going to provide the Chinese government with that information,” said Chris Thompson, the firm’s vice president of global sales. When the company refused, shipments stopped, extending delivery times to twice their usual length. The firm turned to suppliers in the United States, Europe, Japan and Taiwan, as well as to emerging producers Vulcan Elements in North Carolina and USA Rare Earth in Oklahoma. Those new sources are not expected to deliver until later this year and will need to develop non-Chinese supply chains of their own. Washington has begun to respond. The Pentagon has invested in expanding domestic output, including a $14 million grant last year to a Canadian firm producing germanium substrates for defense satellites and a $400 million stake in MP Materials, which operates the largest rare-earth mine in the Americas. On an earnings call, Lockheed Martin CEO James Taiclet described the MP Materials deal as “groundbreaking” for securing magnets needed in F-35 fighters and cruise missiles. Nicholas Myers, CEO of Massachusetts-based Phoenix Tailings, said large defense companies are now moving aggressively to secure their own mineral supplies. “They recognize that they’re just not going to get the magnets… unless they get involved,” he said. Beijing’s hard line is also affecting shipments in transit. Earlier this year, United States Antimony Corporation attempted to route 55 metric tons of Australian-mined antimony to its Mexican smelter via the Chinese port of Ningbo, a process it had used before without incident. In April, Chinese customs officials held the cargo for three months, eventually releasing it only on the condition it be returned to Australia. When it arrived, company CEO Gary Evans said the seals had been broken. “The shipping company, everyone who was involved, they’d never seen this happen before,” he said.

Comgend Polynésie Française—the national police force of French Polynesia—has announced that it has seized a “historic” quantity of drugs with a total street value of €331 million (US$382.66 million) from a yacht caught in the Marquesas Islands, about 1,400 kilometres north of Tahiti. After towing it to Pape'ete, the capital of Tahiti, and dismantling it, over 700 kilograms of drugs were found concealed in the boat’s structure. In total, 1,646.8 kilograms of cocaine and 232.4 kilograms of methamphetamine were seized from the boat. They also discovered 11 Glock semi‑automatic pistols and 24 magazines. Shipment Believed to be Bound For Australia The yacht was believed to have left Mexico and to be headed to Australia via Tonga. The three men onboard, a German skipper and two Dutch nationals, remain in custody, local Public Prosecutor Solène Belaouar said in a statement on Aug. 2. The head of French Polynesia’s Customs Department, Serge Puccetti, told local media the shipment was not destined for French Polynesia. He said French authorities regularly share intelligence with law enforcement agencies in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Echoing Patel’s warning, he said the Pacific is now a major transit area between narcotic production in South America and users in Australia, which has emerged as a major market, as well as to New Zealand and Asia. Organised crime syndicates from Southeast Asia are also using the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea, as transit points to ship opium-based drugs and methamphetamines to the U.S. market. Smugglers were now using all kinds of transport modes: air, sea, onboard containers, and sailboats, Puccetti said. “On each of these vectors, we are vigilant,” he said. New Caledonia’s Divisional Head of Customs, Hervé Matho, told local media, “In terms of cocaine consumption, the U.S. market is now saturated. That’s why traffickers are searching for new markets, [in] Europe and, in the Pacific region, Australia and New Zealand.” Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 19:15",

    "fullContent": "Hey Canada, Your Failed Wildfire Management Is Poisoning America's Skies Representative John James, a Republican from Michigan, penned a blistering letter to Canadian leaders, warning their out-of-control wildfires are \"poisoning the air and threatening the health of millions across Michigan and the Midwest.\" Now, that toxic smoke is pouring into the Northeast, and soon, into New York City. Just when many thought Justin Trudeau's leadership was disastrous, the beginning of the globalist Mark Carney era suggests things can and will likely get even worse. Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record. Government data shows 4,00 wildfires have been recorded so far this year. \"Despite the clear public health crisis, Canadian officials have shown alarming disregard,\" Rep. James wrote in a press release, informing his constituents about the letter he fired off to Canadian leaders, urging immediate action to contain the growing wildfire crisis that is poisoning America's air. If Canada's globalist 'green' leaders actually cared about the planet, they would have practiced proper forest management. But they didn't, and they failed miserably. Rep. James noted that the 2023 wildfire season in Canada was equivalent to \"running over 500 million cars for a full year.\" At the moment, smoke from 740 Canadian wildfires is spreading south and degrading air quality over a massive stretch of North America. New York City is under air-quality alerts... \"This lack of urgency undermines decades of cross-border cooperation and damages the U.S.—Canada relationship,\" Rep. James said. The bigger question is whether these forest fires are truly natural ... or part of a broader form of hybrid warfare. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 18:50",
