These benefits are clearly outlined on ICE's official website. https://t.co/nZkBEj3GGi pic.twitter.com/N7cFpDhb7W — Homeland Security (@DHSgov) August 5, 2025 Text from the website states: \"America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out. You do not need an undergraduate degree.\" Democrats are going insane about ICE's messaging to bolster its forces - because just a few short years ago, these far-left lawmakers were trying to abolish the agency while facilitating the invasion of criminal illegal aliens. 2018. AOC mentions Kamala Harris as a supporter of her radical agenda, which at the time included abolishing ICE. Now Kamala is promising to add more agents and secure the border. Kamala is not a leader.
