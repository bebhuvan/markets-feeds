However, <strong>Massie's opposition to US involvement in Israel's war seemed to have been the last straw</strong>.

Speaking to reporters after the raid, Ben Gvir said: <strong>\"The Temple Mount is for the Jews, and we will remain here forever.\"</strong></p> <p>Since becoming a minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, Ben Gvir has led at least 11 assaults on the mosque. Meanwhile, several other far-right politicians have <strong>advocated for the destruction of Al-Aqsa and the construction of a temple where they claim Jewish temples once stood</strong>.</p> <p>Among the hundreds of people to take part in Sunday's raid was right-wing Likud lawmaker Amit Halevi, who has repeatedly advocated for Israel to destroy all water, food and energy sources in Gaza.</p> <p>In June 2023, he tabled a bill that would divide Al-Aqsa Mosque between Muslims and Jews, a plan that would see shared access from the courtyard of the Dome of the Rock to the end of the northern border of Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p> <p>Palestinians fear that the incursions at Al-Aqsa, which have intensified since Israel went to war on Gaza in October 2023, are laying the groundwork for the mosque to be divided similar to how the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron was in the 1990s.</p> <p>Muslims currently have limited access to that site, and just last month, Israel transferred the authority of the mosque from the Palestinian-run Hebron municipality to a settler council.</p> <p>Aouni Bazbaz, the director of international affairs at the Islamic Waqf, the organisation that administers Al-Aqsa Mosque, described Sunday's raid as \"painful and regrettable\", telling MEE that it was a threat to the \"historical status quo and an incitement to violence\".</p> <p>\"There were terrifying numbers of people [Israeli settlers] present and some were important figures,\" he said. \"This was part of a project. The extreme religious right seeks to undermine the status quo and to clearly follow the example of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.</p> <p>\"There are no worshippers here right now, the place is empty, the Old City is empty. <strong>It's a military barracks</strong>,\" he added.</p> <p>The Jerusalem Governorate also decried the raid, and appealed to the international community, in particular Muslim states, \"to take immediate action\".</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir sparked fresh outrage today after performing Talmudic rituals inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, accompanied by an associate who carried out the “epic prostration”, a form of Jewish worship explicitly prohibited at the site <a href=\"https://t.co/pv3aKSaJvc\">pic.twitter.com/pv3aKSaJvc</a></p> — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MiddleEastEye/status/1951940076071473266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>\"What happened today is not just a traditional incursion.

The Democrats and their NGO machine have lost not just the narrative but are drifting deeper into irrelevance. </p> <p>50501 (\"50 Protests, 50 States, 1 Movement\") is part of the <strong>permanent protest-industrial complex</strong> and was behind the underwhelming demonstrations this weekend. The group's mission is to organize large-scale, <strong>nationwide color revolution-style operations against President Trump</strong>, including these previous events:</p> <ul><li> <p><em>February 5: Anti-Trump kickoff rallies </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>February 17 (Presidents' Day): \"No Kings on Presidents Day\"</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>March 4: Third round of demonstrations</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>April 5: \"Hands Off\" protests, among the largest anti-Trump protests </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>June 14: \"No Kings\"</em></p> </li> </ul><p><strong>Each of the nationwide protests listed above has failed to generate enough momentum</strong> to shift public opinion and move the polls. The dark-money-funded NGOs behind the permanent protest-industrial complex have grown increasingly frustrated; so much so that they reportedly offered $20 million to a 'rent-a-protester' firm. </p> <p>Last month, Adam Swart, CEO of an activist group called \"Crowds on Demand\", called out one unnamed leftist entity ...</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"</em><strong><em>We had to reject an offer worth around $20 million for nationwide, large-scale demonstrations across the country. Personally, I don't think it's effective. I'm rejecting the contract not because I don't want the business, but because, frankly, this is going to be ineffective and make us all look bad</em></strong><em>.\"</em></p> </blockquote> <p>\"One of the more <strong>bizarre highlights of this past weekend's failed protest operation was a 50501 staffer setting up what appeared to be a \"smash room\" for deranged white leftists </strong>in the parking lot of a retail center in Tim Walz's state.</p> <p>\"After smashing a watermelon, one attendee screamed \"<strong>REVOLUTION</strong>\" stating that the experience was \"cathartic\" and left her shaking,\" journalist Savanah Hernandez wrote on X. </p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Liberals in Minnesota are currently smashing watermelons and TVs to help expel their “rage” against the Trump admin.<br /><br /> After smashing a watermelon, one attendee screamed “REVOLUTION” stating that the experience was “cathartic” and left her shaking: <a href=\"https://t.co/9kpKnwojZ0\">pic.twitter.com/9kpKnwojZ0</a></p> — Savanah Hernandez (@sav_says_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sav_says_/status/1951704264184586728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>Hernandez said, \"<strong>Live look at the full event, which includes a scream tent, smash room and about 80 senior citizens</strong>.\"</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Live look at the full event, which includes a scream tent, smash room and about 80 senior citizens <a href=\"https://t.co/bItY4htp3J\">https://t.co/bItY4htp3J</a></p> — Savanah Hernandez (@sav_says_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sav_says_/status/1951704731606204574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p><strong>Related:</strong></p> <ul><li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/watch-rent-protester-ceo-rejects-20-million-contract-stage-anti-trump-protests\">Watch: Rent-A-Protester CEO Rejects $20 Million Contract To Stage Anti-Trump Protests</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/dark-money-network-funneled-millions-no-kings-nationwide-color-revolution-operation\">Dark-Money Network Funneled Millions Into 'No Kings' Nationwide Color Revolution Operation</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/watch-live-house-doge-subcommittee-exposes-public-funds-private-agendas-ngos-gone-wild\">House DOGE Subcommittee Exposes \"Public Funds, Private Agendas: NGOs Gone Wild\"</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/communist-billionaire-accused-funding-anti-ice-riots-mysteriously-vanishes\">Communist Billionaire Accused Of Funding Anti-ICE Riots Mysteriously Vanishes</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/masked-protest-industrial-complex-isnt-peaceful-its-civil-terrorism-playbook-combat-chaos\">The Protest-Industrial-Complex Isn't Peaceful, It's \"Civil Terrorism\"...</a></em></p> </li> </ul><p>One alarming aspect of these ongoing color revolution operations by the Democrats and their NGO complex is the <strong>co-mingling of foreign interests</strong>.
