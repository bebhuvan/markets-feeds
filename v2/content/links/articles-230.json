Speaking to reporters after the raid, Ben Gvir said: <strong>\"The Temple Mount is for the Jews, and we will remain here forever.\"</strong></p> <p>Since becoming a minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, Ben Gvir has led at least 11 assaults on the mosque. Meanwhile, several other far-right politicians have <strong>advocated for the destruction of Al-Aqsa and the construction of a temple where they claim Jewish temples once stood</strong>.</p> <p>Among the hundreds of people to take part in Sunday's raid was right-wing Likud lawmaker Amit Halevi, who has repeatedly advocated for Israel to destroy all water, food and energy sources in Gaza.</p> <p>In June 2023, he tabled a bill that would divide Al-Aqsa Mosque between Muslims and Jews, a plan that would see shared access from the courtyard of the Dome of the Rock to the end of the northern border of Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p> <p>Palestinians fear that the incursions at Al-Aqsa, which have intensified since Israel went to war on Gaza in October 2023, are laying the groundwork for the mosque to be divided similar to how the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron was in the 1990s.</p> <p>Muslims currently have limited access to that site, and just last month, Israel transferred the authority of the mosque from the Palestinian-run Hebron municipality to a settler council.</p> <p>Aouni Bazbaz, the director of international affairs at the Islamic Waqf, the organisation that administers Al-Aqsa Mosque, described Sunday's raid as \"painful and regrettable\", telling MEE that it was a threat to the \"historical status quo and an incitement to violence\".</p> <p>\"There were terrifying numbers of people [Israeli settlers] present and some were important figures,\" he said. \"This was part of a project. The extreme religious right seeks to undermine the status quo and to clearly follow the example of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.</p> <p>\"There are no worshippers here right now, the place is empty, the Old City is empty. <strong>It's a military barracks</strong>,\" he added.</p> <p>The Jerusalem Governorate also decried the raid, and appealed to the international community, in particular Muslim states, \"to take immediate action\".</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir sparked fresh outrage today after performing Talmudic rituals inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, accompanied by an associate who carried out the “epic prostration”, a form of Jewish worship explicitly prohibited at the site <a href=\"https://t.co/pv3aKSaJvc\">pic.twitter.com/pv3aKSaJvc</a></p> — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MiddleEastEye/status/1951940076071473266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>\"What happened today is not just a traditional incursion.

As with previous actions, the protests were primarily <strong>attended by crazed, elderly white liberals</strong>. The Democrats and their NGO machine have lost not just the narrative but are drifting deeper into irrelevance. </p> <p>50501 (\"50 Protests, 50 States, 1 Movement\") is part of the <strong>permanent protest-industrial complex</strong> and was behind the underwhelming demonstrations this weekend. The group's mission is to organize large-scale, <strong>nationwide color revolution-style operations against President Trump</strong>, including these previous events:</p> <ul><li> <p><em>February 5: Anti-Trump kickoff rallies </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>February 17 (Presidents' Day): \"No Kings on Presidents Day\"</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>March 4: Third round of demonstrations</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>April 5: \"Hands Off\" protests, among the largest anti-Trump protests </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>June 14: \"No Kings\"</em></p> </li> </ul><p><strong>Each of the nationwide protests listed above has failed to generate enough momentum</strong> to shift public opinion and move the polls. The dark-money-funded NGOs behind the permanent protest-industrial complex have grown increasingly frustrated; so much so that they reportedly offered $20 million to a 'rent-a-protester' firm. </p> <p>Last month, Adam Swart, CEO of an activist group called \"Crowds on Demand\", called out one unnamed leftist entity ...</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"</em><strong><em>We had to reject an offer worth around $20 million for nationwide, large-scale demonstrations across the country.

    "fullContent": "Last year there was a major discovery of circuitry for how our immune system in the body activates the brain. In the past couple of weeks we&#8217;re seeing progress in understanding how the brain controls the immune system, including the clinical relevance, the first of its kind, a new FDA approval. In this issue of Ground Truths I&#8217;ll review the recent reports that spotlight the pivotal role of reciprocal interactions between our brain and immune system.Subscribe nowI&#8217;ve recently written about the gut-brain axis and how the gut talks to the brain and the immune system. There&#8217;s a common thread, the vagus nerve, which as shown in yellow in the map below, connects the brain with various organs throughout the body, including rich innervation of the gut lining. Beyond the vagal circuitry, other neural connections connect the spleen, gut, liver, bone marrow and lymph nodes (&#8592;new review in Nature Reviews Immunology) can activate the immune system&#8217;s T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, plasma cells, production of antibodies, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Below is an example of how the brain connects through the splenic nerve can rev up the immune system (PVN-paraventricular nucleus, AChR-acetycholine receptor, RAMP-receptor activity-modifying protein, TIMP-tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase). The connections between the brain and immune system are not just neural mediated, but also occur via hormones and chemical signals, especially mediated via the brain&#8217;s hypothalamus-pituitary axis.With that anatomic basis, let&#8217;s get into the new reports and advances.Share Ground Truths1. Just seeing a person with signs of infection activates our immune response!This week in Nature Neuroscience Andrea Serino and colleagues published the results of 248 healthy volunteers who underwent virtual reality to see human avatar faces categorizing persons with signs of infection (coughing, rashes), one of fear, and another of neutrality (&#8220;Neural anticipation of virtual infection triggers an immune response.&#8221;). The participants underwent functional MRI, EEG and immune system studies. The infectious avatars activated the hypothalamic-pituitary axis which led to immune activation, replicated by flu vaccine administration, as seen below by innate lymphoid cells (ILC) and verified by multiple markers of lymphocytes. That wasn&#8217;t evoked by the neutral or fearful avatars.2. An implantable neuroimmune modulation device for autoimmune diseaseLast year Peterson and colleagues published a randomized, double-blind, sham controlled trial of an implantable 1 inch device to stimulate the vagus nerve in 60 patients with rheumatoid arthritis to show feasability and safety. Using the same double-blind, sham design, a Phase 3 trial was undertaken enrolling 242 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who had failed at least one advanced drug therapy (biologic or synthetic disease modifying drug). The device delivers stimulation for 1 minute each day and is recharged during 10 minutes each week wirelessly via a necklace (schematic below). At 12 weeks, 35% of patients receiving daily stimulation vs 24% of the sham device achieved improvement in the ACR20 endpoint (American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria). For the 28-joint Disease Activity Score based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) endpoint, the treatment group had a 27% response vs 16% in the control group. By 1 year, with crossover all to the active device, over 60% of participants had relief of joint pain and swelling. The main adverse effect was hoarseness, which occurred in 2% of participants due to the device implant.SetPoint Systems, the company that commercialized the device, received FDA approval this week and that was on the front page of the New York Times. The company has also published efficacy results for the device in the experimental model of multiple sclerosis and have already initiated clinical trials for inflammatory bowel disease in children and lupus and plans to do clinical trials for multiple sclerosis and Crohn&#8217;s disease.This is an outgrowth of the pioneering work of Prof Kevin Tracey who has been the main force over 2 decades to push the field forward. His classic paper in Nature in 2002 entitled &#8220;The Inflammatory Reflex&#8221; advanced the concept that vagal nerve stimulation could suppress inflammation. Share3. The Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Risk of APOE4 Carriers is Mediated via the Immune SystemOne copy of the APOE &#949;4 allele is present in about 20% of people and is the strongest genetic risk factor of late-onset Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. That discovery was made in 1993 but the mechanism for how the &#949;4 allele induces the risk has not been clear in the three subsequent decades. In Nature Medicine, Shvetcov and colleagues demonstrated that carriers of the &#949;4 allele have a proteomic signature denoting immune dysregulation. From machine learning of nearly 10,000 plasma samples and 1,300 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, there was convergence of many findings between plasma (shown below) and CSF, and a pro-inflammatory signature was seen. There was marked immune cell enrichment, predominately T cells, monocytes, and natural killer cells. This finding reshapes our understanding for how the APOE &#949;4 allele increases the risk of neurodegenerative disease.Parenthetically, another clarification for an elusive mechanism of action (MoA), there was a reset for how metformin works. As the first line drug for Type 2 diabetes used for 60 years, there were many ideas for its MoA such as reducing glucose output from the liver. We just learned metformin relies on a pathway in the brain to exert its effect.4. A Multiomics Study for Alzheimer's and Cerebrovascular Diseases A new paper in Neuron examined RNA and epigenetic variants for Alzheimer&#8217;s (AD) and stroke (study schematic below) and found that the former was linked to dysregulated immune system omics, with a lead variant that enhanced expression of PTK2B in brain T cells. The evidence for altered adaptive immunity for AD was in marked contrast to the findings for omics related to cerebrovascular diseases, and provides yet another study highlighting the immune system&#8217;s status as off the track for AD.Other Related ReportsA randomized trial of structured lifestyle improvement with coaching for an anti-inflammatory diet, exercise, as compared with controls who were self-guided, showed significant improvement in global cognition.A study of ME/CFS by Akiko Iwasaki and colleagues, using plasma and CSF samples of affected individuals and matched controls, demonstrated 2 distinct immunotypes for this condition, which is characterized by many symptoms that are referable to the central nervous system. A randomized trial of semaglutide (Ozempic) vs placebo in participants with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy, a pro-inflammatory condition (mean BMI of participants =33 ) was preprint published. The GLP-1 drug slowed epigenetic aging and the pace of aging across 11 organ and system clocks. This likely reflects the potent anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs, both systemically and in the brain. The significant slowing of the pace of brain aging (nearly 5 years) is shown below at right. As far as I know, this is the first drug in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to demonstrate such epigenetic and organ clock findings. Clearly, we&#8217;ll need to see independent replication in healthy individuals who are not overweight or obese, but these results are nonetheless encouraging.Share Ground TruthsConcluding RemarksIn my book Super Agers, I have a chapter on &#8220;Controlling Our Immune System&#8221; which goes through the ways we are taking control of our immune system like a rheostat. Dialing it down to achieve tolerance in autoimmune diseases, such as engineered T cells that bind to a protein on the surface of all B cells (CD-19). That has achieved remarkable success in a small number of individuals with several autoimmune diseases (lupus, multiple sclerosis, polymyositis, and others). In prior Ground Truths posts, I&#8217;ve reviewed other ways we can dial down the immune response, such as through the liver (!) or tolerogenic vaccines. Here, the studies on vagal stimulation have now validated yet another approach that we can suppress the immune system and inflammation and the indication for rheumatoid arthritis is likely just the beginning. Perhaps there will be simpler, inexpensive, non-implantable devices to achieve vagal nerve stimulation such as was anecdotally reported for Long Covid. We&#8217;re also learning about how the GLP-1 drugs can be used to block inflammation, awaiting the results of the EVOKE Alzheimer&#8217;s randomized trials next month. Just as our armamentarium is expanding for suppressing the immune system, we&#8217;re seeing how it can be dialed up too. For example, the results of the 3 natural experiments of Shingles vaccines that consistently lowered the rate of dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, reviewed here, or how more aggressive ways to rev up the immune system are leading to heightened treatment success for refractory cancers. However, there&#8217;s a fine line for unleashing the immune system with the potential of promoting a self-directed or dysregulated state. Despite that critical concern, we&#8217;re making major strides in controlling our immune system.Ironically, we still don&#8217;t have a way to measure it routinely, as I conveyed in Why We Need an Immunome. That remains a huge hole in the story for how we&#8217;re going to be able to promote healthy aging. Here, for example, I&#8217;m referring to the need to detect the degree of immunosenescence in older adults that poses a vulnerability for cancer and other age-related diseases. With all the new data pouring in for the primacy of the immune system, we need to accelerate ways to get a handle on a person&#8217;s immune system status.That brings me to the recent organ clock paper on the plasma proteomics of healthspan and longevity. In 17-year follow-up of the ~45,000 UK Biobank participants, assessing 8 organs (including heart, kidney, artery, brain, liver, pancreas, lung and immune system). Slow aging of the brain or immune system was linked with the best survival (Figure) and there was also evidence that slow paced aging of both the brain and immune system provided additional benefit beyond each alone. I hope I&#8217;ve convinced you that through a variety of different studies, the brain-immune axis has emerged as more important than previously acknowledged. That&#8217;s noteworthy as a root cause of neurodegenerative diseases and for coming up with improved treatments. It&#8217;s giving us a great foundation to build on to prevent these diseases in the future and promote healthy aging.************************************************Thanks to many of you Ground Truth subscribers who helped put SUPER AGERS on the NYT bestseller list for 4 weeks so far.

Fueling <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2023/09/25/rcps_wegmann_to_agriculture_secretary_vilsack_is_the_us_monitoring_purchase_of_farmland_by_chinese_government_interests.html\">the bipartisan concern:</a> fears that proximity to those sensitive installations could make them prone to drone attack or surveillance.</p> <p>Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced last month that the federal government would move to ban sales of farmland nationwide to buyers tied to China. If signed into law, the Blackburn bill would deliver on that promise.</p> <p>While China is the primary target, the legislation would also prohibit purchases from North Korea, Iran, and Russia.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/500EB027-1844-468F-9757-F58AA0D5DD90\">The second bill</a> focuses on the capital city:</strong> It would require the District of Columbia to end so-called “sister city” arrangements with adversarial nations. Washington, D.C., has entered into no less than 15 non-formal arrangements with cities around the world. Some are innocuous, such as Athens and Paris. One is a relic of hopes not realized.</p> <p>Then-Mayor Marion Barry signed the Washington-Beijing Sister City Friendship agreement in 1984 when the U.S. still hoped that normalizing relations with China would lead to liberalization. It did not. Blackburn and other Republicans now warn that “sister city” arrangements, while informal, provide an adversarial regime a sort of soft power through diplomatic legitimacy and access to sensitive U.S. institutions.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/369F964E-58D8-4FAC-8AD9-591CDF6D995A\">The third bill</a> would require the Department of Housing and Urban Development to work with state and local governments to assess whether and how foreign buyers, including those using shell corporations, “are distorting U.S. housing markets and threatening national security.”</strong></p> <p>The legislation comes as Trump shakes up the world stage through a series of new trade deals and reevaluated alliances. Even as the president insists that U.S. relations with China are improving, his administration has taken steps to gain an upper hand in the rivalry with the communist superpower. He has bolstered military spending. He has deregulated the artificial intelligence industry in order to maintain U.S. dominance in that field. He insists that the United States will remain preeminent.</p> <p>Perhaps most significantly, Trump made a rising China a bipartisan concern. While previous administrations cast a wary eye on an increasingly bellicose Beijing, his first candidacy thrust the issue front and center nearly a decade ago. And former President Joe Biden did not throttle back during his time in office, notably keeping Trump’s tariffs on China in place and describing the coming century as a competition between autocracy and democracy.</p> <p><strong>Blackburn shares those concerns. Her current effort focuses on the domestic front.</strong></p> <p>“The United States cannot allow foreign adversaries like Communist China to quietly embed themselves in our communities and near our critical infrastructure,” the senator told RCP.</p> <p>“We have a responsibility to identify and address these threats,” Blackburn added, before describing her legislative practice as an effort that “shines a light on these activities and will help protect American property and sovereignty.”</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T18:00:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 14:00</span>",

Araghchi said that his message to Witkoff has been that there needs to be a “win-win” deal and that the US needs to show real “confidence-building” measures.</p> <p>“The road to negotiation is narrow but<strong> it’s not impossible</strong>. I need to convince my hierarchy that if we go for negotiation, the other side is coming with real determination for a win-win deal,” he said.</p> <p>The US has also shown no sign that it’s willing to give Iran assurances that it won’t be attacked again, since President Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb the country again if it restarts its nuclear enrichment program. Araghchi reaffirmed that Tehran wouldn’t agree to a deal that doesn’t allow it to enrich uranium at low levels.</p> <p>“We can negotiate, they can present their argument and we will present our own argument,” Araghchi said.<strong> “But with zero enrichment, we don’t have a thing,”</strong> Araghchi.</p> <p>He also reaffirmed that Iran didn’t want a nuclear bomb and would continue to abide by a 2003 fatwa from the Iranian Supreme Leader that prohibited the production of nuclear weapons.</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T16:50:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 12:50</span>",
