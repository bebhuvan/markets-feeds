It's a mirage You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage\" After the almost unprecedented jobs revisions last week, Trump came out swinging Incompetency at best, he declared, and intentional sabotage at worst. I agree with the first accusation. The BLS has been struggling with data integrity for a looong time. As for the second accusation - that it has been intentional - possibly. Someone has been rigging the data in very obvious ways. But I don't think it was political. PROBLEM #1: Garbage in, Garbage Out There has been a general decline in the response rates for government data surveys. When you ask 100,000 companies to declare payrolls, and only 40,000 respond, the data gets skewed. Fore example, I would guess that companies with HR departments are more likely to send back a survey versus Joe's Pizza shop. That, in turn, means that the payrolls under-represent smaller businesses. And since smaller companies typically are more sensitive to changes in economic winds, that means the data lags. And that means that big decisions made by the Fed are laggy. KILLING THE WRONG MESSENGER Who is Erika McEntarfer, the ex-Director of the BLS? Let me start by saying that I don't know any of the players and I don't have contact with the BLS or have detailed insight into the minutia of their process. But the basics are self-evident: she is a scapegoat. McEntarfer has a PhD in Economics and started her career as an economist with the Census Bureau. She quickly moved into an advisory role on the topic of labor markets. She was a member of the Council of Economic Advisors before becoming the BLS Director in January 2024. Boiled down, McEnterfer is a very credentialed labor economist. Does she have experience managing large organizations? Not that I see. Does she have familiarity with the data gathering process unique to the BLS? No, but she has some tangential experience and knows the general problem. McEnterfer as scapegoat Generally speaking, the BLS Director role is less functional and more of a political reward. The Director blesses the work that is assembled by the actual mechanics assembled Unfortunately for Erika, she was given the mandate of fixing the data collection problem. That's unfair because all agencies have the same problem and they were jointly trying to address it. Also bad for Erika: in typical government fashion, the fix was taking years and the data credibility just got worse. Strike One: Annual Revision Cuts 810K jobs in March. Instead of the rosy picture painted of the 2024 economy (2.8M jobs!!), a more sluggish 2M jobs were created. Worse, that level of correction was unprecedented (except for during the madness of COVID) Strike Two: The recent NFP report removed 280K jobs for May and June. Just days before, Fed Chairman Powell pushed back on interest rate cuts because of a strong jobs market narrative. Trump did not wait for Strike Three. Many have accused Trump's firing of McEntarfer as harming the credibility of an important government institution. In fact, that damage was already done by the institution itself. Bottomline: In California (a la the Pacific Palisades fire), leaders can retain their jobs even when massive incompetency happens on their watch. Under Trump, leaders get fired if there are screw-ups. (One could argue that Trump is selective in his firings. For example, Secretary of Defense Hegseth's using Signal to communicate war details was incompetence of a kind, but since it wasn't directly tied to his prosecution of duties over the Pentagon, he was forgiven.) EVIDENCE OF DATA SKEWING: THE WHAT BUT NOT THE WHO AND WHY For the past months I have pointed to two very obvious signs of tinkering with the payroll data. Let me revisit them. Example #1: Creating 98K jobs out of nowhere. In April, 98K materialized out of nowhere, boosting the April NFP substantially. You can go back in time for decades, but something of this scale has never happened (COVID excepted). That is, the typical monthly payroll growth for this sector is ~15K, with a peak of around 22K. Nowhere near 98K Also, the jump came and went in just one month. When a sector is growing or fading, it does so in a wave. This is 100% data manipulation. Example #2: Public Sector Education In the June preliminary NFP report, ~70K jobs came from the State and Local public education sector. Somehow, schools retained more workers than they have in decades. It was even more unbelievable when you consider that these schools have a lot more staff and even more seasonal workers to layoff. THE DEVIL IN THE DETAILS Maybe this wasn't intentional. We've all heard stories about a junior banker accidentally fat fingering the data entry and sending billions instead of millions. The question is why wasn't this detected. In both examples, someone accidentally or intentionally changed the data. I saw it immediately, within minutes of the data releases. Yet how many eyes at the BLS looked at this and saw no problem? Because this demonstrates that issues go beyond data collection and are specific BLS oversight problems. Was the Director of the BLS simply not paying sufficient attention to her organization's single most important product? She clearly has the capability. (Reinforces my view that she is just a figurehead and responsible for the mess only insofar as it's happening under her watch.) TO THE PARANOID, A WEB OF DECEPTION Trump has reasons to suspect government bureaucracies are out to get him. In the ebb-and-flow of economic data, he sees a pattern that suggests political sabotage. namely, boosting Biden when it mattered, and undermining Trump when it hurts the most: Election year In the run-up to the election, the Fed cuts rates and the BLS reports solid jobs data. Both actions are positive for Biden. March Jobs Revisions After the election, the BLS says \"oops! Things were bad after all.\" Super weak jobs report in July In the run up to the critical July Fed meeting about interest rate cuts, the BLS reports months of solid payrolls. After the Fed decides not to cut rates, the entire 'strong jobs' narrative is completely destroyed by BLS data revision I don't think that they are out to get you, Mr. President. Trump should welcome the revisions that say the jobs market is weak. It supports his effort to get rate cuts. He just doesn't like being tarred with a weak economy. I do think that there is an institutional bias that overstates jobs. Or at least that there was an institutional bias until recently. At the same time, mysteries remain Who did this? I go back to the data fudging examples that I found. These weren't the result of model mechanics that add 20K jobs a month. These jobs simply did not happen and were very large and impactful (in fact the public sector education example from June was eliminated in the July revision). Somebody created them out of thin air. Just as somebody decided to remove them. And why? Why these bizarre job-pumping moves? And why the big unwinding? Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 08:05",

    "fullContent": "Shocking, Record Explosion In Student Loan Delinquencies Marks The Start Of Next Debt Crisis Total household debt rose by $185 billion in the second quarter of 2025, a 1% rise from Q1 2025. Balances now stand at $18.39 trillion and have increased by $4.24 trillion since the end of 2019, just before the pandemic recession. Before is a snapshot of the latest Q2 data, courtesy of the NY Fed: Balances Mortgage balances grew by $131 billion during the second quarter of 2025 and totaled $12.94 trillion at the end of June. Balances on home equity lines of credit (HELOC) rose by $9 billion, the thirteenth consecutive quarterly increase. There is now $411 billion in outstanding HELOC balances, $94 billion above the low reached in the first quarter of 2022. Credit card balances rose by $27 billion during the second quarter and now total $1.21 trillion outstanding and are 5.87% above the level a year ago. Auto loan balances rose by $13 billion, and now stand at $1.66 trillion. Other balances, which include retail cards and consumer finance loans, were roughly unchanged at $540 billion. Student loan balances edged up by $7 billion and now stand at $1.64 trillion. In total, non-housing balances increased by $45 billion, a 0.9% increase from 2025Q1. Originations Mortgage originations increased slightly, with $458 billion newly originated in Q2. There were $188 billion in new auto loans and leases during Q2, an increase from the $166 billion observed in the first quarter of 2025. Aggregate limits on credit cards continued to rise, with a $78 billion (1.5%) uptick in the second quarter. Home equity lines of credit (HELOC) limits rose by $18 billion, continuing the growth in HELOC limits that began in 2022 Credit Quality Credit quality of newly originated loans was mixed: The credit scores of newly originated auto loans decreased, as the median score for auto loan originations decreased by 6 points. There was an improvement in the credit quality of mortgages, as the median score of newly originated mortgage loans increased by 5 points and the tenth percentile score increased by 13 points. About 53,000 individuals had new foreclosure notations on their credit reports, a decline from the previous quarter All of the above is more or less as expected: yes, the US consumer is drowning in (ever more) debt, but that's hardly a surprise: since life for middle class Americans is now largely unaffordable, most Americans have no choice but to take on even more debt. There was, however, one big shock, and it had to do with the trillions in student debt in general, and the end of the repayment moratorium in particular (see \"Trump Admin Begins Collecting On Student Loans In Default\"). As the NY Fed notes, aggregate delinquency rates \"remained elevated in the second quarter of 2025\" which is putting it mildly. As of the end of June, 4.4% of outstanding debt was in some stage of delinquency, which is 0.1% higher than the first quarter. And while transition into early delinquency held steady for nearly all debt types; the exception was for student loans, which saw another uptick in the rate at which balances went from current to delinquent due to the resumption of reporting of delinquent student loans on credit reports after a nearly 5-year pause due to the pandemic. Student loan delinquencies have been on the rise since the beginning of the year, after the government ended Biden's years-long payment freeze. As the charts below show, transition rates into serious delinquency, defined as 90 or more days past due, were largely stable for auto loans and credit cards (although both were elevated compared to previous years), edged up slightly for mortgages and HELOCs ... and absolutely exploded higher for student loans, as the share of student-loan debt entering serious delinquency was 12.9%, the highest in 21 years of data! In fact, as one can clearly see there has never been such a catastrophic deterioration in student loan in US history across borrowers of virtually all ages, but especially those 50 and over! The record surge in delinquencies suggests American households, especially those with student loans, are facing increasing financial distress this year amid high interest rates and a slowdown in hiring. Recent data showed consumer spending fell in the first six months of 2025, even before tariffs started to boost prices. While transitions into delinquency is the start of the bankruptcy pipeline, the end is also getting busier, and about 131.000 consumers had a bankruptcy notation added to their credit reports in Q2, an increase from the previous quarter. Expect this number to explode once all those student loan delinquencies transition to defaults in a few months at which point the student loan crisis becomes front and center. The dramatic deterioration will be another factor forcing the Fed to cut rates in September. Last week, Fed chair Jerome Powell said of delinquency rates, “Essentially, you have a consumer that’s in good shape and is spending,” though admittedly “not at a rapid rate.” Actually, turns out the consumer - when it comes to student loans - is now broker than ever. In a briefing with reporters, New York Fed researchers said student-loan delinquencies would likely continue to rise, eventually returning to pre-pandemic levels. Between late 2012 and early 2020, the share of student debt that was seriously delinquent ranged between 10.7% and 11.8%. “This quarter’s flow of household debt into serious delinquency was mixed across debt types, with credit card and auto loans holding steady, student loans continuing to rise and mortgages edging up slightly,” Joelle Scally, an economic policy adviser at the New York Fed, said in a press release, underplaying the clearly catastrophic surge in student loan delinquencies, and soon, defaults which will result in tens of millions of consumers suddenly finding themselves carved out from the US consumer economy just as the student loan crisis goes front and center.
