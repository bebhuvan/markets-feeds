    "fullContent": "Orsted Shares Crash Below IPO Price On \"Unexpected\" Rights Issue Shares of Danish company Orsted A/S crashed the most on record after the wind developer announced a rights offering of up to 60 billion kroner ($9.4 billion). The offering aims to stabilize its finances, which have been hit hard by soaring costs, supply chain disruptions, and President Trump's rollback of \"green\" energy projects. Orsted shares plunged 29%, falling below their 2016 IPO price after the company announced the largest share offering in the European energy sector since Enel SpA in 2009. The capital raise is an attempt by the CEO to shore up finances as the entire green energy sector comes under severe pressure in the era of Trump and common-sense energy policies. With wind farm construction as its core business, Orsted has been exposed to more canceled projects than any of its industry peers, including ones in the US and the UK. The funding gap swelled after scrapping a stake sale in the Sunrise Wind project off New York. Orsted also announced the sale of its European onshore wind unit, targeting 35 billion kroner from divestments by next year, and plans to invest 145 billion kroner from 2025-27 while maintaining an investment-grade rating and resuming dividends in 2026. Full-year EBITDA guidance remains at 25 to 28 billion kroner, though offshore wind targets were cut due to weaker wind speeds. \"Orsted and our industry are in an extraordinary situation with the adverse market development in the US on top of the past years' macroeconomic and supply chain challenges,\" CEO Rasmus Errboe said in a statement. Commenting on the rights offer, Goldman analysts led by Alberto Gandolfi told clients that Orsted's offering was \"largely unexpected, with clarity expected by mid-September… but also a clean-up move.\" Gandolfi explained more: Orsted has just announced the intention to carry out a DKK 60 bn rights issue (c.€8 bn), equivalent to around 45% of its market capitalisation. Although not totally unexpected to us – in our recent report (here), we flagged execution risks on disposals and FCF headwinds from rolling incentives – we believe this would come as a surprise to most of the Sell Side. Given the size, the rights issue would be highly dilutive, and hence we believe could lead to a swift drop in the share price. We also note that we have not seen the terms of the rights issue, and the terms (based on the H1 investor presentation available on Orsted website) would be disclosed in the first half of September, thus implying 3-4 weeks of market uncertainty. On the other hand, we highlight that once completed, this would most likely represent a \"clean up move\" as we would expect the resulting B/S (post rights issue) to be solid. As a reference, consensus YE Net Debt currently stands at DKK 75 bn on Bloomberg, and we project 2025 EBITDA at DKK c.28 bn. A restored B/S strength would put less pressure on Orsted to divest assets (current plan implies DKK 40 bn pending disposals). Lastly, we also flag that, pre raise, Bloomberg consensus P/E for 2026 is a mere 12x; the stock would therefore not be on an overly high P/E even post rights. We remain Neutral rated. The analysts maintained a \"Neutral\" rating on the stock with a 300-kroner 12-month price target. Orsted shares in Copenhagen are down 27% - the largest daily decline on record. Shares are now below the IPO level. Here's what other research desks are telling their clients (courtsey of Bloomberg): Jefferies (hold) Analyst Ahmed Farman says in note also published before Orsted's confirmation any rights issue is likely \"clearly negative\" due to dilution concerns Says \"risk-reward post any such raise will depend on the medium-term growth outlook Orsted sets out,\" while any raise \"would enhance confidence regarding the balance sheet, reducing dependency on execution of farmdowns\" In note published after the company announcement that near- term dilution \"seems substantial given size of the raise (much bigger than the figure reported by BBG last Friday) and seemingly no new growth angle\" Bloomberg Intelligence (no rating) Analysts Patricio Alvarez and Joao Martins say issue \"reflects exposure to structural policy headwinds in the US, where inability to farm down Sunrise Wind (0.9 GW) could widen its funding gap by more than 40 billion kroner, including capex overruns\" Add that Orsted's planned 8.1 GW buildout in 2025-2027 now appears \"well capitalized, yet execution and growth risks in its Europe portfolio are mounting\" RBC Capital Markets (sector perform) Analyst Alexander Wheeler notes company is flagging headwinds in US wind farm market will stop a planned partial divestment of the Sunrise Wind project, leading to additional funding needs of DKK40 billion Says that while company's balance sheet and selling assets have been a main focus, \"we think more of the focus was on assets such as Hornsea 3 and Changhua 2, with most of the rights issue being consumed by the additional requirements for Sunrise Wind, a project which is already materially squeezed on returns . . .

    "fullContent": "\"Super Steel\": China Unveils Game-Changing Cryogenic Steel for Fusion Reactors China has developed a breakthrough material, CHSN01 (China high-strength low-temperature steel No 1), capable of withstanding extreme cold and massive magnetic forces, and deployed it this year in the world’s first fusion nuclear power generation reactor, according to SCMP. The steel puts China at the forefront of materials science and could have applications beyond fusion. The ultra-strong cryogenic steel meets the demands of superconducting magnets operating near absolute zero and in magnetic fields of up to 20 Tesla. It can endure stresses of 1,300MPa and has superior fatigue resistance to traditional alloys. “In addition to its applications in superconductivity, this steel can also be used in other related areas,” said Zhao Zhongxian, a top Chinese physicist. Development began after a 2011 setback at the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France, where cryogenic steel turned brittle under testing. China’s team, led by Li Laifeng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spent over a decade refining the material—starting with nitrogen-enhanced stainless steel, then incorporating vanadium and controlling carbon/nitrogen ratios. Foreign experts had called the new approach “absolutely impossible,” but Zhao encouraged persistence: “Do not blindly trust foreign authorities. This matter is worth pursuing.” In 2021, China set strict specifications—1,500MPa yield strength and over 25% elongation at cryogenic temperatures—described by fusion expert Li Jiangang as essential for the country’s compact fusion devices. SCMP writes that the High-Strength Steel Research Alliance, uniting institutes, companies, and welding specialists, fast-tracked progress through biweekly technical forums and independent testing. By August 2023, CHSN01 met all targets and entered production for the Burning Plasma Experimental Superconducting Tokamak (BEST), now under construction and due for completion in 2027. Of its 6,000 tonnes of components, 500 tonnes of conductor jackets are made from CHSN01. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 06:55",

    "fullContent": "The Market Game Is Rigged And Everyone Is Lying... Still Submitted by QTR's Fringe Finance I just sat down with Dan Ferris on Stansberry’s Investor Hour for one of the most honest, wide-ranging interviews I’ve done in a while. Before this conversation hits the wider world, I wanted to make it available first to you — my paid subscribers. It pulls from years of experience, harsh lessons, and truths that don’t get spoken on CNBC or passed around in TikTok trading rooms. I started the conversation with a little self-deprecating humor, pointing out that I thought my “half-life with ever being invited back to anything Stansberry after my 2019 onstage performance in Las Vegas was much longer than six years.” I told the story of how I showed up from the pool in a tank top for that event and how “I’m just going to go and say what I want to say. And that’s going to be it. And if I don’t get invited back, you know, that’s okay.” My philosophy is simple—say what I want, enjoy myself, and if people get flustered over salty language, so be it. When we got into the subject of tariffs and manufacturing, I admitted that while tariffs have downsides, “I don’t think that it’s a bad idea… to make this hard stop and say, listen, we have to do something.” COVID had exposed how much we rely on overseas production for critical items—“the ingredients that are used to make pharmaceuticals, the pharmaceuticals themselves, the rare earth minerals, the things that really… hang significant portions of our quality of life.” I pointed out how “the only thing this country exports right now is dollars” and how trying to reverse decades of decline in domestic manufacturing is “like turning around the f*cking Titanic.” From there, I laid out what I think is the real danger: how financial markets are structured today. I explained the “passive bid” problem—how “people are buying the ETF, and that’s driving Apple higher” regardless of fundamentals. I said the danger is that when redemptions spike, “a lot of these funds don’t have cash liquid to absorb those redemptions” and instead “have… taken on leverage specifically so they don’t have to sell.” With 40% of S&P index money in just 10 stocks, “we’re really in a situation where we’re putting so many of our eggs all in seven baskets. And that’s frightening.” I also talked about the options market, which I see as one of “two giant f*cking trap doors underneath the market.” When dealers sell calls or puts, “there’s a certain percentage… they have to hedge against,” which can force huge amounts of buying during manias like GameStop. I said, “The entire market has become leveraged gambling. I mean, top to bottom.” The same mechanism can work in reverse, and “when that happens again, you’re going to see options weaponized in the other direction, which I think could be extremely dangerous.” We also got into specific names and the market darlings. I didn’t hold back on Cathie Wood and ARK Invest. “She promised 40% compounded returns some years back and ARKK has gone nowhere in comparison” The gap between the promise and reality is “just a little bit off.” I said bluntly, “There hasn’t been a piece of pre-order, pre-revenue dog sh*t that these people haven’t fallen in love with.” Without Tesla’s 10x run from late 2019 to mid-2020, “no one ever hears this woman, ever.” 🔥 TAKE 65% OFF IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TODAY: Anyone who subscribes annually today, using the below link, IMMEDIATELY gets 65% off full price. This discount lasts for as long as you wish to remain a subscriber: Get 65% off forever That doesn’t mean I’m a pessimist. “Most of my portfolio is long, but it’s just long in stuff that’s not mag seven sh*t.” I like value-oriented names like UPS, “which trades at 12 times earnings, pays a dividend… a business that’s going to be here forever.” I also own “gold miners, silver miners… nuclear… psychedelics” and “anything I can do to kind of get out of the system as it exists today.” If you’re holding insolvent companies or fad coins, “there is no bottom.” On the macro side, I see the MMT cycle accelerating, “widening the inequality gap,” and cornering the Fed. Inflation is still above target, so they’ll have to choose between “basically a quick deflationary depression or inflation.” I described this moment as a transition from “the gold standard to fiat… [to] fiat to digital” where “even more rules just kind of fly out the window because we have even more ways to micromanage the money supply.” I wrapped up by reminding people how quickly things can change. “One day it’s not a big issue and then you wake up the next day and people are fist fighting over toilet paper.” The lesson I’ve learned from a decade of short selling is simple: “Everybody’s a liar, everybody’s a fraud. Nothing is as it seems.” My advice: “Be vigilant about protecting yourself and protecting your… family and your community” and remember “the more complacent everybody gets, the more non-complacent you should become.” (WATCH THE FULL VIDEO INTERVIEW HERE) Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 06:30",
