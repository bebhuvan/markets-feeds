    "fullContent": "Go Ahead And Rage At Boomers, But The Problem Is The Entire Economic Order Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog, The entire economic order is bankrupt--ideologically, politically and financially. A friend sent me a clip of Tucker Carlson going off on the Boomer generation, and I get it. Tucker's takedown was epic and entertaining (at least for me), but his disgust and rage were real. So let's dig into the sources of those emotions. If you watch the clip, it's apparent that what really disgusts Tucker is the sanctimoniousness of the Boomers he references, the glibness of their virtue-signaling and claims to righteousness and significance. This extends to the financial level, where the sanctimony is expressed as a high-minded confidence that \"we earned it,\" overlooking the trillions of dollars handed to them on a Federal Reserve / bubble-economy / entitlements platter. I think we all get that, but the problem isn't the Boomers, it's the entire economic order. The Boomers were just the hitchhiker who were lucky enough to be picked up by the big-finned Cadillac on the way into Vegas. Even if everyone were absolute saints, they'd still own most of the wealth. Here's why. When Social Security was enacted in the 1930s, the retirement age was 65 and the average lifespan of Americans was 62. In other words, the program was intentionally designed to be self-funded (paid by a very modest tax on wages paid by both employer and employee) and act as a safety net for the fortunate few who lived long enough to collect it but who weren't lucky enough to be wealthy. As the economy boomed in the postwar era, the age of retirement (at a lower percentage of full benefits) was lowered to 62 as the average lifespan increased to 70 by 1965, when Medicare and Medicaid were enacted. At their inception, these programs were mere fractions of federal spending, and appeared to be \"good things\" that were affordable. The Boomers weren't born in the 1930s, and in 1965 they were kids. These entitlements were initiated in response to the grim reality that old age for the non-wealthy was generally a ticket to poverty. Fast-forward to today, and the average lifespan is 80 (with millions of elderly living a decade longer) and 3/4 of adult Americans are at risk of lifestyle diseases / metabolic disorders due to an unhealthy diet and poor fitness. Over half of Americans are diabetic or prediabetic. The entitlement programs to aid the elderly that were modest decades ago are now almost 50% of the entire federal budget, dwarfing all other spending. Entitlements aiding young families are so modest they aren't even a blip compared to the soaring budgets of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. (Disability entitlements were added to Social Security, greatly expanding the program's costs.) The budgets of these entitlement programs are on unsustainable parabolic trajectories. Medicare: And Medicaid: healthcare has soared from 5% of GDP to almost 20%. \"Unlimited free money\" tends to do that... Now we come to the main course, neoliberal economic magic. The basic idea of neoliberal economics is if we just free market forces, that will permanently generate growth and wealth. The net result was an orgy of financialization that benefited the few, not the many, and so policy makers turned to inflating asset bubbles as the \"cost-free\" way to boost growth and wealth. By lowering interest rates and flooding the economy with low-cost credit--monetary stimulus--assets will skyrocket, generating a wealth effect that loosens the purse strings of the asset owners as they see their wealth rise without them having to create any value whatsoever. Just sit back and watch your house and stock portfolio generate thousands of dollars of \"free money.\" The other neoliberal theory was \"trickle-down economics\": as the upper-middle class and wealthy spent freely, some of their immense gains in income and wealth would trickle down to the bottom 90%. But since the vast majority of the economy's gains were flowing to capital/assets rather than wages, this didn't happen. What happened instead is the already-rich who owned most of the assets got richer while those depending on wages got poorer. Add these forces together and what you get is extreme generational wealth inequality. Those who bought houses in the 1970s, 80s and 90s have profited immensely from housing bubbles #1 and #2 (the current bubble), and from stock bubbles #1 (dot-com), #2 (2007-08) and now #3 (The Everything Bubble). The entire economic order is bankrupt--ideologically, politically and financially. If nothing changes at the fundamental level, the rich will continue to get richer at the expense of those priced out of the bubblicious assets, and the older generations will continue to accrue unearned wealth while younger wage earners are reduced to debt-serfdom and wage slavery. It doesn't have to be this way, but we're going to have to change our values and the fundamental structures of our economy if we want a different outcome. * * * Check out my new book Ultra-Processed Life and my updated Books and Films.

    "fullContent": "German Military Sees 28% Surge In Recruits As Leaders Hype Russia Threat Germany's historic reversal on its military posture and stregnth has long been on display since near the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. Berlin has been drastically expanding its military spending and is even recently mulling compulsory service for the nation's armed forces. But even without this more dramatic action, the reality is that interest in joining the German Armed Forces has grown significantly, with military recruitment up 28% so far in 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, according to new Defence Ministry information published Thursday. Via Reuters By July 21, approximately 13,750 new recruits had joined the Bundeswehr, the defense miinistry said - which has involved fixed-term service contracts and voluntary military service. This has apparently been an increasingly attractive route for young people after finishing school. Currently, the Bundeswehr has around 183,100 active personnel, which is an increase of about 2,000 compared to last year. Voluntary service participation has also climbed by roughly 15%, reaching 11,350 recruits. While these numbers pale in comparison to the much larger militaries of the US, Russia, or even Ukraine - it marks the start of what could be a historic shift after the German military's post-WWII effective decimation. The Defence Ministry credits the increase to focused recruitment efforts on growing concerns about global security, and of course the percieved threat to Europe by Russia as a result of the still raging Ukraine war which is not far away geographically. The Kremlin has consistently denied allegations that President Putin has his eyes set on invading Europe or even a NATO 'eastern flank' country. German officials have voiced their view that the rise in enlistment encouraging, particularly given the urgent need to expand the military's ranks. Later this month Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s Cabinet is expected to vote on a draft bill to reform military service. All of this also of course makes NATO leadership happy, and is in the context of President Trump's serious push to get European members of the alliance to shoulder more of the common defense burden. If passed, the changes could come into effect in early 2026, prioritizing voluntary enlistment and improved conditions, featuring for example better pay - with the aim of attracting up to 15,000 new conscripts annually, according to German media.

    "fullContent": "Russia's Nuclear Ambitions Face Funding Crisis Via Eurasianet.org,m Russian energy entities, including Rosatom, are experiencing significant financing difficulties, raising doubts about their ability to fulfill international energy project commitments. Kazakhstan has decided to independently build thermal power plants originally contracted to Russia's Inter RAO due to a lack of promised financing, and is increasingly turning to China for nuclear power plant construction. Rosatom is seeking government financial support to maintain its global leadership in the nuclear energy market and carry out new projects, citing limited financing options due to international sanctions. Russian energy entities are experiencing financing woes, raising questions about whether Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear energy agency, will be able to fulfill its obligations to build Kazakhstan’s first atomic power plant. Already, financing troubles have caused another Russian state-controlled firm, Inter RAO, to lose out on constructing three thermal power plants in Kazakhstan. During a July 30 appearance before the Russian State Commission on Energy, Andrei Petrov, a top Rosatom official, openly acknowledged that Rosatom was seeking government support. The entity has the resources to complete ongoing work, but by 2027, it will need a financial injection to carry out new projects, Petrov indicated. Rosatom officials have been somewhat cagey in specifying exactly what kind of support they are seeking and have shied away from specifying an amount. For example, Rosatom’s chief, Alexei Likhachev, recently stated the entity is seeking the “provision of special resources” from the government, according to a report published by the Interfax news agency. In 2024, a Rosatom official, referring to a program to develop floating nuclear power plants, indicated that Rosatom had limited financing options due to international sanctions on Russia, and required state-subsidized low-interest loans in order for the company to maintain its industry lead in several areas. Rosatom presently enjoys a roughly 50 percent share of the global nuclear energy market, with operations even in several NATO member states, such as Turkey and Hungary. “The only way to maintain leadership with this product [floating nuclear power plants] is to subsidize exports even more than we already are,” Interfax quoted Vladimir Aptekarev, a top official at the Rosatom subsidiary Atomenergomash JSC, as saying in 2024, citing Chinese competition. The Russian government, given the immense burden on the state budget imposed by its war effort in Ukraine, has so far resisted pleas from energy entities for increased support. Rosatom officials have acknowledged that the lack of assistance has hindered efforts to build new types of thermal and nuclear units, known as units Shelf-M and Elena-AM. The Russian government’s cash crunch appears to be responsible for delays in construction of three planned Kazakh thermal power plants near Kokshetau, Semey and Ust-Kamenogorsk. Inter RAO signed a contract to build the three plants at an estimated cost of about $2.7 billion, with financing to be provided by Russian state-connected institutions. But the money never materialized. On July 31, Deputy Kazakh Prime Minister Roman Sklyar confirmed that Kazakhstan was ditching the contract with Inter RAO, adding that it would build the plants on its own, according to media reports. “When the company [Inter RAO] took on the obligation to build these facilities, it was supposed to receive export financing at a low rate. Unfortunately, they were unable to do this, so it was decided to build them independently,” he said. The Kazakh government’s decision to move on from Inter RAO on the thermal plant projects instantly sparks questions about the fate of Rosatom’s deal to build Kazakhstan’s first nuclear power station. When Kazakhstan’s Atomic Energy Agency announced in June that Rosatom would lead the consortium to build the plant on the shores of Lake Balkhash, it indicated that the deal was contingent on the Russian entity’s ability to arrange financing. “Work on the issue of attracting state export financing at the expense of the Russian Federation has begun,” a KAEA statement announced at the time. At the same time in June, Kazakh officials made the unexpected announcement that they were giving a contract to China’s National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) to build a second nuclear power plant. At the time, observers saw the announcement as a shrewd move to keep Kazakhstan’s two powerful neighbors, Russia and China, happy. But in hindsight, the move can also be seen as a hedge. On July 31, Kazakhstan appeared to give a vote of no-confidence in Rosatom’s ability to deliver on the nuclear plant. Sklyar, the deputy prime minister, announced that CNNC would lead construction of a third nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. He declined to disclose a cost estimate for the projects, adding that the locations of both the second and third nuclear power stations had not been determined. Even so, it appears Kazakhstan has a backup plan already in place in case the Rosatom deal falls through. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 03:30",
