    "fullContent": "For The First Time Since COVID Crash, Credit-Card Debt Shrinks For Second Month On the surface, there were no major surprises in today's consumer credit report: after last month's $5.1 billion increase, consensus expected a sequential increase of $7.5 billion and it got almost exactly that: an increase of $7.37 billion to $3.758 trillion, up from $3.749 trillion in May. However, taking a closer look at the components reveals something troubling. While boring non-revolving credit increased by $8.4 billion or more or less in line with what it has done in recent months... ... an increase that in Q2 was driven in roughly equal part from contribution in student loans (+8.2BN) and auto loans (+$5.1)... ... the surprise was in the amount of revolving loans, i.e. credit card debt, which declined by just over $1 billion in June, which was the second consecutive monthly drop in the series... ... which is very notable because that would make it the first time since the economic collapse at the peak of the covid crash. Which begs the question: is the a cause - i.e., will the economy now suffer a sharp slowdown with consumers clearly hunkering down and no longer charging it - or effect - has the economy already stalled and this is just the consequence. If indeed this is the latter, then expect a dramatic downward revision of all recent economic data, similar to what we saw last week with payrolls, as the US economy enters its new glideslope to a recession.

    "fullContent": "VDH: The Cincinnati Cop-Outs Authored by Victor Davis Hanson via American Greatness, Recently, a large group of black youths began pummeling several white adults in downtown Cincinnati. The original altercation apparently broke out between a black and white male in he-said/he-said fashion. But that dispute soon turned into a virtual free-for-all. Numerous male and female black youths sucker-punched a middle-aged woman and a man. Others continued to kick or body slam the victims, who were sprawled on their backs and seemingly unconscious. There were many disturbing aspects to the beat-downs. One, the violence broke out along racial and age fault lines. After the initial one-on-one dispute, groups of black youths swarmed solitary older white bystanders to pound them. Two, the surrounding assembled group of black youths not only failed to intervene to restrain the bullies. They also recorded the beatings for social media and were heard cheering on the one-sided violence. Three, there was neither a police presence nor any timely Good Samaritan interventions. Instead, what ended the attacks was simply the fact that at least two of the targets appeared nearly comatose. So their assailants apparently concluded that their agenda of beating whites into unconsciousness was mostly complete. Four, oddly few of the usual black spokespeople who habitually comment on interracial violence were to be seen. During the fake Jussie Smollett attack, self-appointed leaders from Al Sharpton to Kamala Harris immediately issued warnings about so-called systemic white racism that had reared its ugly head to victimize Smollett. Yet when it was revealed Smollett had concocted the entire charade—and even hired his own assaulters—there were few if any retractions from those once so eager to shout “racist!” Such demagoguery is a well-known pattern dating back to the days of the Tawana Brawley rape hoax, the Duke Lacrosse charade, the Covington kids ruse, the Michael Ford “Hands-up-Don’t Shoot” fabrication, the “pseudo-transformation of George Zimmerman into a ‘white Hispanic,’” or the NASCAR noose fable. Racialists too often concoct white racist attackers and go silent when the evidence proves fabricated—only to be primed to manipulate the next hoax. Five, the media and authorities did their best to either hide or play down the violence. City leaders, the chief of police, and the media variously blamed the mass black-on-white violence on 1) social media, 2) the original one-on-one dispute, 3) alcohol, 4) the lack of civilian intervention to stop the violence, and 5) a festival atmosphere—anything except endemic racial hatred shown toward whites from the crowd of black youths. Six, had a gang of white toughs beat middle-aged African-Americans senseless, recorded it, and cheered on the violence, there would have been immediate national outrage. Nor did anyone wish to raise the taboo topic of inordinate black crime rates, disproportionate to respective demographic realities. In rare interracial violent crimes, the asymmetrical ratio of black-on-white versus white-on-black assaults ranges from three to five times greater. Seven, the quiet of the left-wing media to the reprehensible violence stands in marked contrast with their usual rush-to-judgment racialism in two near-simultaneous incidents. When a shooter of mixed African-American heritage recently entered a New York City corporate headquarters and executed four innocents, CNN falsely raised the speculation that a “white male” was perhaps responsible—despite the photograph of the suspect, who was as clearly male as he was not white. Media and municipal officials jumped to explain the violence as due to the killer’s alleged past traumatic brain injury or because of his access to a semi-automatic weapon—or anything other than his hate-filled plan to murder an NFL executive. Actress and model Sydney Sweeney just cut a jeans commercial in front of a poster that said, “Sydney Sweeney has great genes”—with “genes” crossed out and replaced with “jeans.” The left then exploded, alleging the ad was a supposed Hitlerian reference to white eugenics. Yet the eugenics movement in America was mostly a product of left-wing progressives, from Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger to Democrat president Woodrow Wilson. And the ad’s sponsor, American Eagle, had previously used all sorts of models from all racial backgrounds. All might agree that the ad simply shows both tight, sexy jeans and a naturally attractive wearer—period. The country is descending into a tribal morass of double standards and racial fixations. The diversity/equity/inclusion industry, the Defund-the-Police madness, and the perpetual left-wing hunt for “white racism/white privilege/white rage”—from the prior Pentagon hierarchy to the lunatic fringe of Jasmine Crockett, Joy Reid, and Zohran Mamdani—have all legitimized double standards while lowering the bar of the once unacceptable. When our careerist left-wing elites seek to divide us by race and make it essential, not incidental, to our identities, that tribalist message filters throughout communities. The ensuing signal is that “payback” violence is okay—on the expectation that there are no consequences for interracial violence—as long as the victim is white and the assaulter is not.

    "fullContent": "Trump Demands Intel CEO \"Must Resign\" Over Alleged China Ties Cited In Senator Cotton's Letter President Trump must have read U.S. Republican Senator Tom Cotton's letter, sent to Intel's Board on Wednesday, about the chipmaker's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan's ties to Chinese firms, and a recent criminal case involving his former company, Cadence Design. That's because Trump just fired off a shocking new Truth Social post moments ago. \"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform. The president continued, \"There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!\" In a letter addressed to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary, Cotton raised the question whether Intel's Board knew about subpoenas issued to Cadence during Tan's tenure, and whether Tan has fully disclosed or divested from Chinese chip firms linked to the Chinese military or Communist Party. Writing to \"express concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security\", Cotton said in the letter. Cotton noted that Tan recently pleaded guilty to illegally transferring sensitive chip design technology to a Chinese military university and semiconductor firm while working at Cadence. Cotton also criticized Intel's decision to hire Tan despite these associations, especially given the company's nearly $8 billion award under the CHIPS Act and its role in the Secure Enclave program, which requires strict compliance with national security protocols. Intel shares are down nearly 4% in premarket trading in New York. Here's the full letter from the GOP Senator: Mr. Frank D. Yeary Chairman of the Board of Directors Intel Corporation 2200 Mission College Blvd Santa Clara, CA 95054 Dear Mr. Yeary: I write to express concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security. In March 2025, Intel appointed Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO. Mr. Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Mr. Tan was most recently the CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a company that makes electronic design automation (EDA) technology, which is a key enabler of advanced chip design. Last week, Cadence pleaded guilty to illegally selling its products to a Chinese military university and transferring its technology to an associated Chinese semiconductor company without obtaining licenses. These illegal activities occurred under Mr. Tan's tenure. Intel was awarded nearly $8 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act, the largest grant to a single company. Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations. Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations. In the interest of transparency and national security, I respectfully request a response to the following questions by August 15, 2025. Was the Board aware of Cadence's subpoenas before hiring Mr. Tan as CEO? If so, what measures were taken to address concerns about Cadence's activities under Mr. Tan? Did the Board require Mr. Tan to divest from his positions in semiconductor firms linked to the Chinese Communist Party or the People's Liberation Army and any other concerning entities in China that could pose a conflict of interest for Intel's CEO? Given Intel's contract under the Secure Enclave program, has Mr. Tan disclosed any remaining investments, professional roles, or other ties to Chinese companies to the U.S. government? Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response. Sincerely, Tom Cotton United States Senator It seems like the 'Red Scare' has begun. And this...

Miran, who has already been confirmed by the Senate before taking over as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors thus speeding up the process, is only expected to serve a term that expires in January, according to the person, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. As such the nomination is expected to fill the short-term void in the seat vacated by Governor Kugler. Trump said Wednesday he would likely nominate a temporary governor to fill the seat, rather than a successor-in-waiting for Jerome Powell, who - let's face it - can't wait for his term to be officially over. The dollar, which was already having a bad session, dumped on the news... ... while gold ... and crypto jumped... ... on expectations that Miran will push for Trump's dovish agenda.

    "fullContent": "Trump Signs EO Easing Access For Crypto, Private Assets In 401k Retirement Plans Update (1545ET): Confirming the earlier rumors, President Trump signed an executive order easing access to private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency and other alternative assets in 401(k)s. The order directs the Labor Department to reevaluate guidance around alternative asset investments in retirement plans and clarify the government's position on fiduciary responsibilities. Trump also required Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer to work with counterparts at the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal regulators to determine whether rule changes should be made to assist in the effort. The SEC is asked to facilitate access to alternative assets for participant-directed retirement plans. This is obviously a major victory for industries looking to tap some of the roughly $12.5 trillion held in those retirement accounts. BTC and ETH are rallying further on the news... * * * US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order that could open the door for cryptocurrencies to be included in 401(k) retirement plans, potentially reshaping how Americans invest their savings. The White House Press Office confirmed to Cointelegraph on Thursday that the order directs the US Labor Department to reevaluate restrictions around alternative assets in defined-contribution plans, including digital assets, private equity and real estate. A senior White House official said the order instructs the Secretary of Labor to clarify the department’s stance on alternative assets and provide guidance on fiduciary processes for offering these types of investments in retirement portfolios. Trump will allow crypto exposure for $12.5 trillion 401(k) market Once implemented, Cointelegraph's Ezra Reguerra reports that the order could grant Americans access to digital assets through their 401(k) plans — part of a $12.5 trillion retirement market and a sought-after opportunity for crypto firms aiming to reach more retail investors. The move would be a significant step forward for the crypto industry, which has long sought broader retail exposure and financial system legitimacy. Despite institutional investors increasing crypto allocations, everyday savers have been restricted due to fiduciary risk, regulatory uncertainty and volatility concerns. The White House official said that Trump’s directive would call for inter-agency coordination with the US Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to explore rule changes that may support the adoption of alternative investments like crypto in retirement products. Bitcoin is rallying this morning on the report... And yesterday saw a reversal of the recent outflows from ETFs... Trump has final say on the executive order On July 18, the Financial Times cited anonymous sources saying that the president is eyeing alternative investments like crypto assets for American 401(k) retirement plans. In a previous statement to Cointelegraph, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that nothing should be deemed official unless it comes from Trump himself. Desai said Trump is committed to restoring prosperity to everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future. “No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself,” Desai said. During a Bloomberg interview, US SEC Chair Paul Atkins said education on the risks associated with crypto as an investment is crucial. Atkins said disclosure is key and that people should be made aware of what they are getting into. He added that he’s looking forward to what the president will do. Earlier this year, the Labor Department rescinded an earlier guidance for crypto in 401(k) plans. On May 28, the Labor Department revoked a 2022 guidance that urged fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” when eyeing crypto for 401(k) retirement plans. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 15:45",
