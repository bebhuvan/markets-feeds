    "fullContent": "Latest Global Nuclear Project Snapshot Shows China Still Dominates Nuclear has been a core investment theme since December 2020, followed by the launch of \"The Next AI Trade\" in April 2024 and the introduction of the \"Powering Up America\" theme shortly thereafter. We expanded our nuclear coverage yesterday as Goldman initiated bullish coverage on Uranium Energy Corp. As a reminder, we first flagged Cameco Corp. as a buy around $9 a share; it's now trading above $78. Goldman's latest nuclear reactor tracker, which charts out global project progress, underscores that a new era of atomic energy is set to come online to help power all things AI in the 2030s. New reactor progress and announcements: North America 7/18/2025 - United States - At an energy summit in Pittsburgh PA, Westinghouse announced plans to start construction of the first of 10 new AP1000 reactors in the US by 2030 (here). 7/29/2025 - United States - The US NRC has approved licensing for the 800MW restart of Palisades Nuclear Plant. Holtec expects the plant to be restarted in the fourth quarter of 2025 (here). 8/7/2025 - United States - The DOE approved the 5th loan disbursement to Holtec to help fund the restart the Palisades Nuclear Plant. The 5th disbursement was for ~$82mn and the loan guarantee to Holtec is for \"up to $1.52bn.\" To date, ~$335mn has been disbursed (here). Europe 7/7/2025 - Belgium - Restart and extended operation of Belgian reactors approved. The Federal Agency for Nuclear Control has approved the restart of unit 3 at Tihange nuclear power plant following a maintenance outage. Doel 4 is scheduled to restart by November 2025 at the latest. Doel 4 and Tihange 2 were the country's last 2 reactors which were scheduled to close in 2025 (here). 7/18/2025 - Bulgaria - Bulgaria partners with Citi for financing of new Kozloduy units. The construction of Units 7 and 8 will be the first reactors in Europe using Westinghouse's AP1000 technology. The goal is to have Unit 7 operational by 2035 and Unit 8 operational by 2038 (here). 7/22/2025 - United Kingdom - UK Energy Secretary signed a FID for Sizewell C nuclear power plant in England. The government confirmed it will take a 44.9% stake in the project. The plan for Sizewill C is to build 2 EPR reactors producing a total of 3.2GW of electricity for at least 60 years. This is set to be the first new nuclear construction project in the UK in decades (here). 7/29/2025 - Slovakia - Slovakia has moved forward with plans to build a nuclear plant (costs estimated at €13-15bn) in partnership with the US company Westinghouse. The intergovernmental deal signed with the US has already been finalized however the deal does not technically oblige Slovakia to choose Westinghouse. A construction contract is expected in 2027, pending feasibility studies (here). Asia 7/22/2025 - Japan - Japan is reportedly conducting surveys for its first nuclear power plant location since Fukushima incident (here). 8/1/2025 - Kazakhstan - China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has now secured a contract to lead the construction of a third nuclear facility in Kazakhstan. Earlier in the year (June 2025) Russia's Rosatom was selected to build the first nuclear facility in Kazakhstan while CNNC has been selected to build the second and third facility (here). 8/7/2025 - India - India laid out key features of its nuclear energy strategy with the goal of achieving 100GW of nuclear capacity by 2047. The government noted Gorakhpur 1 and 2 are expected to be completed by 2031-2032. The government describes these as under construction, however the PRIS database does not consider these as under construction until the first major placing of concrete (here). 8/8/2025 - China - The China National Nuclear Safety Administration issued a construction license on Friday, August 8th for units 1 and 2 at the Jinqimen nuclear power plant. The construction of the two, Hualong One reactors, was approved on December 29th, 2023 with the ground breaking ceremony held in February 2024. The current license now allows first concrete to be poured for the foundation of the reactor (here). Latest reactors connected to power grids. China dominates the reactor pipeline. Global reactors under construction (years under construction). Chinese reactors under construction (years under construction). A separate Goldman note outlines that the coming uranium supply deficit is set to explode.

    "fullContent": "Over 20,000 Arrested In Iran On Suspicion Of Espionage During War With Israel Via The Cradle Iranian police arrested around 21,000 people on various charges during the 12-day war with Israel, Iran's national police force reported on Tuesday. According to local media, more than 7,850 public tips were received during the fighting, leading to the arrests. The spokesperson of the Iranian police, Saed Montazer al-Mahdi, noted that the Iranian Cyber Police (FATA) handled 5,700 cybercrime cases, including internet fraud, unauthorized withdrawals, and a cyber attack on the Nobitex exchange. Via Associated Press He said 2,774 “illegal citizens” were detained, with 261 people arrested on suspicion of espionage and 172 detained for unauthorized filming – some for filming “sensitive centers” around the country. Examinations of the suspects' mobile phones led to the opening of 30 special security cases. Speaking on the Evin Prison incident, Mahdi stated that police arrested 127 “security and political” inmates during an escape attempt, including two of whom were dressed in firefighter uniforms. Fars News Agency reported on July 25 that more than 700 people had been detained over the previous 12 days on charges of “security cooperation with Israel.” Separately, judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir said on 22 July that 75 prisoners escaped during an Israeli missile strike on Evin Prison. According to Shargh Media Group, Iranian Minister of Intelligence Ismail Khatib said, “The intelligence and security organizations have the resources [personnel, assets, and operational capabilities] to mobilize them both internally and within the regime itself. During the imposed 12-day war, we witnessed seven million public reports.” He added, “We hope that as this unity has been the axis of destroying all influence, hostility, conspiracy, and sedition, we will all be able to protect this unity and cohesion.” During the June war, Israel launched coordinated attacks inside Iran, killing senior military and intelligence officials, nuclear scientists, and striking key military sites and administrative infrastructure. Analysts speculate that the purpose of striking administrative buildings and infrastructure is to weaken the Iranian government's grip and control over its border provinces with the hope of seeding unrest and separatist movements. Both during and after the war, Iranian security forces seized large caches of explosives, drones, and weapons, along with workshops used for manufacturing unmanned systems from within the country itself. Since then, the hunt for infiltrating agents has continued across the country, with leaders urging citizens to “maintain their vigilance, as they showed during the war.” Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 22:35",

    "fullContent": "The Boomer Mirage Authored by Josh Stylman via Substack, One Chart. Three Generations. Total Extraction. I saw this chart making the rounds on Twitter this week, and it stopped me cold. While the specific figures combine data from multiple sources, the trend is undeniable: in 1950, over half of 30-year-olds were married homeowners. By 2025, some analysts project that number as low as 13%. That's not a societal transformation. It's not an economic fluke. It's the visible outcome of an invisible strategy—one that extracted everything it could from a three-generation arc and left only illusions in its place. They'll tell you people just choose differently now—that marriage rates fell because of changing values. But people can't choose what they can't afford. When the economic foundation for family formation disappears, cultural changes follow inevitably. That chart doesn't show us changing values or new priorities. It shows systemic breakdown, disguised for decades as freedom. It maps the slow evaporation of the social contract. For one generation, adulthood was a starting point. For the next, a struggle. For the latest, an abstraction—marketed endlessly but almost never attained. What began as a rite of passage has become a paywalled simulation. The post–World War II boom was never sustainable. In hindsight, this was obvious. It relied on conditions that were always time-limited: cheap energy from newly tapped oil fields, industrial monopolies before globalization kicked in, dollar hegemony that exported inflation globally, and a demographic pyramid with more workers than retirees. It was a golden window, not a golden age. And when the window closed, the illusion had to be maintained—through leverage, narrative, and ever-increasing sacrifice from the generations that followed. The math quietly stopped working. Boomers bought homes for two or three times their annual income during an era when interest rates would fall for the next four decades—turning their mortgages into wealth-building machines as rates dropped from 15% to near-zero. Today's buyers face five to six times their income—or more in major cities—while rates can only go up from historic lows. Where Boomers rode a 40-year tailwind of falling borrowing costs that inflated their assets while deflated their debt, current generations face headwinds at every turn. The Federal Reserve data confirms this unprecedented decline, showing rates falling from over 18% in the early 1980s to near 2.6% by 2021. The housing market itself tells the story: recent data shows over 500,000 more sellers than buyers - not because homes are affordable, but because an entire generation has been systematically priced out. The institutions that promised stability—education, government, media, finance—mutated into extraction machines. Still speaking the old language, they now served a different purpose: to keep people compliant inside a system that no longer offered a way out. This wasn't merely economic. It was existential. The foundations of meaning—family, ownership, stability—were quietly downgraded to lifestyle preferences, and then systematically priced out. People without homes are easier to relocate. People without families are easier to isolate. People without rootedness are easier to govern. The Boomers didn't design the con, but they lived in its payout phase. They received land, pensions, and a functional society. Many still believe they earned it, unable to recognize how thoroughly their reality was engineered from the start. Their children were left trying to replicate a model that no longer existed. Their grandchildren have grown up in the wreckage, wondering why their competence and effort never translate into traction. This didn't happen by accident. As I've documented in The Technocratic Blueprint, we're witnessing the culmination of a century-long plan—a sophisticated pump and dump scheme where the bill is finally coming due. The architecture for this extraction has deep historical roots, dating back to systematic changes in how America was governed and how citizens were legally classified. What followed was a long, slow harvest of the population—one that disguised control as progress, debt as opportunity, and collapse as evolution. The postwar boom didn't contradict that system—it lubricated it. Now, the mirage is gone. What was once promised can no longer be afforded. The institutions that upheld the illusion are spent. They extract, but no longer inspire. They preach equity while enforcing dependence. They sell empowerment while removing agency. And still, they insist the dream is alive. But here's where the extraction becomes truly sophisticated. As the traditional American Dream died, a new form of participation emerged: digital membership in what amounts to a global dollar club. As KF recently explained in his analysis of the GENIUS Act, stablecoins—digital bank accounts disguised as innovation—have exploded to serve 400 million users globally while generating massive profits for their issuers. The trade-off is stark. Boomers got real assets with relative transactional privacy. The next generation gets digital \"assets\"—stablecoin wallets, app-based banking, algorithmic financial services—in exchange for comprehensive surveillance. What looks like financial inclusion is actually the infrastructure for total economic monitoring. This represents the systematic replacement of real value with declared value across every domain. America has become a \"club promoter\" for the global dollar system, offering relaxed entry requirements that have drawn hundreds of billions into U.S. treasury-backed stablecoins. Users get access to \"dollar-denominated wealth\" through stablecoins that pay them no interest while the issuers pocket billions from the treasury yields. It's the same extraction model that's been systematically engineered through culture and media for decades, just scaled globally and digitized. Experts in these systems, like Aaron Day, warn this represents a \"backdoor CBDC\"—applying existing financial surveillance laws to what was previously private money. The surveillance trade-off is particularly insidious. In the short term, these systems offer less monitoring than traditional banks—no extensive paperwork, minimal identity verification. But once everyone is locked into the digital infrastructure, America can impose far stricter controls than ever before. Every transaction becomes trackable, every account becomes freezable, every economic participant becomes manageable. We're witnessing the replacement of physical ownership with digital access—and calling it progress. Where Boomers built equity in homes, the next generation builds balances in accounts that can be monitored, modified, or eliminated with keystrokes. But charts don't lie. That one chart—the brutal slope from 52% to 13%—says what no institution will admit: the old system is dead. It wasn't lost. It was liquidated—and we were the product. What gets built in its place remains an open question. The GENIUS Act's full-reserve model could enable either unprecedented control—or the first real challenge to fractional-reserve banking in a century. But as Catherine Austin Fitts has pointed out, the Act contains no protections against programmable money, potentially creating private CBDCs with even less oversight than government-issued digital currency. As she explains, 'the issuing is not centralized, it's dispersed. But if you look at the control mechanism of a social credit system and we know the federal government is doing remarkable things to pull together all the data they need to do a social credit system controlled by private corporations, tech companies, essentially.' The outcome isn't predetermined—it's being decided right now. The good news is that once the spell breaks, you stop trying to win the rigged game. You stop competing for scraps and start building something real. Not a nostalgic replica of a world that's gone—but a new structure, grounded in truth, agency, and actual sovereignty. The chart that documents the death of the old dream becomes the blueprint for something better—if we're honest enough to read what it's really telling us. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 21:45",
