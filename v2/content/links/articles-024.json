    "fullContent": "How Coca-Cola's Secret Formula Has Changed Over Time Coca-Cola debuted in 1886 as a pharmacy fountain drink. Its original syrup drew on coca leaves and kola nuts for stimulation and flavor. Over time, the recipe changed alongside regulations, technology, and tastes. In the following chart, Visual Capitalist's Bruno Venditti pairs a quick dataset with context on how ingredients and nutrition have evolved. The ingredient and nutrition snapshot for today’s U.S. Coca-Cola comes from Coca-Cola. From Coca to “Decocainized” Coca Early formulas included coca leaf extract, and small amounts of cocaine remained until the early 1900s. By 1903, the drug was removed amid changing laws and public health concerns. Coca-leaf flavoring persisted in “decocainized” form, prepared under license in the U.S. by a facility now operated by Stepan Company. These shifts preserved the brand’s flavor profile while complying with evolving regulation. The Big Sweetener Switch In the U.S., Coca-Cola transitioned from cane sugar to high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) during the 1980s, with reporting in 1984 noting the move across major soda brands. Cost and supply dynamics favored corn syrup at the time. Not every market followed: in the U.K., for instance, Coca-Cola Original lists “sugar” rather than HFCS. This split explains why “Mexican Coke” tastes different to some consumers. “I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using real cane sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so… It’s just better!” - Donald Trump U.S. Coke has six standard ingredients: carbonated water, HFCS, caramel color, phosphoric acid, natural flavors, and caffeine. A 20 fl oz (591 mL) bottle has ~240 calories, ~65 g added sugar, and ~75 mg sodium, though labels can vary. Because the 1886 recipe is proprietary and not publicly released, a direct comparison isn’t possible. Following Trump’s push, Coca-Cola has announced it will launch a new product sweetened with U.S.-produced cane sugar next fall.

    "fullContent": "Germany's Industrial Core Is Collapsing Under The US Trade Deal And The Green Agenda Submitted by Thomas Kolbe The asymmetrical trade agreement between the EU and the US will further worsen Germany’s recession. Yet neither politicians nor corporate leaders show any willingness to make the sweeping policy changes needed to reverse course. Germany’s economic data leaves no room for illusions. After contracting by 0.9% in 2023 and another 0.5% last year, the decline will continue this year. The Machine Room Has Been Blown Apart It is precisely the sectors that have sustained German prosperity for decades—automobiles, construction, machinery—that are under the heaviest pressure. Without the artificial boost from state spending—now accounting for half of GDP—the private sector is set to shrink by 4–5% this year. Since 2018, total productivity has been in steady decline. This is also a social problem: Germany is importing hundreds of thousands of welfare migrants into its social systems, yet the economy would have to boom just to keep per capita prosperity from falling. A new survey by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) confirms what was already obvious: the EU–US trade deal will especially hurt Germany’s export-oriented economy. According to the survey, 58% of companies expect additional burdens, rising to 74% for firms with direct US business. Only 5% expect any benefit. “This deal may have been politically necessary, but for many German companies it’s a bitter pill,” said DIHK CEO Helena Melnikov. “Higher tariffs, more bureaucracy, falling competitiveness”—that’s the price of the diplomatic truce between Washington and Brussels. As of Thursday, a general 15% tariff applies to exports to the US, hitting automotive and machinery manufacturers hardest. 89% of US-oriented firms report immediate disadvantages, 72% fear further tariff hikes, 80% worry about political arbitrariness in transatlantic trade, and more than half plan to scale back US operations. Business Was Already Weak In its May survey of over 21,000 companies, only 23% reported positive business expectations—down five points—while 30% expected deterioration. In industry, one in three anticipates fewer orders. Just 19% plan to increase investment, while about a third plan to cut back. High energy prices, labor shortages, and political uncertainty are seen as the main drags. The DIHK forecasts a 0.3% recession for 2025, but adjusting for state spending, the real decline is closer to 4–5%. Daily surveys confirm the same message: Germany is being deindustrialized, losing hundreds of thousands of core-sector jobs. The social security deficits already emerging are just the beginning. Yet both politics and business refuse to conduct an honest diagnosis. The Green Deal remains sacrosanct. Energy costs for German industry are up to three times higher than for US competitors, double that of French firms—pushing energy-intensive sectors out of the country. Dancing Around the Golden Calf Nobody dares openly challenge Brussels’ climate agenda. A rare exception came in June, when a group of works council representatives wrote an open letter to the Chancellor, naming the Green Deal as a root cause of decline. But most CEOs dodge the question. Mercedes-Benz chief Ola Källenius cites “weak demand, high production costs, and US tariff uncertainty” for falling margins—but ignores the Green Deal’s role. VW CEO Oliver Blume calls for lower energy prices and tax incentives for EVs—essentially more subsidies to keep the transition alive. Corporate leadership is now fused ideologically with the Green Deal. The energy transition has battered Germany’s industrial base: sectors like construction and automotive have been knocked completely off track. A Split Economy Events like the “Made for Germany” coffee chat between 61 CEOs and the Chancellor are symbolic of a corporatist mindset. Large corporations can adjust or relocate production to sidestep regulation, but small and medium-sized enterprises—the Mittelstand—are being crushed. The Green Deal’s bureaucratic weight ultimately clears the field for big corporations by eliminating smaller competitors. The Mittelstand has no political backing, and many are fighting daily for survival—often ending in bankruptcy. In H1 2025, insolvencies rose 9.4% year-on-year to 11,900 companies. There is still no sign of a policy shift on climate. The German corporate elite has failed to seize the initiative to force political change. Germany is heading for a hot autumn—economically and socially. * * * About the author: Thomas Kolbe, a German graduate economist, has worked for over 25 years as a journalist and media producer for clients from various industries and business associations.
