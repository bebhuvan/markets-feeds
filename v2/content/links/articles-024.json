    "fullContent": "Southern States Have The Lowest Average Incomes, DC The Highest Personal income levels across the U.S. vary widely, shaped by differences in industries, costs of living, and economic growth. This map lists states by their per capita personal income, showing where residents, on average, earn the most. The data, via Visual Capitalist's Pallavi Rao, for this visualization comes from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, compiled by StatsAmerica. These figures include pre-tax earnings from: wages, insurance & government business & rental income, interest, and dividends, unadjusted for living costs. It does not include capital gains from selling stock. Ranked: U.S. States With the Highest Income in 2024 Washington, D.C. holds the highest per capita personal income in the nation at $108,233, boosted by a concentration of high-paying government, legal, and consulting jobs. Rank State Code Per Capita Personal Income (2024) 1 DC DC $108,233 2 Massachusetts MA $93,927 3 Connecticut CT $93,235 4 Wyoming WY $85,945 5 New York NY $85,733 6 California CA $85,518 7 New Jersey NJ $84,071 8 Washington WA $83,938 9 New Hampshire NH $82,878 10 Colorado CO $82,705 11 Maryland MD $78,538 12 Virginia VA $77,093 13 Alaska AK $75,247 14 Minnesota MN $74,943 15 Illinois IL $74,197 16 South Dakota SD $73,959 17 Nebraska NE $71,859 18 Pennsylvania PA $71,148 19 North Dakota ND $70,966 20 Oregon OR $70,685 21 Florida FL $70,390 22 Vermont VT $70,086 23 Rhode Island RI $69,936 24 Hawaii HI $69,520 25 Delaware DE $69,282 26 Nevada NV $68,657 27 Maine ME $68,129 28 Kansas KS $68,038 29 Texas TX $67,942 30 Montana MT $67,615 31 Wisconsin WI $67,586 32 Utah UT $66,443 33 Tennessee TN $64,908 34 North Carolina NC $64,855 35 Missouri MO $64,740 36 Arizona AZ $64,456 37 Ohio OH $64,225 38 Indiana IN $63,802 39 Iowa IA $63,573 40 Michigan MI $63,221 41 Oklahoma OK $62,661 42 Georgia GA $62,393 43 Idaho ID $61,836 44 Louisiana LA $61,332 45 South Carolina SC $59,995 46 Arkansas AR $59,663 47 New Mexico NM $57,652 48 Kentucky KY $57,526 49 Alabama AL $56,684 50 West Virginia WV $55,138 51 Mississippi MS $52,017 Massachusetts follows at $93,927, powered by its robust education, healthcare, and tech sectors. Connecticut, with its strong finance and insurance industries, comes in third at $93,235. All three leaders are at nearly twice the income last-ranked Mississippi ($52,017), reflecting the impact of specialized, high-skill industries on local income levels. Meanwhile, New York ($85,733), New Jersey ($84,071), and New Hampshire ($82,878) keep the broader Northeast near the top of the distribution. America’s West: The Tech Juggernaut California ($85,518) and Washington ($83,938) both place in the top 10 states by income. Their high incomes are linked to thriving technology and innovation economies, with major employers like Apple, Microsoft, and Google anchoring the regions. These states also attract high-skilled migrants, further boosting wage levels. American South Incomes Still Underperform The bottom of the ranking is dominated by Southern states, with Mississippi at $52,017 and West Virginia at $55,138. Lower wages, coupled with economies centered on agriculture and lower-wage manufacturing, contribute to these figures. These same states also have a higher rate of poverty, but also a lower cost of living.

    "fullContent": "Knife Crime In Germany Surges, With Foreigners Heavily Over-Represented In Latest Figures Authored by Thomas Brooke via Remix News, The number of violent knife crimes in Germany has risen sharply once again, with newly released Federal Police figures confirming a worsening trend. In the first half of 2025, 730 cases were recorded under Federal Police jurisdiction, a 17 percent increase compared to the same period last year. The data, provided by the German government in response to a parliamentary query from Alternative for Germany (AfD) domestic affairs spokesman Martin Hess and obtained by Junge Freiheit, show a marked overrepresentation of foreign suspects. Out of the recorded offenses, 278 involved German suspects and 270 involved non-Germans. While foreigners make up just under 15 percent of Germany’s population, they accounted for over 36 percent of knife crime suspects. Among them, Syrians formed the largest group with 29 cases, followed by Afghans with 23 and Poles with 20. Algerian and Afghan suspects were among the most likely to use a knife rather than merely carry one, with 83 percent of cases involving actual use. The Federal Police recorded the majority of incidents at train stations, with 409 cases. Hess said the figures were “largely a direct consequence of mass migration,” accusing left-wing parties of “denial of reality” and warning that public spaces must not become “places of fear.” He criticized symbolic measures such as weapon-free zones and said that effective border controls and large-scale deportations had yet to be implemented. Knife violence is not confined to Berlin, though the capital’s police force drew ridicule last year for website advice suggesting that victims sing loudly to deter attackers — a tip later removed after public backlash. In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, knife crime rose 20.7 percent in 2024, following a 44 percent jump the previous year. There, foreigners make up just 16.1 percent of the population but 47.6 percent of knife crime suspects. In May, German criminal lawyer Udo Vetter warned that the country has “imported knife violence” following several high-profile incidents, including a Kosovar man injuring a 12-year-old girl and two others, a Syrian asylum seeker stabbing five people outside a student bar, and a rioter wounding a police officer. He pointed to cultural norms where knives are carried as status symbols. Manuel Ostermann of the Federal Police Union also called for urgent action, warning that the knife “always immediately poses a concrete threat to life and limb” and that politicians must use all available measures to curb the trend.

    "fullContent": "Visualizing The World's AI Compute Hubs Today, global AI computing resources are clearly concentrated in the U.S. and China. Together, the two countries host 50 of the world’s 132 AI accelerator-enabled cloud regions. Given rising demand for AI systems, several countries are ramping up investment in local AI infrastructure, much of this in partnership with Nvidia. This graphic, via Visual Capitalist's Dorothy Neufeld, shows AI computing hubs by country, based on data from the University of Oxford. Ranked: AI Computing Clusters by Country Below, we show the number of AI accelerator-enabled cloud regions by country: Today, the U.S. and China are the only countries globally with AI accelerators—specialized chips like Nvidia GPUs—from domestic suppliers. In fact, over 95% of the world’s AI accelerators are powered by U.S. chipmakers. As a result “compute sovereignty” is highly uneven globally, with the vast majority of nations having no AI infrastructure at all. More recently, the European Commission slotted $23 billion for creating five AI gigafactories. Meanwhile, the UAE is investing $1.4 trillion in AI infrastructure to drive economic transformation. Overall, Nvidia says that 20 countries so far are expressing interest in AI sovereignty initiatives, including France, Germany, and Indonesia. To learn more about this topic from a revenue perspective, check out this graphic on how Nvidia makes its billions. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 05:45",
