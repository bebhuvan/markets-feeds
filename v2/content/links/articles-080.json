    "summary": "- by New Deal democratMy “Weekly Indicators” post is up at Seeking Alpha.Despite the warning signs in some of the recent monthly data that I’ve highlighted in the past several weeks, the high frequency data this past week indicated smooth sailing, at least for now.Some of that is likely due to the 4th of July being one week ago, so some consumer data in particular rebounded. But at least one indicator - the S&P 500 making another new all-time high on Thursday - I suspect is due to absolute complacency; namely, the TACO trade. Wall Street must believe that T—-p is going to chicken out again w/r/t his new tariff announcements.In any event, clicking over and reading will as usual bring you up to the virtual moment as to the state of the economy, and reward me a little bit for collecting and organizing it for you.",

    "summary": "We study the design of market information in competing-mechanism games. We identify a new dimension, private disclosures, whereby the principals asymmetrically inform the agents of how their mechanisms operate. We show that private disclosures have two important effects. First, they can raise a principal's payoff guarantee against her competitors' threats. Second, they can support equilibrium outcomes and payoffs that cannot be supported with standard mechanisms. These results call for a novel approach to competing mechanisms, which we develop to identify a canonical game and a canonical class of equilibria, thereby establishing a new revelation principle for this class of environments.",

    "summary": "- by New Deal democratOur data drought won’t end until next Tuesday. In the meantime, let me follow up on a theme from my analysis of the economic data from last week. To wit: there are several metrics that I have already stated are worth a “recession watch;” namely, housing units under construction (down almost 20% from peak), and the 3 month economically weighted ISM new orders subindexes (just into contraction territory at 49.3). Additionally, real aggregate nonsupervisory payrolls look like they may be rolling over. But there are many other measures that are not signaling a recession in the immediate near term (e.g, employment in the goods producing sector).As I noted several weeks ago, in the past 50+ years, in addition to COVID, almost always there has been a domestic political or geopolitical shock that has precipitated US recessions.

Broader use of foreign currency-denominated stablecoins could raise concerns about monetary sovereignty and, in some jurisdictions, erode the effectiveness of existing foreign exchange regulations. The principle of \"same risks, same regulation\" faces limitations in the context of stablecoins, highlighting the need for tailored regulatory approaches that address the nature and specific features of stablecoins.",

First, using customs and firm-to-firm transaction data that covers the universe of firms in Chile, we build the fossil fuel consumption and the direct CO2 emissions at the firm, sectoral, and aggregate levels. In line with the official national sources, the electricity generation sector is the most important contributor to aggregate CO2 emissions, followed by the manufacturing, transport, and mining sectors. Then, we study the role of input-output linkages in propagating CO2 emissions to the rest of the economy. To do so, we construct the production network and the carbon footprint at the firm level using firm-to-firm transaction data from the Chilean IRS, and we validate our results with the input-output tables approach used in th",
