    "summary": "There's something happening to the upper middle class in the United States that no one is talking about. They are going through an existential crisis. I first noticed it at the airport. A line 20 people deep for the American Express lounge. Then, once you get inside, more lines for food/drinks and not an open chair in sight. Then I saw it in the housing market. I have friends with $10,000+ monthly mortgage payments on modest homes. Ten grand a month and they still don't own a mansion. Today, buying a 3-bedroom apartment in Jersey City (where I live) would cost me anywhere from $9,300-$14,000 a month (all-in). I could rent the same unit for around $6,000-$7,000 a month. Lastly, I saw it when I went on vacation to the Bahamas. I was told that Baha Mar was the place to go. It's an expensive resort that has a waterpark, casino, and lots of dining options. The only problem? There isn't enough space for everyone to enjoy everything. If you don't book ahead, good luck getting a reservation at",

    "summary": "We study whether Algorithmic Market Makers using Q-learning produce competitive or supra-competitive prices in a quote-driven asset market. We show, through simulations and analytically, that the result depends on the way the algorithm is set up. A basic Q-learning algorithm leads to loss-free prices and is, therefore, not fit for trade. Carefully choosing the exploration and learning parameters leads to less extreme prices, but still far away from the competitive ones. When we endow the algorithm with a basic understanding of the market and basic information about outstanding quotes, the Q-learning algorithms produce competitive prices.",

    "summary": "How does the expansion of commodity export production impact the skill premium in a developing colonial economy? In this paper, we examine this question by relating sugar and coffee production – two key exports – to the relative wage of skilled to unskilled workers in early twentieth-century Java, Indonesia. Drawing on a newly-constructed dataset of regionally-disaggregated production figures and wages, we find a positive relationship between sugar production and the skill premium, but no relationship between coffee production and the skill premium. Using several instruments exploiting exogenous variation in global market prices and local production suitability, we find evidence for a causal effect of sugar production on the skill premium. Specifically, we estimate that a 10% increase in sugar production boosted the skill premium by about 10-11%. A substantial amount of skilled labour was involved in commodity production processes, in particular that of sugar, but there was a general s",

    "summary": "Rational individuals who obtain a premium by passing an imprecise test change their choice of costly competence when the pass threshold varies. At given premium that reaction prevents variation of the failure rate completely if the marginal cost of competence is constant, only partially if it is increasing. The offsetting effect of endogenous competence is stronger when the pass premium varies in the same direction as the threshold, as it plausibly does when in equilibrium it depends on the expected competence differential between otherwise unobservably heterogeneous individuals who pass and fail. Failure rates remain very similar as different thresholds elicit different endogenous competence, and depend much more strongly on the test's precision: the outcome of a frequently failed test must be very random from the point of view of those who take it.",

We identify two key effects of AI improvement: A freeriding effect raises worker rents by increasing the probability of successful investment when the worker shirks; A capital reallocation effect shifts investment toward workers with higher or lower rents, depending on which tasks AI improves. Contrary to standard predictions, AI can raise both worker rents and labor demand. We derive implications for capital allocation, labor demand, compensation, and welfare.",

    "summary": "Do trade dependencies leave countries vulnerable to geopolitical coercion? We study the economic costs of trade and financial sanctions, from 1920 to the present. We first develop a continuous measure of sanction intensity, using bilateral commodity-level data to calculate the importance of specific flows that fall under sanctions. We find that sanctions inflict relatively small costs on average: sanctioning 1% of GDP worth of imports or exports leads to approximately 0.3 percentage points of lost GDP over a 5-year period and a 0.1 percentage point increase in unemployment. However, we show that sanctions are far more costly for countries whose trade is highly concentrated, and for countries that rely heavily on exporting primary commodities. Low income and developing countries appear most vulnerable to trade sanctions, while high income financial centers and some EU countries are among the most exposed to financial sanctions.",
