    "fullContent": "Putin Hails 'Heroic' North Korean Troops In Warm Letter To Kim Russian President Vladimir Putin has praised North Korean troops deployed as part of the Ukraine war as \"heroic\" in a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, North Korean state media has revealed Friday. The timing of the letter's revelation is interesting, given that President Putin is currently in Anchorage, Alaska - hours away from meeting with President Donald Trump and the US delegation to talk all things Ukraine war and its resolution. Is this a bit of a troll move by Pyongyang? Via The Associated Press The Putin letter also commemorated Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule, with Putin recalling the joint efforts of Soviet and Korean forces during World War II. He hailed those wartime bonds of \"military friendship and mutual assistance\" and compared them to today, where DPRK troops are deployed in support of Russian forces, reportedly in the Kursk region and possibly even within eastern Ukraine itself. Reports stretching back to last year suggest over ten thousand North Korean troops are there, and possibly more cycling through. In particular Putin highlighted the Korean troop sacrifice to secure the Kursk region as \"heroic\" and said the Russian people would always remember their bravery, according to the state-run KCNA news agency. \"This was fully proved by the heroic participation of the DPRK soldiers in liberating the territory of Kursk region from the Ukrainian occupationists,\" he said The Russian leader also emphasized the two countries' work toward creating a stronger \"multipolar global order\". According to more context via The Guardian: About 600 North Korean soldiers have been killed and thousands more wounded fighting for Russia, Seoul has said. South Korea’s intelligence agency said in June that North Korea was potentially ready to send more troops to Russia. The letter was delivered by the chair of Russia’s Duma – Vyacheslav Volodin – who met Kim during an official visit to Pyongyang on Thursday. Volodin thanked Kim for “dispatching excellent soldiers to the Kursk liberation operations for driving out the Ukrainian aggressors”, according to KCNA. ❗️ Putin CALLS North Korea’s Kim Jong Un DAYS before Trump summit Shares info ahead of talks Leaders agree on MORE direct contact Russian President ‘HIGHLY appreciates’ Pyongyang’s support in liberation of Kursk region from Ukrainian forces https://t.co/a791S16jDF pic.twitter.com/PwlDXg9jjZ — RT (@RT_com) August 12, 2025 Earlier this summer, in July, North Korea's state-run media aired footage showing leader Kim Jong-un mourning the deaths of North Korean soldiers said to be killed while fighting in Russia's war in Ukraine as part of allied forces. The occasion for the memorial footage was the return of the soldiers' remains from Russia, though no details were given as to the number of the deceased being remembered. But the event was significant, offering high-level confirmation of troop deaths related to the Ukraine war. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 14:45",

    "fullContent": "MSNBC Mouthpiece Claims Climate Change Is More Dangerous Than Crime In D.C. Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, An MSNBC talking head claimed Tuesday that climate change is more of a threat in Washington D.C. than crime. Commenting on President Trump’s decision to deploy the National Guard to the capital and federalise some policing, Anand Giridharadas claimed it’s all an authoritarian take over and that crime isn’t a big issue. “Crime is real. It is blown out of proportion. People are feeling much more unsafe than they statistically are—but the feeling matters. People deserve to be safe, but they also deserve to feel safe,” Giridharadas blathered. MSNBC's @Anandwrites: \"When I go to D.C., I’m not afraid of losing my wallet so much as I’m afraid of losing my vote. I’m not afraid of losing my wallet so much as I’m afraid that my children’s freedom to breathe will be stolen in a world where climate change policy is… pic.twitter.com/SR8y91lw7t — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) August 12, 2025 He continued, “I think it is true that Democrats have sometimes ignored or lectured people, holding a spreadsheet of statistics. That said, it’s really important to be clear about what is going on here: a relatively small crime problem is being used for specific authoritarian purposes that we know and understand.” “Let’s be clear—D.C. does have one really big crime problem, which was the January 6th insurrection incited by the current president of the United States,” he continued adding “His first act in coming back was pardoning all the people who tried to overturn constitutional order in Washington, D.C.” “When I go to D.C., I’m not afraid of losing my wallet so much as I’m afraid of losing my vote,” the pundit further remarked. “I’m not afraid of losing my wallet so much as I’m afraid that my children’s freedom to breathe will be stolen in a world where climate change policy is nonexistent,” Giridharadas crowed. “I’m afraid that the future of middle-class people will be stolen by the very things you were talking about cutting—the safety net, Medicaid, rural hospitals,” he further waffled.

When I lived in DC, someone once broke the window of my car and stole my umbrella because it was raining. That's the utter disregard some people have for others.

It's hard to measure the level of hypocrisy in his commentary. — Jason Sesler (@jmsesler) August 13, 2025 Nothing screams out of touch more than a bunch of media elites telling the “common” people that they’re much safer than they think. Don’t believe your own experiences — believe us. @MSNBC gaslighting is what they do. — Russ Walker (@RWalkerFW) August 12, 2025 This was all on Morning Joe, the show on which host Joe Scarborough earlier admitted crime is a massive problem in the city. Joe Scarborough reads a text from a \"very liberal\" friend who lives in D.C.: \"I'm not totally opposed to Trump's National Guard move in D.C… crime remains rampant.

    "fullContent": "Senators Call For Probe Into Meta After News Report On AI Conversations With Children Authored by Jacob Burg via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Two Republican Senators on Aug. 14 called for a congressional investigation into Meta Platforms, Facebook’s parent company, after a recent news media report revealed an internal policy document that allowed the company’s chatbots to have “romantic or sensual” conversations with a child. The offices of Meta in Menlo Park, Calif., on July 31, 2025. John Fredricks/The Epoch Times On Thursday, Reuters reported that it had viewed a Meta policy document detailing polices on chatbot behavior that permitted the technology to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” generate incorrect medical information, and assist users in arguing that black people are “dumber than white people.” While Meta confirmed the authenticity of the document, the company said that after recently receiving questions from Reuters, it removed the portions stating that the chatbot is allowed to flirt or participate in romantic roleplay with children. Andy Stone, a spokesperson for Meta, said the company is currently revising the documents and that those types of conversations with children should never have been permitted. “The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed,” Stone told Reuters. “We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors.” On the X platform, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) criticized the company for allegedly only making the changes after being questioned by Reuters. “So, only after Meta got CAUGHT did it retract portions of its company doc that deemed it ‘permissible for chatbots to flirt and engage in romantic roleplay with children,’” Hawley said. “This is grounds for an immediate congressional investigation.” A spokesperson for Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said she supports a probe into Meta. After Hawley called for an investigation, a Meta spokesperson reiterated the company’s previous statement. However, the spokesperson declined to comment on Hawley’s remarks. Blackburn said the report underscores the need to pass reforms for better protection of children online, like the Kids Online Safety Act. The senator co-sponsored the bill, which passed in the Senate last year by a bipartisan 91–3 vote, but failed in the House. The bill called for certain platforms, such as social media networks, to “take reasonable measures in the design and operation of products or services used by minors to prevent and mitigate certain harms that may arise from that use (e.g., sexual exploitation and online bullying).” “Additionally, covered platforms must provide (1) minors with certain safeguards, such as settings that restrict access to minors’ personal data; and (2) parents or guardians with tools to supervise minors’ use of a platform, such as control of privacy and account settings,” the bill states. Blackburn reintroduced the Kids Online Safety Act in May. “When it comes to protecting precious children online, Meta has failed miserably by every possible measure. Even worse, the company has turned a blind eye to the devastating consequences of how its platforms are designed,” Blackburn said. The legislation would also explicitly define a “duty of care” that social media companies employ regarding minors’ use of their products, focusing on the regulation of the companies and the platforms’ designs. The Meta document states that the standards in question do not necessarily reflect “ideal or even preferable” generative AI outputs, according to Reuters. However, the provocative outputs by bots have been permitted, the news outlet’s analysis revealed. The Epoch Times has not independently verified the document in question. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) called the standards “deeply disturbing and wrong.” He said Section 230, the law that protects internet companies from liability for statements or content posted on their platforms, should not extend to shielding the companies’ generative AI chatbots. “Meta and Zuckerberg should be held fully responsible for any harm these bots cause,” Wyden said. Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said Reuters’s report “shows how critical safeguards are for AI—especially when the health and safety of kids is at risk.” Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 13:45",

    "fullContent": "Trump Eyes Using Chips Act Cash To Fund Equity Stake In Intel The Trump administration is exploring using US Chips Act money to take an equity stake in Intel Corp., according to people familiar with the matter — an unusual move aimed at rescuing the struggling chipmaker and bolstering domestic semiconductor production, according to Bloomberg. Talks center on using Chips Act funding to partially finance the purchase, though options are still in early discussion, the people said. It’s unclear whether the stake would come from converting existing Intel grants, allocating new funding, or combining Chips Act money with other sources. Bloomberg first reported the deliberations, which helped spark a 15% rally in Intel shares over the past two days. The company declined to comment, but said in a statement it is “deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership.” Bloomberg writes that Intel has already been awarded $7.9 billion in Chips Act grants for commercial production, up to $3 billion for the Pentagon’s Secure Enclave program, and access to $11 billion in loans. Any new agreement would strengthen the company’s finances as it slashes spending and jobs. The talks come days after Trump met with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, whom he had previously called “highly conflicted” over ties to China. The two appeared to patch things up; Trump later said Tan has an “amazing story.” The approach mirrors other Trump-era interventions, including a “golden share” in US Steel Corp. and a $400 million Pentagon stake in MP Materials Corp. “In the past few months, we’ve seen the government take a much more active role in engaging the economy,” said Geoffrey Gertz of the Center for a New American Security. “That appears to be the current direction for US industrial policy in these critical sectors.” Intel’s Ohio chip hub — once touted as part of a comeback — has faced repeated delays and will require tens of billions more to launch next-generation manufacturing. “Just a few billion dollars to fund the Ohio plant doesn’t cut it for Intel,” said Jay Goldberg of Seaport Research Partners.

    "fullContent": "Costco Says It Will Not Sell Abortion Pill Mifepristone Authored by Aldgra Fredly via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Costco Wholesale said on Aug.14 that it would maintain its stance of not selling the abortion pill mifepristone at its U.S. pharmacies due to low customer demand. A patient prepares to take Mifepristone, the first medication in a medical abortion, at a clinic in Carbondale, Ill., on April 20, 2023. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters Mifepristone is a drug that blocks progesterone, the hormone needed for sustaining pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug in 2000 for terminating pregnancy through 10 weeks of gestation, stating on its website that mifepristone is safe when used properly. “Our position at this time not to sell mifepristone, which has not changed, is based on the lack of demand from our members and other patients, who we understand generally have the drug dispensed by their medical providers,” the retailer said in a statement to multiple news outlets. The move comes amid campaigns against the pill from faith-based groups, including exchange-traded fund provider Inspire Investing and legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). ADF legal counsel Michael Ross applauded Costco for its decision. “Retailers like Costco keep their doors open by selling a lifetime of purchases to families, both large and small. They have nothing to gain and much to lose by becoming abortion dispensaries,” Ross said in a statement. Students for Life America (SFLA) praised the move as “a stunning win for life,” saying that it hopes more companies would follow Costco’s policy. “Costco Wholesale insists its reason was not based on pressure from groups like ours,” SFLA stated. “We at PLG [pro-life generation] never expected an acknowledgement or public change of corporate heart on record. But we would still like to commend the pro-life movement for speaking sense into Costco Wholesale, resulting in saving the lives of the preborn and women.” In May, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the FDA to review mifepristone after an analysis found that nearly 11 percent of women who took the drug experienced serious adverse events, including sepsis and hemorrhaging. That percentage is higher than the summary figure of less than 0.5 percent in clinical trials reported on the drug label, according to the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which published the analysis. “I think the new data … is alarming, and clearly it indicates that at the very least, the label should be changed,” Kennedy said on May 14. In July 2024, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander sent letters to Costco and other retailers to dispense the abortion drug in states where it is legal. In his letter to Costco, Lander warned that failing to do so could raise “significant investor concerns,” noting that the New York City Retirement Systems held $443.9 million in Costco stock. Several investment advisers and corporate engagement consultants representing investors who held $56 million in Costco stock sent a letter to the retailer urging it not to sell mifepristone. Their petition received support from thousands of investors and customers. Reuters and Zachary Stieber contributed to this report. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 13:05",
