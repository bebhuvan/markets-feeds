    "fullContent": "Plunder Of Ghana's Gold By Chinese Criminals Continues, Authorities Say Authored by Darren Taylor via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), JOHANNESBURG—Thousands of Chinese citizens remain in Ghana to mine gold illegally, despite a crackdown by authorities in Africa’s largest producer of the precious metal, according to law enforcement agencies in the capital, Accra. Illegal gold panners from Niger work in Kibi area, southern Ghana, on April 10, 2017. Cristina Aldehuala/AFP via Getty Images They say the illegal miners appear to be taking advantage of the record-high gold price, which hit $3,500 in April, with much of the illicit metal being smuggled back to China. Organized crime groups, sometimes headed by what appear to be Chinese businesspeople, are flooding Ghana with sophisticated machinery to mine gold at scales never seen before in some areas, resulting in widespread environmental damage and fueling unemployment, according to one expert who recently spoke to The Epoch Times. According to several analysts, Chinese involvement in illegal mining in Ghana and across Africa reveals Beijing’s real motive for its increasingly strong presence on the continent: to exploit Africa’s natural resources. With Ghana’s police now often arresting Chinese citizens accused of stealing gold, relations between President John Mahama’s administration and Beijing are strained. Ghanaian officials have said the Chinese regime isn’t doing enough to prevent its nationals from committing crimes in one of West Africa’s strongest economies. But China’s ambassador in Ghana is accusing locals of “galamsey,” as it’s known in the region, or small-scale illegal gold mining, and of drawing Chinese workers to Africa. “The Chinese who are getting arrested are migrant workers who have come here to make a living,” Chinese Ambassador Tong Defa told The Epoch Times. Grace Ansah-Akrofi, director of the Ghana Police Service’s Public Affairs, has a different view. “While there are cases like those mentioned by the ambassador, it’s a bit far-fetched to say that it’s Ghanaian masterminds who are importing Chinese to commit crimes,” she told The Epoch Times. “We have our own people who are desperate enough to commit crimes. “Our criminals are not going to call on [the] Chinese to do their work. It doesn’t make sense.” A group of galamseyers, illegal gold panners, work on a gold field in Kibi, Ghana, on April 10, 2017. Cristina Aldehuela/AFP via Getty Images Enoch Aikins, a researcher at South Africa’s Institute for Security Studies, traces the roots of Ghana’s galamsey crisis to a period between 2008 and 2013, when he said more than 50,000 Chinese entered the country to mine gold illegally. “Ever since then, there has been a strong Chinese element in these kinds of crimes in Ghana; they originally came here because they knew the laws were lax, and they also bribed their way out of trouble,” Aikins told The Epoch Times. “But now that things are tightening up and they find they are being pushed out of an industry that makes them rich, they are angry.” In 2023, the government-mandated Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining released a report that implicated several government officials in illegal mining. The Mahama administration says its Office of the Special Prosecutor is investigating information in the report. Ghana is Africa’s biggest gold producer, and the sixth-largest in the world, reporting an output of 151 metric tons in 2024, according to information from the Ghana Gold Board obtained by The Epoch Times. About a third of its production comes from artisanal mining, some of it illegal, said Aikins. Demand for gold, seen as a stable investment in times of economic uncertainty, has recently reached unprecedented highs, and costs almost $3,300 per ounce as of Aug. 1. On the back of this, Chinese companies are investing billions of dollars in Ghana’s gold sector, said government spokesperson Felix Ofosu. “We are grateful for the Chinese contribution to our economy, but surely this doesn’t mean we ignore abuses committed by Chinese citizens,” he told The Epoch Times. In June, the Geneva-based Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) released a report detailing how foreign nationals, particularly from China and Burkina Faso, have introduced new technologies and machinery to Ghana that are increasing gold output while contributing to environmental harm. The GI-TOC investigation said foreigners, including Chinese, are working in concert with traditional chiefs and political elites to “benefit from or enable illicit mining operations.” “Criminal groups are allegedly engaging in gold smuggling and money laundering through casinos and other businesses,” said the independent policy research institute. Ofosu said court cases and investigations have revealed that “Chinese criminals are the ones who finance locals and give them technical support” to facilitate illegal mining. He pointed to the case of En “Aisha” Huang, known in Ghana as the “Galamsey Queen.” Deported several times between 2018 and 2022, Huang kept returning “because she couldn’t resist the lure” of Ghana’s gold, said Ansah-Akrofi. In December 2023, Huang was sentenced to 4.5 years in prison and ordered to pay a $4,000 fine for running an illegal gold mining syndicate. James Boafo, an expert in the environmental effects of illegal mining at Ghana’s University of Cape Coast, told The Epoch Times that “China’s hand is far from hidden” in the “destruction” happening in his country. “Machinery brought into Ghana from China is causing a lot of damage,” he said. “Ghana’s traditional small-scale miners use very basic tools to extract gold, so they can reach only shallow depths. “But these days, illegal miners are able to go very deep in the earth, thanks to excavators and bulldozers supplied by Chinese partners. “In Ghana, now we have many polluted rivers because of this. Our water quality is seriously degraded, and drinking it is a problem.” He added that criminal operations use rivers to sift gold dust and nuggets from the sediment. “This activity causes entire river systems, across many thousands of kilometres, to be muddy,” Boafo said. “Then the operators use toxic substances like lead and mercury to take the gold from the water. Whether they are Chinese or Africans, they just don’t care.” He said illegal mining operations fronted by the Chinese are also threatening Ghana’s cocoa industry. “They destroy lands and forests and plantations,” Boafo said. Well-resourced Chinese citizens are outcompeting local artisanal miners, who are consequently falling into unemployment and poverty, he noted. Professor Gladys Ansah, who has investigated illegal mining for the University of Ghana, said Mahama’s government “should not let up” in its arrests and prosecutions of illegal miners, no matter their nationalities. “Over the years, we’ve had a lot of committees and programs focused on getting rid of this,” she told The Epoch Times. “But they weren’t so effective, partly because our government didn’t want to offend China; so the Chinese were treated with kid gloves.” As far back as 2013, Ansah said, a joint task force of military and police arrested 4,500 Chinese miners. “They weren’t prosecuted; they were deported, and we paid for it because a lot of them came back and many are still here,” she said. South African foreign policy analyst, Sanusha Naidu, told The Epoch Times that Chinese links to illegal harvesting of metals and minerals are “cementing” a growing perception in the continent that Beijing’s “real motive for being in Africa in such a big way is to exploit natural resources, by whatever means possible.” Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 22:35",

    "fullContent": "Australian Senate Gags Debate on Bill To Define A Man And Woman Authored by Monica O'Shea via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Labor and the Greens have blocked debate on legislation that would have provided a clear definition of a man and a woman in Australia. Symbols for male and female in a hardware store in Western Australia on July 13, 2025. Susan Mortimer/The Epoch Times Liberal Senator Alex Antic introduced the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Restoring Biological Definitions) Act 2025 at the end of the recent parliamentary session. The bill (pdf) specifically repeals the definition of gender identity and omits every occurrence of the word “gender identity.” In addition, the bill provides a clear definition for men and women and substitutes the word “different sex” with “the opposite sex.” “Man means a member of the male sex irrespective of age. Woman means a member of the female sex irrespective of age,” the bill states. Antic said the issue would not go away and described the situation as “absolutely unbelievable.” “The Bill was designed to protect women’s sport and women’s spaces but Labor and the Greens wouldn’t allow it to pass into the second reading,” he said in a post to X. Antic said the Bill’s aim was to restore the definitions of a man and a woman, which had been “deleted in 2013” by the Labor government. “Yes, you heard that right, as presently enacted, the Sex Discrimination Act has no working understanding of what constitutes a man or a woman,” he told supporters on Aug. 1. “My Bill also proposed to remove the concept of ‘gender identity’ from the Act altogether, which the Labor government added as a category of protected classes.” Unbelievable scenes today as Labor and the Greens blocked the passage of the debate of my Sex Discrimination Amendment (Restoring Biological Definitions) Bill in the Senate.https://t.co/bw94wd94OU — Senator Alex Antic (@SenatorAntic) July 31, 2025 Debate Halted The bill was shot down before it was able to proceed to a second reading. During parliament, Queensland Liberal Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate Paul Scarr pointed out that the Senate usually does not stop discussion at such an early stage. “While the Senate has the opportunity to reject a bill at the first reading stage, in practice, the first reading is almost always passed without opposition and is regarded as a purely formal stage. The coalition support these normal procedures as we have with many Greens, Labor or crossbench bills that we strongly opposed,” he said (pdf). At the first reading stage, the title of the bill is read out and a copy of the bill is read to members of parliament, with no debate. It is only at the second reading where debate takes place. Minister for Women Katy Gallagher raised concerns debate on the legislation would hurt children who identified as trans. “We do not agree with the Senate being a place where individual harm can be done to young people across this country. That is what would have happened had we allowed this bill to proceed in the normal course, and we won’t stand for it. Trans children deserve better from this chamber,” she said. Australian Greens Whip Nick McKim said they would not allow the Senate to discuss the legislation. “We know exactly what Senators Antic and [Matt] Canavan are up to here. They are introducing a bill that they want to use to provide a platform for transphobic people in our community to punch down on transgender Australians and, in particular, on trans kids,” he said. “Well, as far as the Australian Greens are concerned, we are never, never going to vote in this place to allow you to create that platform.” However, One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts raised concerns that Labor and the Greens were controlling debate. “What we’re seeing here is an example of control, and, always, beneath control there is fear. Of what are the Greens and their coalition partner, Labor, afraid?” The Coalition supported the bill progressing for debate, but this was blocked by the Labor and Greens majority, with 25 in favour of the bill moving forward and 36 against.

    "fullContent": "Trump's Base Fragments Further As He Demands States Support Israel Or Risk Disaster Relief Reuters reports that President Donald Trump has announced new restrictions barring federal disaster preparedness funds from going to states or cities that boycott Israeli companies, in a move which is sure to further divide Trump's base, given it's widely perceived even among many conservatives as flying in the face of America First. Critics have long argued that Republicans have been placing the foreign nation Israel's defense and funding needs ahead of American citizens' well-being. This certainly constitutes more evidence that this is the case. Monday's controversial order has resulted in an avalanche of online commentary and angry reaction. To receive aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), states must now demonstrate and confirm that there's no policy of severing business ties specifically with companies based in Israel. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's office has said that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will enforce anti-discrimination laws. The US administration has long characterized the international Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement as rooted in antisemitism. Critics have shot back that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not at all the same things. This would impact at least $1.9 billion which FEMA distributes annually related to natural disaster and other relief. According to Responsible Statecraft: To be eligible for $1.9 billion available in federal grants from FEMA for disaster preparation essentials, including emergency management salaries and rescue gear, U.S. states and cities must agree that they will not cut off “commercial relations specifically with Israeli companies.” In essence, signing a loyalty oath to another country. Reuters tallies that at least 34 US states currently have laws that prohibit boycotts of Israeli firms. For example, Governor Greg Abbott, where recent Texas anti-BDS legislation gained significant media coverage, has stated that \"anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies.\" It seems Trump wants to see all 50 states adopt such legislation. A move such as this - actually linking funds which would go to Americans caught in disasters and emergencies - to a litmus test of loyalty to a foreign power, is certainly unprecedented in American legal and FEMA history. It's getting lots of reaction on social media, in circles on the Right and the Left... Denying American victims of natural disasters aid if they are insufficiently supportive of Israel.

    "fullContent": "Against The \"Impossible\" Authored by Josiah Lippincott via American Greatness, Earlier this year, I was talking with a prominent libertarian economist on matters of fiscal and monetary policy. I noted that, in my view, the core problem in this unholy nexus was the Federal Reserve’s ongoing dominance over the nation’s money supply and financial industry. It was critical, I said, that we dissolve the central bank. The inevitable consequence of credit expansion (money printing) is inflation and malinvestment. The very existence of the Federal Reserve robs savers of their purchasing power and occludes true market data, leading to investors pouring their limited resources into schemes that should not exist in a free market. In doing so, these investors did not place their funds into products that buyers actually want. This inevitably leads to cycles of boom and bust that are ruinous for the common good. I expected him to agree. After all, this was a libertarian economist; I assumed that ranting against the Fed, fiat money, and government interference would be his thing. Instead, he simply shrugged. Getting rid of the Fed is impossible, he told me. We therefore had no choice but to make our peace with this system and try to make it work as well as we could. “Impossible.” That word stood out to me. Precision in language matters. When we use a word, we should know what it means. We should not say things cavalierly. Without clear language, there can be no clear thought. If something is in fact impossible, then, of course, we should not spend time debating about it. It is impossible, for instance, to have the sum of the three angles of a triangle add up to any number other than 180 degrees. It is likewise impossible to drop a heavy weight from a height and expect it to float or for a human being to give birth to an oak tree. These things are truly impossible. By the rules of logic in the world we inhabit, certain things cannot be otherwise. They simply are. These brute facts are not a subject of deliberation. Nothing is to be done about them. We should be deeply wary, however, in assigning this status of immovable fact to things that, as it turns out, can be other than what they are. Just because a thing is difficult to accomplish or unlikely does not make it impossible. Political regimes can change. There are, for instance, many different kinds of governments on the earth, and they differ in crucial ways. Laws are made and unmade. People move. Governments come into being and are overthrown. There was, for instance, a time in this nation’s history when the Federal Reserve did not exist. There may come a time when it will once again cease to be. Congress brought the Federal Reserve into being by law. It could be undone by the same process. Human institutions do not possess the certitude and unchanging quality of the basic axioms at the heart of logical thinking. 2 + 2 has always and everywhere equaled 4, but the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991. That government has not always existed everywhere and always. Man has a nature. He always and everywhere has the same features. All men seek good things and avoid bad things. Men may disagree wildly about what those things are, but all of us are engaged in this fundamental pursuit. If a suicidal man thought he would be better off alive than dead, he would not kill himself. Moreover, we see that human beings always give birth to human beings. We all need to sleep, eat, and defecate. Man is always and everywhere a being unto death. These are unchanging realities for us. It is incorrect, however, to attribute an unchanging nature to things that are in fact changeable. I notice that on the American right, there is often a profound sense of pessimism and melancholy that stems from this error. Many an influencer, activist, or commentator I have known will proclaim a given policy or campaign to be “impossible.” They will write it off as unfeasible with a wave of the hand. It cannot be done. Why even try? This despairing view of reality has poisoned many great projects and prevented countless others from even getting off the ground. There are indeed many policy changes that are not wise to pursue or that require resources that would be better spent elsewhere. Trade-offs and opportunity costs are simply part of life. They are unchanging features of human action. But to say that a thing comes at a price or is difficult is not the same as saying it is impossible. Nor are crude references to statistics a substitute for thought. The odds of any given American becoming a billionaire are only 1 in 380,000, but those odds are not definitive statements about an individual’s ability to create a groundbreaking innovation (or utilize government regulations to monopolize a lucrative market). At the end of the day, pointing to aggregates is not enough to understand the individuals that are part of the whole. Averages can be useful politically and can even help guide personal decisions. But an average isn’t everything. It isn’t the last word. Precision in thought—knowledge of what we know and acknowledgment of what we don’t—is crucial for political life. Despair is a sin, and pessimism is not necessarily wisdom. You often can, it turns out, just do things. And you should! As the American right moves forward in the coming years, we need to remind ourselves of this core truth. Real change, both for good and ill, is always possible. It is an error to presume to have knowledge that we really don’t have. Both mindless optimism and free-falling pessimism are wrong. The latter is, among conservatives, more common than the former. It poses a greater spiritual danger. The temptation to sit on one’s hands, wishing and whining but never doing anything useful, is very powerful on the right. A whole legion of anklebiters, cranks, and dour-faced losers surrounds us. These people are a spiritual dead end. There is nothing to be gained, in the end, from complaining or fantasizing about an apocalypse in which action will then and only then become possible. We live in this world, right here, right now. We should focus on that! I don’t know, for instance, if we will succeed in my lifetime in eliminating the Federal Reserve. I am not certain that it should be the highest priority for conservatives in this moment. But I am certain that we cannot live in peace and freedom while the central bank burrows its way into every aspect of the American economy. The right thing to do is to oppose tyranny wherever it is found. We should be honest, if only to ourselves, about what needs to be done. We should never pretend that slavery is preferable to liberty or defeat to victory. We should fight. We should make a day of it.
