The World Robot Conference 2025 opened in Beijing on Friday, as a robotic host invited attendees to jointly inaugurate the event. The expo of the World Robot Conference features over 1,500 exhibits from more than 200 leading domestic and international robotics companies,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/4ABzwuZ9YX ‚Äî Global Times (@globaltimesnews) August 8, 2025 What she found is that consumer interest in humanoid robots is beginning to rise. Her view is that the tech inflection point for these bots entering the real world is still 2 to 3 years away - certainly less than ten. At least 20 new humanoid robots were launched at the event. Here are Du's top takeaways from WRC: 1. Very strong family/consumer visitor traffic that we observed at the event as compared to 2025 WAIC in Shanghai. While the latter was more focused on broad AI academic and industry development topics with humanoid robot as a subset, and thus had more professional visitors, WRC is completely dedicated to robot technologies and product demos. This in our view suggests that near-term educational, companion and entertainment demand potential could be strong (aside from scientific study, AI model training, government, developers and stage performance demand etc). In the long term, we see this as an early indicator that as long as robot products are useful, affordable and safe enough, consumer demand potential could be very significant aside from manufacturing demand. Recently Unitree launched its new product R1 that is priced at Rmb39,900 (121cm/25kg/26 DOF) and Engine.ai announced plans to launch SA02 (125cm/25kg/26+2 DOF) soon at Rmb38,500, both of which could be targeting these demands with product specs that are also much more simplified. 2. Regarding the technology inflection point, the most positive comments we heard suggest that at least 1-2 years are still required to scale up data and enhance models for reinforcement learning (RL), or to transition to end-to-end operations after 1-2 years of rule-based operation. This is primarily because industrial settings are difficult to simulate, potentially requiring up to 70-80% of high-quality real-world data for effective training, per some comments. We also heard about practices such as multi-modal remote operation by humans as a bridge solution, provided low latency can be ensured (with two companies citing Tesla's new diner in Los Angeles where Optimus robots were observed serving popcorn). During his speech at the opening ceremony, Unitree CEO Wang Xingxing defined the robot's \"ChatGPT moment\" as actually being able to complete tasks with generalized skillsets in a completely new environment, which he said is at least 2-3 years away, but not more than 10 years away. That said, Google's new AI video generation model, Veo3, introduced in May 2025, which notably creates and incorporates audio (including dialogue, sound effects, and background music) and excels from text and image prompting to real-world physics and accurate lip-syncing, presents an interesting discussion point among robot companies. Its capabilities have raised the question of whether its underlying AI architecture could be even more optimal than Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL), which some have regarded as a primary AI solution for robotics and embodied AI since early this year. Therefore, we highlight that investors should be aware of potential product redesign risk given the ongoing, rapid co-evolution between software and hardware structures, as these two elements remain intrinsically linked in AI development. However, we are encouraged to see the industry's swift progress, with new advancements emerging every couple of months. A side note is that Nvidia has been very proactive at WRC, delivering keynote speech/seminars and showcasing its strategic initiatives in Physical AI and General-purpose Robotics, with its full-stack suite that encompasses cloud-scale model training, physics-based simulation (e.g., Isaac Sim/Lab) for synthetic data generation, and real-time edge AI deployment (e.g., Jetson AGX Thor). They have also recently newly introduced Cosmos Reason, an advanced Vision Language Model (VLM) designed to imbue robots with common sense and the ability to understand real-world scenarios. It is worth noting that almost every robot product is still using Jetson AGX Thor or the broader Jetson platform, per our checks. 3. There have been 20+ new products launched around this event (in July/Aug) out of total ~50 humanoid robot exhibitors (alongside another ~120 industrial robots and component companies). We saw variations across wheel-based and bipedal robots (with full rotary actuators or combination of rotary+linear). Overall product performance (WBC or whole body control) has improved quite significantly vs our visits in Feb/May in terms of speed and smoothness. All live demos functioned well from those companies that we saw and we came away positively surprised on this front. 4. In terms of applications, there were four major directions that we perceived: a) for education, show-room guide and stage performance purposes; b) standard platform for developers and scientific study/AI training purposes; c) manufacturing & logistics; and d) consumer/elderly care/companion. a) and b) are currently contributing the bulk of the volumes while for c), we were informed by companies we met that success rates for selective tasks such as pick and place, sorting, assembly and inspection has now reached 80-99.5% with further improvement mainly to address long tail and abnormal situations; while regarding whether robot operation speed (reasoning & execution) can match that of customers' product line, it seems that non-production line tasks are where those robot players are currently targeting in a pragmatic way to ramp up initial volumes, and also to adapt to future flexible manufacturing system (FMS) needs. We also learned that manufacturers value whole system efficiency (e.g. multi-robot collaboration) more than single robot efficiency against single human labor on the same task. An 18-month payback is considered reasonable by customers to place orders, per one company's comment. 5. On cost reduction, we perceived that among those robot players, domestic component ratio appears quite high (possibly ~80% already). They have also worked on the design optimization aspect this year to further lower cost with some hardware specs being lowered, we noticed. Going forward, volume leverage remains the key to bring the cost curve down. 6. In terms of recent government subsidies news, media reports suggest consumer purchase subsidies at Rmb1,500 per unit (on a single purchase exceeding Rmb10,000) and corporate purchase subsidies at Rmb250k per unit (on a single purchase exceeding Rmb5mn). These discounts are for in-store purchases at the \"E-Town Robot Consumption Festival\" in Beijing, which will run from Aug 2 to Aug 17. Online discounts are also available on JD.com: consumers and enterprises alike can get Rmb 600 off orders greater than Rmb 6,000, and Rmb 50 off orders greater than Rmb 500. (news link, link).

    "fullContent": "Is Your Data Held Hostage? There's A Ransomware Negotiator For That Authored by Chris Summers via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Mark Lance‚Äôs phone rings when a company‚Äôs data is being held hostage. Often, the perpetrators are demanding a ransom to return sensitive information. Mark Lance, a ransomware negotiator with Guidepoint Security, said early intervention is key in cyberattacks, as it helps manage expectations and outline options for victims. Courtesy of Guidepoint Security ‚ÄúThe largest demand for one of our victims was $70 million,‚Äù said Lance, a ransomware negotiator with Virginia-based Guidepoint Security. Failure to pay is under the threat that the company‚Äôs information will be made public. ‚ÄúThe earlier we get engaged, the better,‚Äù Lance told The Epoch Times. ‚ÄúIn most circumstances ‚Ä¶ a client has already recognized that they‚Äôve been a victim‚Äîthey‚Äôve been informed via ransom notes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe help people recognize that even if there‚Äôs no intent on paying a ransom, there‚Äôs a tremendous amount of value in engaging the cyber criminals, because ‚Ä¶ you can still do things like delay the inevitable release of their information, which will allow for more time for the forensics and incident response work stream to make sure that they are patched.‚Äù Cyber attacks, usually involving ransomware, are being perpetrated against corporations and state-owned agencies in the United States every day. In the first half of 2025, a Comparitech report shows 208 ransomware attacks on government agencies globally, a 65 percent increase from the same period of 2024. Ransomware is a type of malicious software‚Äîor malware‚Äîthat prevents a user from accessing his or her computer files, systems, or networks and demands that he or she pay a ransom for their return, according to the FBI. The average cost to the victim of a ransomware attack has risen from $761,106 in 2019 to an estimated $5.13 million in 2025, according toPurpleSec, a U.S.-based cybersecurity company. That includes the ransom payment itself, the recovery costs, and various indirect costs such as reputational damage. Lance, who has worked in cybersecurity for 25 years, said when he is called in at the early stage of an attack, the victim is usually still performing a business impact analysis. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not necessarily sure what has fully transpired or has occurred within their environment, to know what they potentially need to do as next steps,‚Äù he said. By ‚Äúenvironment,‚Äù Lance means all the hardware, software, and networks that support an organization‚Äôs operating systems. He said a ransomware negotiator can manage expectations and give the victim an idea of their options. He said he can buy valuable time, and also allow the victim to work with legal counsel to determine what sort of disclosure they are going to have to make to the public, to stockholders, to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other regulators. Lance said the threat actors also have to provide some sort of evidence that they have accessed the victim‚Äôs data, and will have to provide a file tree, which is a map of directories leading to the files they have accessed. ‚ÄúWe can gather and glean information from those communications that can be shared, that they might not have otherwise. But yeah, the earlier [we are brought in], the better,‚Äù he said. Jeanette Manfra, chief cybersecurity official for the Department of Homeland Security, speaks during a briefing at the White House on Dec. 19, 2017. Manfra announced that the United States believes North Korea was behind the global WannaCry cyberattacks. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Lance said at an early stage he tries to figure out what the client wants from the communication with the ransomware gang, ‚Äúand then we develop a strategy around that.‚Äù He said the initial strategy might be simply to delay while they find out more about the attack and how serious it is in terms of consequences. He said the victim might later decide they are willing to make a ransom payment, and he said, ‚ÄúThen our strategy changes into how we‚Äôre negotiating terms, like, do they need it quickly? Or do we have time? So our strategy will change based on the needs of the client and what they‚Äôre trying to get out of it.‚Äù Cyber Ransom Notes Most often, the ransom note is left as a message on an individual system, Lance said. The note will usually advise the victim not to try to touch any of the IT systems and to download a Tor browser, go to a website on the darknet, and initiate communications with the ransomware attackers.

    "fullContent": "Man's Private Plane Repeatedly Stolen For Joyrides, Then Repaired, By Unknown Stranger Here's one you don't see every day. A baffling aviation mystery has left 75-year-old Jason Hong both confused and frustrated: an unknown stranger has repeatedly stolen his plane, flown it without incident, landed it flawlessly ‚Äî and even repaired it, according to Local 12. Hong told the Los Angeles Times the saga began when he first noticed the plane was gone. \"I got confused,\" he recalled. \"I thought, 'did I park it somewhere else, did the airport manager move it?' But I looked all over.\" Two days later, the aircraft turned up about 25 miles away, unscathed except for some cigarette butts in the cabin. The Local 12 report says that, determined to prevent a repeat theft, Hong removed the battery and planned to check back the following weekend. But when he returned, the plane was missing again ‚Äî this time found 18 miles from the thief‚Äôs first landing spot. Even stranger, the battery had been replaced with a new one. Using a flight-tracking app, Hong discovered that both joyrides occurred on his 75th birthday. With no security cameras at the airports, authorities have been unable to identify the culprit. Hong suspects the thief has significant flying experience, noting that \"landing is not easy\" and replacing a plane‚Äôs battery requires specialized tools and knowledge. He estimates the intruder spent hundreds of dollars on the new battery, tools, and even a headset found in the cockpit. \"Someone breaks into your house, they're looking for jewelry or cash right?\" Hong said. \"But in this case, what's the purpose? It's like someone breaks my window, and then they put a new one up.\" One pilot at the second airport claimed to have seen a woman in her 40s or 50s sitting in the cockpit rather than in the lounge. Hong has now chained the aircraft in place until a full inspection can be completed. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 17:20",

Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times ‚ÄúFor too long, politicians turned a blind eye to the suffering of American citizens while protecting criminal illegal aliens. That ended on January 20,‚Äù the department‚Äôs Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an Aug. 6 statement. ‚ÄúUnder President [Donald] Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem, DHS is standing with the victims‚Äînot depraved criminal illegal aliens,‚Äù she added. DHS honored ‚Äúthe strength and resilience‚Äù of the victims and their families affected by crimes committed by illegal immigrants. ‚ÄúBehind every one of these crimes is a victim and their family left to rebuild their lives after unimaginable loss, suffering, and brutality,‚Äù McLaughlin said. Among the victims remembered in the statement are girls, adolescents, women, and men, including officials and ICE officers. Luis Jocsan Nanez L√≥pez, 15, was shot and killed on July 20 while trying to protect his mother from an attempted rape, allegedly by Mexican national Gildardo Amandor-Mart√≠nez in Kentucky. Amandor-Mart√≠nez also allegedly assaulted Luis‚Äôs sister with a firearm. Martinez made two failed attempts to enter the United States, but on the third attempt, he was able to enter at an unknown date and location. Megan Bos, 37, was found decapitated in a bleach-filled container in Illinois in April, after being reported missing on March 9. The alleged perpetrator was identified as Luis Mendoza-Gonz√°lez, from Mexico. Santiago L√≥pez Morales, 48, was murdered at a Motel 6 in Garland, Texas, in June 2025. DHS confirmed that the suspects in the crime are three Venezuelan men identified as Yosguar Aponte-Jim√©nez, Jos√© Trivino-Cruz, and Jes√∫s Bellor√≠n-Guzm√°n. Hallie Helgeson, 18, and Brady Heiling, 19, died in a car crash in Wisconsin in 2025, caused by a suspected drunk driver, Noelia Saray Mart√≠nez-Avila, from Honduras. Maria Pleitez, 42, and her 11-year-old daughter, Dayanara, died in a car crash in New Jersey in 2025. Mexican national Ra√∫l Luna-P√©rez is suspected of driving under the influence and causing the deaths. An unnamed woman was sexually assaulted on July 2, allegedly by Jos√© Maldonado-Zavala, a native of Honduras, at an apartment complex in Houston, Texas. According to records, Maldonado-Zavala falsely claimed the victim‚Äôs air conditioning was leaking into his apartment. He then forcibly grabbed her arm, dragged her into his residence against her will, and sexually assaulted her; she fought off the attacker and managed to flee. A 17-year-old girl was harassed and raped, allegedly by a transgender illegal immigrant from Colombia who presents as a woman, Nicol Alexandra Contreras-Suarez. Contreras-Suarez was charged with rape of a minor and harassment in Columbia, New York, in 2025. A man suffered life-threatening stab wounds after being attacked during a public soccer game, allegedly by Jefferson Javier L√≥pez-Tinoco of Honduras, in Maryland in 2025. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer was shot in the arm and cheek during an attempted armed robbery in New York in 2025, allegedly by Cristian Aybar Berroa and Miguel Francisco Mora N√∫√±ez from the Dominican Republic. A U.S. government official was harassed in Virginia in 2025, allegedly by Jos√© Madrid Reyes of El Salvador. In 2018, a woman was sexually assaulted in Oregon while walking on Independence Day by Kevin Contreras-Mendoza of Mexico. DHS said it reinforced its commitment to restoring security in the country and sent a message of support to all victims and families affected by crimes committed by illegal immigrants.

Tarriela released the footage on X. He described what unfolded: Here is a longer video capturing the collision between the PLA Navy 164 and the China Coast Guard 3104.

    "fullContent": "RussiaGate: 'A Murder Of American Democracy Was Committed' Authored by James Howard Kunstler, Under Color Of Law \"The second-order and third-order damages of RussiaGate are incalculable. A murder of American democracy was committed.\" - Mike Benz on \"X\" Surely you‚Äôve noticed the ominous cone of silence around the DOJ and the FBI as rumors of ‚Äúaccountability‚Äù mount against well-known figures who used government to make war against its own citizens. That is exactly what happened, by the way, in case you‚Äôre baffled by the news. The agencies aren‚Äôt leaking this time, especially not to the mendacious scribes that infest The New York Times and The WashPo, who function as vanguard to the corps of traitors in the rogue fourth branch of government called the Blob. So, the silence begs you to ask: Are they doing anything in there? Yes, they are making cases. And they are not yapping idly about it in the news, legacy or alt. They are preparing evidence for grand juries that will decide if probable cause exists to indict those well-known figures ‚Äî several of whom have become cable news performers, foolishly, if obliquely, advertising their own culpability for years now. You‚Äôll just have to wait, though perhaps not for long. It is August, after all, the horse latitudes of the year when things go still. You are lectured incessantly and sanctimoniously by these same suspects about the rule of law (in ‚Äúour democracy‚Äù). Many of these characters are maestros in the dark arts of lawfare, which, paradoxically, is the practice of using law to pervert and dishonor the rule of law. Lately, you are introduced to a similar sounding phrase, under color of law, with a related meaning. Understand it and you will see what has been behind virtually all the mischief in our public affairs this past, vicious decade. Under color of law has deep roots in Anglo-American jurisprudence because law, by its nature, lends itself to abuse and nefarious misuse. The law‚Äôs ‚Äúnature‚Äù is that it is a set of rules to decide matters of consequence, both personal and public, where much is at stake: ownership of property, liberty, life itself. At times, actions are taken in the name of the law to unjustly deprive persons of life, liberty, and property, usually for the benefit of other persons. The phrase, life, liberty, and property, derives from John Locke‚Äôs Two Treatises on Government (1689), which argued that these are natural rights, God-given, and that it is government‚Äôs duty to protect these rights, government being the practical application of law. The phrase life, liberty, and property deeply influenced America‚Äôs founders. Thomas Jefferson changed it up a bit in the Declaration of Independence as ‚Äúlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,‚Äù with a eudaimonian twist to inspire America to flourish on its own, off England‚Äôs leash. It was also Jefferson‚Äôs way of detaching the Declaration from the issue of slavery, where ‚Äúproperty‚Äù could refer to human beings. But the Lockean original, life, liberty and property, reappears in the Bill of Rights to the Constitution. It is in the Fifth Amendment, protecting persons from the arbitrary deprivation of these rights without due process by the federal government, and in the Fourteenth Amendment applying the same principle of law to state governments. Where lawfare comes in is under due process. Lawfare‚Äôs aim is to pervert due process, to use officers of the courts to act unfairly and unjustly in the name of the law, and thus, under color of law. This is exactly what you saw in the several cases brought against Mr. Trump in New York State in 2024, a three-ring circus of process-abuse engineered by the ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù White House, coordinated with Merrick Garland‚Äôs DOJ (through Deputy AG Lisa Monaco), with assists from NY AG Letitia James and Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. Ditto the RICO case attempted in Atlanta under Fulton County DA Fani Willis, a spectacular botch. And ditto, the cases brought under Special Counsel Jack Smith in Florida and DC, also badly botched. The slovenly ineptitude of these cases was really something to behold, including the sordid romantic complications around Fani Willis and her chosen chief prosecutor, ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù Nathan Wade, a divorce lawyer with no experience in criminal law. Throw in the disgraceful, self-conflicted antics of the Judges Kaplan, Engoron, and Merchan in the New York cases, and the oafish conduct of Jack Smith and his assistants in Florida and DC ‚Äî and what you get is a demonstration of how crude an instrument sheer lying actually is in the practice of law, and how easily it breaks against the people using it. Some of these characters are just now coming to grief: Letitia James faces a DOJ action on depriving Mr. Trump‚Äôs rights, and SC Jack Smith is under active FBI investigation for evidence tampering and other crimes of process abuse. It would be fitting for all the prosecutors and the three judges in the New York cases to face similar inquiries. The phrase under color of law establishes liability for abuse of power for officials vested with the terrible authority for upending people‚Äôs lives. The phrase ‚Äúdeprivation of rights‚Äù appears explicitly in federal statutes primarily focused on holding government officials and others acting with apparent legal authority accountable for willfully violating an individual‚Äôs constitutional or legal rights. The most relevant statute is 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 242, which directly criminalizes such conduct. Additional statutes, such as 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 241, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 250, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2243, and 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2244. That‚Äôs where all this is going, even if all that‚Äôs coming out of the DOJ and FBI for the moment is that ominous silence. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 16:20",

    "fullContent": "Goldman Finds \"Sharp Declines\" In Import Prices As Foreigners Absorb Trump's Tariffs Back in late June, we were first to point out something startling: contrary to conventional wisdom according to which prices of heavily-tariffed goods would surge and spark runaway inflation (just skim this from certified idiot Paul Krugman), we found just the opposite, namely that Japanese passenger car export prices had plunged by the most on record, demonstrating that it was foreign producers that were eating the bulk of the tariffs, certainly in this particular case. well would you look at that: guess who is eating all those tariff costs (hint, it's not US consumers) pic.twitter.com/iwdKyeqTII ‚Äî zerohedge (@zerohedge) June 22, 2025 Three days later, our chart ended up in front of Fed Chair Jerome Powell during his periodic grilling in Congress, where he was unable to give a clear explanation as to why the export prices of Japanese autos would be plunging in response to sharply higher tariffs (the answer, of course, is simple: foreign producers simply can not pass through costs to the US market without losing much if not all of their market share, so they have no choice but to eat the loss). well would you look at that: three days later Powell has to discuss this chart https://t.co/6AfkRRSjJp pic.twitter.com/SOGjff2Fsl ‚Äî zerohedge (@zerohedge) June 25, 2025 Fast forward to today when Goldman, similar to Morgan Stanley over the weekend, tried to analyze why those tariffs which it - and so many other economists predicted incorrectly - would already have sent inflation soaring, have failed to do so. While there is a bunch of stuff in the report (which pro subs can read at their leisure here), what was most notable is the \"discovery\" that it's not just Japanese car makers. As Goldman's Jan Hatzius reveals, \"we find that US import prices on tariffed goods have declined somewhat, suggesting that foreign exporters have absorbed some tariff costs by lowering their export prices to the US, unlike during the 2018-2019 trade war.\" Our updated analysis shows that a 1pp increase in the product-level tariff rate led to a 0.25% cumulative decline in import prices over the first three months of implementation, with minimal impact thereafter. Of course, here Goldman had to mix fact with projection to not sound like a bunch of wrong, confused career economists. When one strips away hypothesis and forecast, here is what actually happened: \"following the implementation of China and auto tariffs, import prices (exclusive of tariffs) of both consumer and non-consumer goods from China, as well as import prices of passenger cars (exclusive of tariffs) from the EU and Japan, all experienced sharp declines.\" Looking forward, Goldman concludes that whereas \"foreign exporters had absorbed 14% of the cost of all tariffs implemented so far through June, their share will rise to 25% if the more recent tariffs follow the same pattern as the earliest tariffs on China.\" This also means that the 9% increase in the effective tariff rate through June has reduced import prices by at least 1.3% so far, and that the total 14% increase in the effective tariff rate that Goldman expects in 2025 will likely reduce import prices by 3.7%, if not much more assuming foreign producers continue to keep prices reduced to remain competitive with lower-cost domestic producers. The rest of the Goldman note goes on to do what Morgan Stanley tried to do yesterday: forecast just when all those tariffs will eventually finally show up in inflation... an exercise they have to do because both giant banks were very wrong in incorrectly assuming that inflation would already be far higher than it is so far. Don't be surprise if tomorrow's CPI comes in tame yet again, prompting even more revisions to Goldman's inflation ETA. Much more in the full Goldman note, available to pro subscribers.
