    "fullContent": "A common question we hear from investors is whether they’re missing out by focusing on developed markets like the US or Europe, especially when growth in countries such as China or India appears far more dynamic. Another concern: Is the US market overvalued? Should we be looking elsewhere? In this insightful webinar, we explore these questions using real-world examples and market data and answer: • Why selected developed market companies have consistently captured the most profitable parts of emerging market growth—often outpacing local firms in value creation. • How the “real” valuation of the US market compares to other global markets. How should investors interpret valuations metrics in broader context, and what role should other geographies play? • A brief review of our portfolio’s positioning, and how we are navigating today’s macroeconomic and valuation environment.
