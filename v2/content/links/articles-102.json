Charlie Savage <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/us/politics/trump-russia-durham-explainer.html\">wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, and other Trump allies have declared that a newly declassified report on the Russia investigation provides “evidence that the Clinton campaign plotted to frame President Trump and fabricate the Russia collusion hoax.” The reality is almost precisely the opposite… The report shows that a purported email that Trump supporters have long tried to portray as a smoking gun is instead most likely a fake. Russian spies appear to have tried to make it seem authentic by assembling passages lifted from <strong>actual emails</strong> by different hacking victims…</em></p> <p><em>Mr. Trump and his aides have coupled those releases with wild and inaccurate claims about what they show, spinning the reports as proof of his long-running narrative that the investigation was a hoax instigated by enemies for political reasons.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This whole “assembled by Russian spies” line is based on one assessment about a pair of emails likely pulled by Russians from other <em>real </em>American victims of hacking. Beyond this instance of a “composite,” the paper ignores the gigantic load of material from the same source, which has been described in multiple other reports as real and affecting numerous American “victims” from the Executive and Legislative branches, as well as think-tanks and NGOs.</p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130041.042.jpg?itok=FMy-9MeS\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130041.042.jpg?itok=FMy-9MeS\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"823566aa-2ef8-45cc-9265-adc6b13c85eb\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"332\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130041.042.jpg?itok=FMy-9MeS\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p> <p>More irritating is Savage’s diatribe against Patel and the hoax “narrative,” offered without mentioning the roughly ten million instances in which the <em>Times </em>botched its coverage of Patel and Republican investigations into Russiagate. When Patel and then-House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes released the much-denounced “Nunes memo” about FISA abuse in early 2018, Savage <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/02/us/politics/nunes-memo-gop-fbi-annotated.html\">personally “annotated” the document</a>, which would be vidicated more or less entirely by an <a href=\"http://file///Users/matthewtaibbi/Desktop/120919-examination.pdf\">Inspector General investigation nearly two years later</a>. About the accusations of FISA abuse, which included use of the Steele dossier to obtain surveillance authority, Charlie wrote:</p> <ul><li> <p>The FBI had ““grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy,’” adding, “In accusing the F.B.I. of omitting important information, this memo’s critics say the memo itself omits crucial context: other evidence that did not come from Mr. Steele, much of which remains classified.”</p> <p>This is the much-used initial argument that the Steele material wasn’t important to the FISA warrant.<strong> </strong>Savage went with this talking point multiple times, also saying in another piece, “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/us/politics/secret-memo-mueller-russia-investigation.html\">Mr. Steele’s information was only one thread in a tapestry of evidence from various sources that the memo ignored, exaggerating its relative importance</a>.<strong>” </strong>Inspector General Horowitz dashed that, concluding Steele “<a href=\"http://file///Users/matthewtaibbi/Desktop/120919-examination.pdf\">played a central and essential role</a><strong>”;</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Savage went on in the “annotation”: “It makes no note of the fact that [Carter] Page attracted the F.B.I.’s interest in 2013, when agents came to believe that Russian spies were trying to recruit him.” Why didn’t Patel include that detail? Because Page was an informant in good standing with the CIA at the time, a fact an FBI lawyer was criminally <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/29/fbi-lawyer-trump-russia-probe-email-463750\">convicted for omitting</a>. Savage, who later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/us/politics/kevin-clinesmith-probation.html\">wrote about Kevin Clinesmith’s conviction</a>, omitted the same critical detail as Clinesmith — perhaps unknowingly, but still;</p> </li> <li> <p>Savage wrote, “The language used here on Mr. Steele’s relationship with the F.B.I. suggests that it was formal. But he <strong>never entered into any formal relationship</strong> from which he could be suspended or terminated, according to people familiar...” Steele was <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/imo/media/doc/abbreviated%20timeline%20horowitz.pdf\">terminated</a> as a source by the FBI “for cause” on November 17, 2016, years before the annotation article, showing Savage’s “people familiar” either weren’t “familiar” or were yanking his chain. Colleague Scott Shane would describe the firing as a decision by the FBI to “end the <strong>formal</strong> relationship” with Steele. Oops.</p> </li> </ul><p>For what it’s worth, the <em>Times </em>without Savage’s help also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russian-bots-school-shooting.html\">swallowed the Hamilton 68 hoax whole</a> and described the #ReleaseTheMemo hashtag as the work of Russian “bots”; ran an editorial called “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/nunes-memo-trump-mueller.html\">The Nunes memo is all smoke, no fire</a>”; and ran a full house editorial (one that again cited the phony Hamilton 68 dashboard, by the way) describing the Nunes report as a “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/opinion/devin-nunes-republicans-memo.html\">fake scandal</a>” designed, like the Clinton email investigation, to distract from the “real conspiracy” investigated by Robert Mueller. This sounds remarkably like today’s story, which described the Durham release as an effort to “change the subject from its broken promise to release Jeffrey Epstein files.” They write the same stories, over and over. It never ends.</p> <p>The part that really infuriated today, however, was this section:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>In reality, the F.B.I. opened its investigation based on a lead it received from the Australian government in late July 2016, after WikiLeaks released Democratic emails stolen by Russian hackers and disrupted the Democratic convention. The tip involved a Trump campaign adviser suggesting, before the hacking had become public, that the campaign had received outreach from Russia and knew what it would do.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This paragraph is an outrage. It’s carefully written to conceal how utterly the <em>Times </em>botched one of the most impactful stories of the Russiagate affair, a story called “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html\">How the Russia Inquiry Began: A Campaign Aide, Drinks and Talk of Political Dirt</a><strong>.” </strong>This professed to be the origin story of Russiagate, explaining that on July 26th, 2016, four days after Wikileaks <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/22/on-eve-of-democratic-convention-wikileaks-releases-thousands-of-documents-about-clinton-the-campaign-and-internal-deliberations/\">leaked thousands of documents</a> damaging to the Democratic Party, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html\">Australian authorities told American counterparts</a> about a suspicious Russia-themed conversation Trump aide George Papadopoulos had with a diplomat named Alexander Downer.</p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130105.805.jpg?itok=6rXuoUsb\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130105.805.jpg?itok=6rXuoUsb\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b3e6f76b-e9b5-4975-a693-0bd394f90616\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"599\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130105.805.jpg?itok=6rXuoUsb\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p> <p><em>The infamous “drinks and dirt” story</em></p> <p>The <em>Times </em>reported that Papadopoulos had been told of “dirt” Russia had, in the form of “thousands of emails that would embarrass Mrs. Clinton,” given to him by a Maltese professor named Josef Mifsud, presented as a cutout for Russia. This was described as a “driving factor” for the FBI <a href=\"https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CFH%20Timeline%20w%20Updates%2020201203%20(FINAL).pdf\">opening its “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation</a> into Trump and Russia on July 31, 2016.</p> <p>Almost everything about this story was wrong. It took a while, but Downer himself eventually admitted there was no “dirt” talk, or email talk. From the public Durham report:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>According to Downer, Papadopoulos <strong>made no mention of Clinton emails</strong>, <strong>dirt</strong> <strong>or any specific approach by the Russian government to the Trump campaign team with an offer or suggestion of providing assistance</strong>. Rather, Downer's recollection was that Papadopoulos simply stated \"the Russians have information” and that was all.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Downer also said he “did not get the sense Papadopoulos was the middle-man to coordinate with the Russians.” More infuriating? The FBI dropped Papadopoulos as a lead weeks into the Crossfire Hurricane inquiry, with Deputy Director Alexander McCabe testifying that his comments “didn’t particularly indicate” contact with Russians:</p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130123.701.jpg?itok=e8aXUJhY\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130123.701.jpg?itok=e8aXUJhY\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"781d2e09-7934-4a90-895f-0e37653b057e\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"224\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20-%202025-08-03T130123.701.jpg?itok=e8aXUJhY\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p> <p>Screwing up “dirt” and “thousands of emails” is bad, but the McCabe testimony shows the FBI knew in in August of 2016 that Papadopoulos was a dead-end. But “current and former American officials” polished that turd and fed it to the <em>Times </em>a full year and a half later. The paper then used it for its blockbuster tale about how Papadopoulos played a “critical role” in the Russiagate drama.</p> <p><strong>This will go down as an infamous screw-up and smear.</strong> Papadopoulos was totally uninvolved with any intelligence scheme and merely used as a technical pretense to start what proved to be a bogus investigation. Still, the <em>Times </em>plastered his face all over its front page as the scandal’s poster child, in what in hindsight was a proud advertisement for how badly they’d been bent over by their sources.</p> <p>Now, years later, Savage not only re-writes this passage without the name “Papadopoulos” and without references to “dirt” or “thousands of emails,” but uses sleight-of-hand to suggest what <em>was </em>said between the young Trump aide and the Australian diplomat was meaningful. He describes a “Trump campaign adviser suggesting, before the [Russian] hacking had become public, that the campaign had received outreach from Russia and knew what it would do.” <em>Knew what it would do? </em>Savage leaves out the fact that Papadopoulos had not, in fact, received outreach from Russia, and did not have or claim to have foreknowledge of hacking. He played no meaningful role. It’s part of the <em>Times </em>legend<em> </em>that he did, however, so Charlie twisted the prose like a pipe cleaner to fit the few remaining usable factoids.</p> <p>The irony is that while Papadopoulos was not the real beginning of Russiagate, the story Durham told about the U.S. acquiring a large chunk of intelligence from Russia far earlier in 2016 likely was. This was real intelligence concerning Russia that was embarrassing to Clinton, not Trump. Even at this late date, after so many Russiagate stories the paper screwed up, they continue to vomit up this nonsense.

It is important that anti-corruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption.”</p> <p>The law he referred to marked a dramatic about-face for his administration.</p> <p><strong>On July 22, Zelenskyy <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/zelenskyy-signs-new-law-reshaping-anti-corruption-bodies-prompting-protests-eu-concern-5891402\">signed</a> a measure that gave the prosecutor general sweeping authority over NABU and SAPO, including the power to reassign prosecutors and transfer cases away from the agencies.</strong></p> <p>Zelenskyy defended the move at the time, saying it would help purge Russian influence from Ukraine’s law enforcement structures and accelerate stalled investigations.</p> <p>“The anti-corruption infrastructure will work. Only without Russian influence—it needs to be cleared of that,” Zelenskyy <a href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1947803089626427753\">wrote</a> on social media at the time, saying that Ukraine must ensure “the inevitability of punishment for those who go against the law.”</p> <p>In response to the measure, thousands of Ukrainians rallied in Kyiv and other cities in the largest protests since the Russian invasion in 2022, accusing the government of undermining hard-won anti-graft safeguards.</p> <p>The European Union, which granted Ukraine candidate status in 2022, warned that the law violated one of the bloc’s core accession requirements: maintaining the independence of anti-corruption institutions.</p> <p>EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos <a href=\"https://x.com/MartaKosEU/status/1947663547233710152\">called</a> the July 22 law a “serious step back,” while the EU’s <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/zelenskyy-signs-new-law-reshaping-anti-corruption-bodies-prompting-protests-eu-concern-5891402\">delegation</a> to Ukraine said dismantling NABU’s safeguards would jeopardize trust in Kyiv’s reform efforts.</p> <p><strong>Germany’s foreign minister similarly <a href=\"https://x.com/GermanyDiplo/status/1947970535402697026\">warned</a> that curbing the agencies’ powers risked slowing Ukraine’s path to EU membership.</strong></p> <p>The backlash was compounded by a separate security operation that week in which Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/ukrainian-parliament-votes-unanimously-to-restore-independence-of-anti-corruption-agencies-5894778\">conducted</a> around 70 searches targeting NABU officials, arresting one on suspicion of spying for Russia, and another over alleged business ties to that country.</p> <p>While most allegations involved minor administrative violations, NABU warned that some of the actions had gone too far and accused authorities of trying to intimidate the watchdogs.</p> <p>Amid public protests and mounting pressure from Western allies, Zelenskyy reversed course. On July 24, he <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/zelenskyy-backtracks-on-anti-corruption-law-after-protests-eu-criticism-5892405\">submitted</a> a new bill restoring the agencies’ independence, <a href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1948349119589765420\">calling</a> the text “well-balanced” and excluding “any Russian ties,” and ensuring protection of Ukraine’s law enforcement system against Russian influence or interference.</p> <p>The Ukrainian Parliament <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/ukrainian-parliament-votes-unanimously-to-restore-independence-of-anti-corruption-agencies-5894778\">passed</a> the measure in a unanimous vote on July 31, and Zelenskyy <a href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1950902199363444819\">signed</a> it the same day, calling it the “right decision.”</p> <p>“<strong>It is very important that the state listens to public opinion</strong>,” he wrote on social media. “That it hears its citizens. Ukraine is a democracy–without a doubt.”</p> <p>The law prohibits the prosecutor general from issuing orders to NABU or SAPO, or interfering in their investigations, and reinstates key procedural safeguards lost under the earlier legislation.</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T23:15:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 19:15</span>",

Speaking to reporters after the raid, Ben Gvir said: <strong>\"The Temple Mount is for the Jews, and we will remain here forever.\"</strong></p> <p>Since becoming a minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, Ben Gvir has led at least 11 assaults on the mosque. Meanwhile, several other far-right politicians have <strong>advocated for the destruction of Al-Aqsa and the construction of a temple where they claim Jewish temples once stood</strong>.</p> <p>Among the hundreds of people to take part in Sunday's raid was right-wing Likud lawmaker Amit Halevi, who has repeatedly advocated for Israel to destroy all water, food and energy sources in Gaza.</p> <p>In June 2023, he tabled a bill that would divide Al-Aqsa Mosque between Muslims and Jews, a plan that would see shared access from the courtyard of the Dome of the Rock to the end of the northern border of Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p> <p>Palestinians fear that the incursions at Al-Aqsa, which have intensified since Israel went to war on Gaza in October 2023, are laying the groundwork for the mosque to be divided similar to how the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron was in the 1990s.</p> <p>Muslims currently have limited access to that site, and just last month, Israel transferred the authority of the mosque from the Palestinian-run Hebron municipality to a settler council.</p> <p>Aouni Bazbaz, the director of international affairs at the Islamic Waqf, the organisation that administers Al-Aqsa Mosque, described Sunday's raid as \"painful and regrettable\", telling MEE that it was a threat to the \"historical status quo and an incitement to violence\".</p> <p>\"There were terrifying numbers of people [Israeli settlers] present and some were important figures,\" he said. \"This was part of a project. The extreme religious right seeks to undermine the status quo and to clearly follow the example of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.</p> <p>\"There are no worshippers here right now, the place is empty, the Old City is empty. <strong>It's a military barracks</strong>,\" he added.</p> <p>The Jerusalem Governorate also decried the raid, and appealed to the international community, in particular Muslim states, \"to take immediate action\".</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir sparked fresh outrage today after performing Talmudic rituals inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, accompanied by an associate who carried out the “epic prostration”, a form of Jewish worship explicitly prohibited at the site <a href=\"https://t.co/pv3aKSaJvc\">pic.twitter.com/pv3aKSaJvc</a></p> — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MiddleEastEye/status/1951940076071473266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>\"What happened today is not just a traditional incursion.

As with previous actions, the protests were primarily <strong>attended by crazed, elderly white liberals</strong>. The Democrats and their NGO machine have lost not just the narrative but are drifting deeper into irrelevance. </p> <p>50501 (\"50 Protests, 50 States, 1 Movement\") is part of the <strong>permanent protest-industrial complex</strong> and was behind the underwhelming demonstrations this weekend. The group's mission is to organize large-scale, <strong>nationwide color revolution-style operations against President Trump</strong>, including these previous events:</p> <ul><li> <p><em>February 5: Anti-Trump kickoff rallies </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>February 17 (Presidents' Day): \"No Kings on Presidents Day\"</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>March 4: Third round of demonstrations</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>April 5: \"Hands Off\" protests, among the largest anti-Trump protests </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>June 14: \"No Kings\"</em></p> </li> </ul><p><strong>Each of the nationwide protests listed above has failed to generate enough momentum</strong> to shift public opinion and move the polls. The dark-money-funded NGOs behind the permanent protest-industrial complex have grown increasingly frustrated; so much so that they reportedly offered $20 million to a 'rent-a-protester' firm. </p> <p>Last month, Adam Swart, CEO of an activist group called \"Crowds on Demand\", called out one unnamed leftist entity ...</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"</em><strong><em>We had to reject an offer worth around $20 million for nationwide, large-scale demonstrations across the country.
