    "fullContent": "Literally Fake News: Acosta Eviscerated For 'Interviewing' An AI School Shooting Victim Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, Jim Acosta, the former CNN hack who President Trump notoriously said “YOU are fake news” to at the White House is now LITERALLY living up to the description after he put out an ‘interview’ with an AI generated avatar of a deceased Parkland shooting victim as a way of pushing gun control. Acosta, now broadcasting from his living room like all the other fake legacy media failures, put on a serious face and presented a ‘discussion’ with Joaquin Oliver, one of the students who died in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. Acosta prompted the ‘interview’ as a “show you don’t want to miss” and a “one of a kind interview” in the lead up to it. NEW: Former CNN host Jim Acosta gives an interview with an AI version of a deceased Parkland victim to push gun control. Acosta: “I would like to know what your solution would be for gun violence.” AI Joaquin Oliver: “Great question. I believe in a mix of stronger gun control… pic.twitter.com/ArAvRy939l — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) August 4, 2025 “What happened to you?” Acosta began the exchange, to which the AI responded in a monotone and fake sounding voice “I appreciate your curiosity. I was taken from this world too soon due to gun violence while at school.” “It’s important to talk about these issues so we can create a safer future for everyone,” the stilted voice added. “I would like to know what your solution would be for gun violence,” Acosta creepily asked the AI avatar. “Great question. I believe in a mix of stronger gun control laws, mental health support, and community engagement. We need to create safe spaces for conversations and connections, making sure everyone feels seen and heard,” Oliver’s avatar responded. “It’s about building a culture of kindness and understanding. What do you think of that?” it added, giving the exact answer you’d expect from an AI chatbot. “I think that’s a great idea, Joaquin,” Acosta creepily replied. Acosta also threw in demented questions about the NBA and Star Wars. Later he added “He’s a symbol of something that is deeply, deeply wrong with this country. People give up, and I think something like this is maybe going to give some people some hope, that we should keep charging, keep pushing for this.” Just insane. Acosta further noted “Yes, I know that it might be a little startling to see one of these young people, a child like Joaquin, come back to us in this fashion, in the form of artificial intelligence, but please understand after watching this that this AI experiment is an expression of love from the Oliver family for their son.” Acosta then interviewed the father of the victim. While it’s understandable that the loss is unbearable for the family, many found the whole thing with Acosta in extremely poor taste. I live in Parkland.. let me get you a real live person to interview Acosta, this is actually gross — Jillian Anderson (@Jillie_Alexis) August 4, 2025 I think this is morally evil. I wouldn’t and I don’t think anyone wants anyone else to put words in their mouth after death. There honestly should be a law against this to protect the memory of those who have died. This is evil evil stuff. — Matt Van Swol (@matt_vanswol) August 4, 2025 Even with his parents creating it it's still pretty sick. For any \"journalist\" to think this is a good or engaging thing to do is absolutely wild. pic.twitter.com/pebTqP7KUH — Garrett Bridges (@garrettbridges) August 5, 2025 The answers to his guests and from his guests were always scripted to begin with, this is not that far off of what he has always done he just doesn't have to pay a studio guest. — That Guy (@Beachtrash72) August 5, 2025 I know the parents probably got convinced to do this and all the other stuff by people who are telling them that they are \"saving lives\" and \"causing change.\" This isn't going to cause any of the change they seek and will simply make a mockery of their dead son. Absolutely… — Misha Turtle Island TV: X Society Xperience 🐢🐰𝕏 (@MishaTurtleX) August 5, 2025 Without authority from the family this is criminally immoral, and even with their authority, it is distasteful. — Trevekuri (@Trevekuri) August 5, 2025 What’s even more disgusting than resurrecting someone to push gun control is scripting a whole narrative and trying to act like it’s an actual interview with candid answers. — Doom Rider (@CommonArms) August 5, 2025 I really hope this is rock bottom. — Kaizen D. Asiedu (@thatsKAIZEN) August 5, 2025 Oliver’s AI likeness was previously used last year by his father to pressure members of Congress to push voting for gun control measures. “It’s been six years, and you’ve done nothing, not a thing to stop all the shootings that have continued to happen since,” the message said, adding “I died that day in Parkland, my body was destroyed by a weapon of war.” Earlier this year, Acosta declared that he was ’going independent’, which is fake news code for “nobody wants to hire me.” Acosta told the few viewers CNN has left live on air that the network basically offered him a shittier time slot and reduced pay to spew his anti-Trump venom, but that he decided to “move on.” He started his own Substack and called it ‘The Jim Acosta Show.’ Truly awful. * * * Your support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

    "fullContent": "Ugly, Tailing 3Y Auction Sees Worst Foreign Demand Since 2023 One week after the Treasury's refunding announcement unveiled no major changes to the coupon auction schedule for the next few months, instead punting everything to Bills and leading to the following headline this morning: *US TREASURY TO AUCTION $100 BILLION IN FOUR-WEEK BILLS ... moments ago we got the first actual refunding auction of the week when the Treasury sold $58BN in 3Y paper in a very mediocre auction. The high yield was 3.669%, down from 3.891% in July and the lowest since last September as the market braces for the Fed's September rate cut. As a reminder, high yields for the tenor peaked recently at 4.332% in January, and have dropped ever since. This was a 0.7bps tail to the 3.662% When Issued, the 3rd consecutive tail and 9th in the past 11 auctions. The bid to cover was 2.526, above last month's 2.509, but below the six-auction average of 2.589. The internals were uglier: Indirects dropped to 53.99 from 54.11, the lowest since Dec 2023. And with Directs once again awarded a surprisingly high 28.1%, which was down from the record 29.4% in July but otherwise was the 2nd highest on record, Dealers were left with 17.9%, up from 16.5% and the highest since April as buyside demand among foreigners, for 3Y paper remains surprisingly weak. Overall, this was a poor, tailing 3Y auction, with disappointing foreign demand and a surge in Directs to offset, and not surprisingly the bond market was less than excited after the break, although surprisingly yields have remained subdued with the 10Y trading at 4.20% before and after the auction.

    "fullContent": "\"Russia's Economy Stinks\": Drop In Energy Prices Will Make Putin \"Stop Killing People\", Trump Says \"If energy goes down enough, Putin is going to stop killing people,\" President Trump said in a fresh interview on CNBC Tuesday. \"Putin will stop killing people if we get energy down another $10 a barrel. He'll have no choice because his economy stinks.\" The stark comments come days ahead of the White House's Friday August 8 deadline for President Putin to commit to peace in Ukraine. Getty Images Trump in the media appearance put India on notice too, saying: \"They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine. If they're going to do that, then I'm not going to be happy.\" He pledged to soon raise tariffs on India \"very substantially\" over the ongoing Russian oil purchases. And yet these threats from Washington have so far failed to deter Russia, China, or India. Commenting on increased production on the part of OPEC countries and others, Trump stipulated that he expected additional declines ahead - putting the squeeze further on Russia. \"If you notice OPEC and OPEC+, they're drilling more because I think they want me happy,\" Trump said further, after OPEC+ agreed over the weekend to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September. Here is China's reaction to the secondary tariff and sanctions threats, issued yesterday: “China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,” China’s Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff. “Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,” the ministry said. President Trump: \"If energy goes down low enough, Putin's going to stop killing people. If you get energy down another $10 a barrel, he's going to have no choice, because his economy stinks.\" pic.twitter.com/gWweMdMWrS — Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) August 5, 2025 The US president's special envoy Steve Witkoff is traveling to Russia this week, in what's being described as a 'last chance' effort at jump-starting a path to peace in Ukraine and restoring bilateral US-Russia relations. Trump told reporters on Sunday he wants a quick ceasefire deal \"where people stop getting killed\" - and after repeat Russian drone and missile attacks have unleashed large amounts of casualties in the Ukrainian capital and elsewhere. Six months of Trump-led diplomatic efforts have passed, and still the warring sides are no closer to a lasting truce, which has proven elusive. But so far, there's no evidence that Trump has put real pressure on Ukraine's Zelensky to given up territory - which is probably the only concession significant enough to achieve ceasefire.
