    "fullContent": "Peter Thiel-Backed Startup Aims To Revolutionize American Uranium Production Critical minerals startup General Matter announced ambitious plans this week to construct a $1.5 billion uranium enrichment facility at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in McCracken County, Kentucky, as the Trump administration seeks to reduce reliance on rare earths from China. The groundbreaking project would be the first U.S.-owned, privately developed uranium enrichment facility and marks the largest economic development initiative in Western Kentucky's history. General Matter will develop the 100-acre uranium enrichment facility on the same site originally selected 75 years ago by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission for uranium enrichment activities. The facility will produce both low enriched uranium (LEU) and high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU), materials essential for powering advanced nuclear reactors, while the company has already secured DOE contracts for both LEU and HALEU production. The project is expected to create substantial economic opportunities, generating 140 high-paying permanent jobs along with various construction positions during the development phase. Local officials, including Gov. Andy Beshar (D) and Rep. James Comer (R), praised the initiative for its potential to position Kentucky as a leader in the nuclear energy sector and attended the plant’s ceremony to break ground.

General Matter is headed up by Scott Nolan, a partner at venture capital firm Founders Fund, which led the startup’s $50 million Series A round. In a rare move, Founders Fund CEO Peter Thiel has joined the company’s board. General Matter is bringing uranium enrichment back to the United States, starting at the site where the U.S. enrichment industry was born. We’ve signed a lease with the Department of Energy to establish the nation’s first U.S.-owned, privately developed uranium enrichment… pic.twitter.com/G30a9oTxrv — General Matter (@generalmatter) August 5, 2025 President Donald Trump has taken steps to bolster domestic critical mineral development, primarily through executive actions aimed at reducing U.S. reliance on foreign imports and enhancing national security. In March, the president signed an executive order — the \"Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production” — which invokes the Defense Production Act to provide financing, loans, and investment support for domestic mining and processing projects, including a dedicated critical minerals fund managed by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation in collaboration with the Department of Defense. In April, Trump signed an additional executive order focused on offshore critical minerals, aiming to develop domestic capabilities for seabed mineral exploration and processing to counter China’s influence. China's grip on the global rare earth supply chain spans from mine to magnet, positioning Beijing as the dominant force in materials critical to everything from wind turbines to military hardware. The world's second-largest economy produces 58% of light rare earths and commands 90% of heavy rare earth output, according to the Hudson Institute. Myanmar, an ally of Beijing, supplies the remaining 10% of heavy rare earths. China's stranglehold extends well beyond raw materials. The country processes 90% of rare earth ores worldwide and controls more than 80% of the market for rare earth magnets — the refined products that power electric vehicles, defense systems and renewable energy infrastructure.

    "fullContent": "Chinese Nationals Charged For Allegedly Exporting Microchips To China Without License Authored by Bill Pan via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Two Chinese nationals have been arrested in southern California for allegedly exporting tens of millions of dollars worth of “sensitive microchips” to China in violation of export controls, federal prosecutors said. Semiconductor chips on a circuit board of a computer, in this illustration picture taken on Feb. 25, 2022. Florence Lo/Reuters The U.S. Justice Department on Aug. 5 announced charges against Geng Chuan, 28, of Pasadena, California, and Yang Shiwei, 28, of El Monte, California, under the Export Control Reform Act, a felony offense punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Geng voluntarily surrendered to authorities on Aug. 2, while Yang was arrested earlier on the same day. The lawyers of Geng and Yang could not be reached for comment. According to the Justice Department, between October 2022 and July 2025, Geng and Yang used their El Monte-based company, ALX Solutions, to export advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to Singapore and Malaysia. Both countries are commonly used as transshipment points to conceal China as the ultimate destination. ALX Solutions did not receive payment for the chips from the purported recipients in Southeast Asia, prosecutors said. Instead, it was paid by companies in Hong Kong and China. Payments included a $1 million transaction from a China-based company in January 2024. The Justice Department did not specify the brand or model of chips involved but described them as “the most powerful GPU chips on the market,” explicitly designed for use in self-driving cars, medical diagnosis systems, and other applications powered by artificial intelligence. Such chips require a special export license from the U.S. Commerce Department before they can be legally shipped to China, a permission that ALX Solutions never applied for or obtained, according to prosecutors. Authorities said they found evidence suggesting that Geng and Yang allegedly attempted to evade export controls. “Last week, law enforcement searched ALX Solutions’ office and seized the phones belonging to Geng and Yang that revealed incriminating communications between the defendants, including communications about shipping export-controlled chips to China through Malaysia to evade U.S. export laws,” the Justice Department said in a statement. Geng, a U.S. lawful permanent resident, has been released on a $250,000 bond. Yang, who allegedly overstayed her visa, remains in custody, with a detention hearing scheduled for Aug. 12. Both defendants are scheduled to be arraigned on Sept. 11. In October 2022, the Biden administration imposed a set of export restrictions on advanced semiconductors and manufacturing equipment in an effort to slow the Chinese military’s artificial intelligence development and maintain U.S. leadership in this critical sector. In response, the Chinese Communist Party launched a massive campaign to both accelerate domestic chip innovation and circumvent export controls. In 2023, Chinese telecom giant Huawei unveiled its Mate 60 Pro smartphone, powered by a homegrown seven-nanometer chip—a milestone hailed by Beijing as a symbol of defiance. The phone’s release prompted the Biden administration to reflect on whether its sanctions were compromised. The Trump administration, while still maintaining strict controls on the most advanced semiconductor exports to China, has supported a strategy of allowing sales of lower-end U.S. chips, hoping to foster an ecosystem in which Chinese companies continue to rely on U.S. hardware and do not seek domestically produced alternatives.

    "fullContent": "Meet The Kansas \"Ghost Towns\" Where Houses Cost Less Than Half The Price Of A Tesla Homeownership may feel like a distant dream for many Americans, with the national median list price reaching $439,450 in July. But in rural Kansas, houses are selling for a fraction of that—some for less than half the $99,990 cost of a Tesla Cybertruck, according to a new article from Realtor.com. Driving through central-east Kansas, you’ll find quiet towns—Coldwater, Protection, Ashland, and Englewood—where populations have dropped by half since the 1930s. Many were once thriving farming or industrial hubs, but as industry shifted and agriculture became less profitable, residents left in search of more stable communities. Some towns are so small they barely qualify as towns anymore. Englewood, for example, has just 58 residents. Others, like Coldwater, still have over 1,000 people, but, as local real estate agent Jeff Simpson says, “It still gets sleepy pretty quick.” Simpson explains much of the decline is due to aging populations and youth migration: “You see a lot of people aging out of the farming communities, and their children have kind of left—either moved into suburban areas or out of state. So yeah, there’s certainly a little bit of a struggle going on there. We’re seeing homes sell for $50,000 to $85,000—especially old farmsteads that have been broken off larger parcels.” These emptying towns leave behind homes—time capsules of another era. Elizabeth Finkelstein, founder of Cheap Old Homes, notes, “A lot of these towns didn’t have the money to tear down and build new—so these homes survived. They’re like time capsules, filled with pink tile bathrooms and solid oak cabinets. They weren’t designed to impress—they were designed to last. The houses deserve to be preserved.” Listings include a $75,000 five-bedroom in Coldwater, a $40,000 five-bedroom in Ashland, and a $20,000 three-bedroom in Attica. Finkelstein highlights a historic Coldwater bungalow listed under $65,000, praising its durability: “Most of the wood is oak—one of the heaviest woods. These bungalows are so sturdy and built to last. Just to get the cabinetry today, that alone is half the cost of the house.” For buyers shut out of expensive urban markets, she calls these homes a rare opportunity: “No one in this country can afford houses right now—it’s completely ludicrous. Someone who’s done everything right still can’t afford to buy. This is a ticket into a real estate market that seems like a pipe dream. You can get in at a low closing cost and chip away at it slowly over time.” The Realtor.com piece notes that local agents also see potential beyond residential use. Simpson says Kansas’s landscapes are drawing out-of-state recreation seekers: “There’s a lot of out-of-state recreational users—pheasant and quail, the deer, the turkey. There’s a lot of hunting that happens in our area. If you can buy a farm for recreational use and there’s no place to stay, a decent little home nearby will get chewed up pretty quick.” Still, Finkelstein emphasizes that preservation matters: “The houses that get landmarked are usually where something extraordinary happened. But the homes in these towns were where everyday people lived and worked—and that’s actually our real history.” While the future of these “dying” towns is uncertain, revitalization is possible. Realtor.com Senior Economic Research Analyst Hannah Jones says, “‘Dying’ towns face prolonged population decline, disinvestment and economic contraction… While the future may seem grim for these towns, there are some strategies that could help manage their decline. Revitalization can happen, but it requires bringing job opportunities and people back to town, which can lead to investment and growth.” Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 21:20",

    "fullContent": "Sensex, Nifty, Share Prices LIVE: Indian equity markets are likely to open on a flattish note on Friday, as investors weigh the impact of new US tariffs against signs of domestic market resilience. US President Donald Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, pushing total duties to 50%, affecting key sectors like pharmaceuticals, textiles, electronics, and gems and jewellery. However, analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Manoranjan Sharma of Infomerics Ratings noted that India’s domestic-driven economy is well-positioned to absorb such shocks. Edelweiss MF’s Trideep Bhattacharya estimated the GDP impact at 0.5–0.7%. Meanwhile, Gift Nifty signals a flat start, and derivatives data shows bullish sentiment returning, with increased put writing at 24,500 levels. The Put-Call Ratio has risen sharply, while India VIX remains low at 11.68, pointing to consolidation rather than panic. Global cues are mixed, with Japan and Taiwan gaining and other Asia-Pacific markets trading lower, adding to the cautious mood.",

At 10:09 a.m., the Sensex declined 493 points to 80,130, while the Nifty shed 149 points to 24,446. Despite the drag, analysts remain cautiously optimistic, citing India’s strong domestic economic base. US President Donald Trump’s latest 25% tariff hike on Indian goods—doubling total levies to 50%—is expected to hit key export sectors such as gems & jewellery, textiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. Still, Dr. Manoranjan Sharma believes the Indian economy can weather the impact without severe disruption. Trideep Bhattacharya of Edelweiss MF estimates the GDP hit at 0.5–0.7%, warning of rising inflation and tighter producer margins ahead. However, the derivatives setup indicates improving sentiment, with put writers outpacing call writers and the Put-Call Ratio rising from 0.60 to 1.02. India VIX fell 2.28% to 11.68, reflecting expectations of market consolidation rather than panic.
