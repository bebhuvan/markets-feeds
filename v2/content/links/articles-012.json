    "fullContent": "Russian Nuclear Submarine Base Damaged By Tsunami, Satellite Images Reveal Last week's widely reported underwater earthquake off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula (on July 30) resulted in a tsunami which appears to have impacted the Rybachiy naval base, newly published satellite images show. Crucially the Rybachiy base is Russia's primary hub for nuclear submarines in the Pacific, and so was bound to feel some level of impact from an earthquake measuring 8.8 in magnitude which erupted just 140km away. International reports say that when the earthquake struck, two Yasen-class nuclear-powered attack submarines were observed docked at the base - and in the path of the tsunami; however, there's as yet no evidence of damage to the vessels themselves. Watch the visual comparison below: Instead, some of the base infrastructure has been observed as suffering damage, according to satellite imagery analysis featured in The Telegraph. \"A section of one pier has bent away from its original position, possibly indicating that it was detached from its moorings, images taken by the Umbra Space satellite on Thursday morning have revealed,\" the report says. \"It does not appear that a submarine was moored alongside at the time of impact and experts said damage to the structure alone would have little military significance,\" it adds, before concluding: \"However, questions were raised about whether the tsunami caused any further harm to the base, which was thought to have been hit within 15 minutes of the earthquake.\" The before and after satellite images featured by The Telegraph: In the aftermath last week, pictures and videos widely circulated online showing significant damage to buildings and other infrastructure, amid flooding, at various locations in Kamchatka, particularly at Pacific ports and harbors. Adding to worries about the area, the Klyuchevskaya Sopka volcano on the peninsula had also erupted. Images showed that tsunami waves flooded an area in Severo-Kurilsk, Sakhalin Region, Russia: Via Reuters According to The War Zone, \"Russia has been moving in recent years to replace all of its remaining Soviet-era Delta class SSBNs with Borei types. The Delta III class submarine Ryazan, also known by its hull number K-44, appears to still be present at Rybachiy based on available satellite imagery, but whether it is actually operational or not is unclear.\" Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 16:40",

    "fullContent": "'Cowardice & Dereliction Of Duty' - Texas Governor Orders Arrest Of Fleeing Democratic Lawmakers Update (1630ET): Promises made, promises kept... Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a controversial vote on new congressional maps. “Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans,” Abbott said in a statement Monday. “I ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to locate, arrest, and return to the House chamber any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans.” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is running for the Republican nomination for US Senate, said he supported the speedy arrest of “jet-setting runaways” who left the state during the legislative session. “This is cowardice and dereliction of duty, and they should face the full force of the law without apology,” Paxton said in a tweet. ...and cue the lawsuits. * * * Absconding to -- where else -- Chicago, Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives fled the state on Sunday to break a quorum and prevent a vote on a redistricting plan that promises to boost the GOP's share of seats in the US House of Representatives by five. In response, Gov. Greg Abbott threatened to remove them from office, replace them, and pursue felony charges against them, using extradition powers if need be. Texas state Rep. Jolanda “Jo” Jones (D) flips through maps during a public hearing Friday on congressional redistricting in Austin. (Eric Gay/AP) Their choice of exile location is positively drenched in hypocrisy, as Illinois arguably has the worst gerrymandering in America -- to Democrats' benefit, of course. In 2024, Democrats won 53% of the popular vote in Illinois House races, but took 82% of the seats (14 out of 17). This is the map Illinois Democrats drew. But I guess it’s a safe haven from gerrymandering now. https://t.co/isJazY56hQ pic.twitter.com/ozb6cMilcl — Dr. Rich McCormick for Congress (@RichforGA) August 3, 2025 A quorum is the minimum number of lawmakers present in order to conduct legislative business - a tactic they've used twice before in the 22 years since Republicans have controlled all of Texas state government (efforts which ultimately failed). The Democrats plan to stay away for two weeks to run the clock on a special legislative session called by Gov. Greg Abbott (R) in order to draw the new map. By state law, the Texas House can only conduct business when two-thirds of its 150 members are present, meaning at least 51 of the state's 62 Democrats will stay away. So far, 57 have fled the state, according to State Rep. Jon Rosenthal (D), with members fleeing to Chicago, Boston and New York. All plan to remain out of the state until Aug. 19, when the special session concludes. \"Our goal right now is to kill this session,\" said Rosenthal. Abbott said if the Democrats don't return by 3pm on Monday, he will invoke a Texas attorney general opinion and \"remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House,\" and then pick their successors under power granted in the state constitution. Upping the ante, Abbott said many of the fleeing Democrats may have committed felonies, as they're soliciting donations to cover fines they face under Texas House rules -- arguing that they risk bribery charges for accepting money \"to assist in the violation of legislative duties.\" To bring them to justice, he said \"I will use my full extradition authority to demand the return to Texas of any potential out-of-state felons.\" Texas AG Ken Paxton (R), meanwhile, has threatened to arrest lawmakers who break quorum, though he won't have jurisdiction over them outside of the state. The governor of gerrymandered Illinois is lecturing about gerrymandering and praising obstructionist TX Democrats who fled their state, and his state is now harboring: \"This is a righteous act of courage!\" pic.twitter.com/7mOiZv4cAR — Western Lensman (@WesternLensman) August 4, 2025 Democrats dismissed the threats. “As the Texas Supreme Court has acknowledged, it is the right of legislators to deny quorum,\" State Rep. Chris Turner told the Dallas Morning News. \"And as Governor Abbott should know, we also have separation of powers in this country.” \"Today this corruption ends,\" said state Rep. Gene Wu, chairman of the Democratic caucus in his chamber, at a Chicago presser at a county Democratic Party office attended by other Texas Democrats and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. “This is not a decision we make lightly, but it is one we make with absolute moral clarity. Governor Abbott...is using an intentionally racist map to steal the voices of millions of Black and Latino Texans, all to execute a corrupt political deal. Apathy is complicity, and we will not be complicit in the silencing of hard-working communities who have spent decades fighting for the power that Trump wants to steal.” Wu also accused Gov. Greg Abbott of making \"hostages\" out of the victims of last month's terrible floods in Kerrville, since the voting on the redistricting initiative was placed ahead of handling bills that would deliver financial aid to affected communities. The map has been swiftly advancing during the special legislative session that Abbott convened in July to handle the redistricting and flood response, among many other issues. Texans deserve better! I won’t help pass a racist map drawn by Donald Trump and Washington D.C. to silence the voices of Texans. #txlege #redistricting pic.twitter.com/BjLe6BTpqL — Rep Ramón (@RepRamonRomero) August 3, 2025 That said, Wu admitted he didn't know what Texas Democrats would do if Abbott calls another special session after this one. \"We don’t know what the next steps are,\" he said. Texas House Democrats are screened before boarding their flight to Chicago on Sunday (Bob Daemmrich for The Texas Tribune) Republican leaders say the new map is a necessary correction, noting that the state’s population growth has warranted mid-decade changes. But Democrats contend the proposal is a blatant partisan power grab, part of a broader Republican effort in several states to shore up congressional majorities before what is expected to be a volatile midterm season. Texas Republicans currently control 25 of the state’s 38 congressional seats; the new map would likely give them 30, all of which Mr. Trump carried by at least 10 percentage points in 2024. The GOP holds a narrow 219-212 majority in the U.S. House, with four vacancies, and party leaders see Texas as central to preserving their legislative agenda. Before the map was unveiled, President Trump said he favored “a very simple redrawing” that would give Republicans more seats. “We pick up five seats [in Texas] but we have a couple other states where we’ll pick up seats also,” he said last month. Texas state Representative Todd Hunter, a Republican and sponsor of the legislation, called the proposal “a good plan for Texas” and said, “The primary changes … are focused on five districts for partisan purposes.” DNC Chair Ken Martin - of the party that continually floats packing the Supreme Court when they don't get their way - said, “Republicans thought they could just rig the maps and change the rules without the American people taking notice. They were dead wrong.” Former Attorney General Eric Holder said Sunday on ABC that Democrats might “have to do things that perhaps in the past I would not have supported” in response to the Texas plan. “I think we need to respond in kind,” said Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas, and chair of the Democratic Governors Association. The new Texas map, unveiled last week under pressure from Trump and Abbott, was approved by a legislative committee on Saturday and was expected to reach the House floor on Tuesday. In a separate development that could have profound implications for redistricting battles across America, the US Supreme Court last week said it will consider the constitutionality of redistricting that's intentionally aimed at creating \"majority-minority districts\" with the goal securing power for blacks and Hispanics. In that Louisiana case filed by self-described \"non-African American voters,\" claiming a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, the high court said it will examine whether that kind of redistricting violates the 14th or 15th Amendments to the US Constitution. In April 2024, a federal panel of judges in the US District Court for the Western District of Louisiana ruled that purposefully creating a majority-black district was \"an impermissible racial gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” The 15th Amendment bars governments from denying or abridging the right to vote based on race or color.

    "summary": "Suspicious Minds",
    "fullContent": "Suspicious Minds Authored by James Howard Kunstler, \"It was a coup, and I'm using that term literally ... One egregious felony after another.\" - Stephen Miller America is tired of being driven insane, of having absurdities crammed into our collective consciousness. Reality is an agreement about what is going on in the world. That act of faith requires such an agreement be based on what is demonstrably true. Without it, society dissolves into chaos and failure. The RussiaGate psychodrama is about an agreement based on lies. It started with Hillary Clinton’s desperate ploy to save her foundering 2016 election campaign. Her emails somehow got sent to Wikileaks, a radical news org dedicated to revealing government secrets, implicating misconduct. It was easy to declare the Russians did it, by hacking — when it was much more likely, in fact, proven by a forensic audit, that a Clinton campaign insider downloaded the info on a thumb drive, perhaps one Seth Rich, found murdered on a DC sidewalk soon thereafter. Every lie after that met the kind of skepticism among the public that generates heat, controversy, scandal, and fire. Hillary managed to enlist President Barack Obama and his executive agencies into her project, and the party apparatus with it, because the Clinton Victory Fund had paid the DNC’s debts and took over its management. Soon, the Russia collusion project grew into a gigantic scaffold of flaming lies. The big newspapers and the TV news networks bought the story, and came along for the ride. They were all sure Hillary would win the 2016 election. All the heat and fire would get flushed away. The polls all said so. The agencies and the parties would pick up and go on as before, run the show, make careers, get wealthy, be important! They miscalculated. They lost. But they decided to keep building the scaffold of lies in order to protect themselves from the danger it represented — because they lived in that scaffold, it was the party’s house. And the scaffold of lies needed massive fortification. The house that the party lived in had to be protected at all costs, or they would all be cast out, homeless, a whole party on street, lost, broke, ruined, dying, like the pitiful tweakers bent over out on Kensington Avenue in Philly, in every Democrat-run city, really. And so, they undermined the winner of the election at every turn, worked furiously to drive him from office, made a plague happen, subverted the 2020 election, and spent four years under a fake president jamming absurdities into the public arena, turning it into a freak show, one drag-queen story hour after another, from sea to shining sea. All to defeat the return of a public consensus about reality based on what is demonstrably true — starting with the fact that there are men and there are women, and that the primary interaction between them keeps society going by producing offspring. This enormous, drawn-out insurrection, composed of serial felony crimes, amounts to the greatest insult against the republic — the res publica, in Latin, the public thing — in the nation’s history. And now it is coming apart as an overwhelming majority of citizens, including now many Democrats, can’t avoid discovering what has happened in the country. Because lies are weak and the truth is sturdy and eventually truth prevails, even after an arduous struggle. The old news media complex, the networks and the papers, are not reporting the recent disclosures by the Directors of the CIA, the FBI, and National Intel. What will it take to get their attention? Arrests and perp-walks of formerly important officials? And then, do they acknowledge and atone for their disgraceful participation in the events? Or pretend they couldn’t figure any of it out for years and years? Poor us, we didn’t know! Suddenly, it looks like many of these “legacy” news outfits are going out-of-business. They’re throwing their performers over the side like sinking ships casting off so much useless ballast. You knew this was coming, right? Now, here you are: the hour that consequence finally returns from its wanderings in a wilderness of institutional failure. There’s no evading it anymore. The scaffold of lies has collapsed, and trying to add additional lies will amount to throwing a few twigs on a heap of smoldering wreckage. The institutions themselves are under new management, and they show every sign of returning to regular operation, doing what they were designed to do in the first place: deliver a truthful account of what has happened and determine a just consequence for the people who made it happen. It’s going to happen, and then we can rebuild a coherent public consensus about what is really real, who we really are, and where we go from here. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 16:20",

    "fullContent": "To Kill An Operation Mockingbird: Tulsi Goes To War With The CIA's Propaganda Yobbos Authored by Kevin Downey Jr via PJMedia.com, Former Democratic Party presidential hopeful and current Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is giving the CIA an enema, and she's putting the hose where it is most needed: in the sketchy, unofficial offices of Operation Mockingbird, the CIA's not-so-secret department dedicated to propaganda. The CIA has been bribing/threatening/installing journalists to do their bidding since the beginning of the Cold War. It is believed they had/have roughly 400 journalists, news reporters, and publishers throughout the world, writing what the CIA tells them to write. In the mid-1970s, Operation Mockingbird was exposed by the Church Committee, led by Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho). The committee found that the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and various other alphabet agencies were illegally bugging, wiretapping, and harassing people, even Americans, the most notable of whom was Martin Luther King, Jr. The Church Committee slapped the CIA on the wrist and told them to end Operation Mockingbird, but, exasperatingly, the committee didn't provide any oversight to make sure that Mockingbird was dead. According to the Church Committee Report on Foreign and Military Intelligence of 1976 (page 455), Mockingbird thrives to this day. Watch Robert Kennedy, Jr. explain how some of the fake news crims, including Rolling Stone and Vox, are nothing more than CIA-run rumor mills. So that leads us to where we are now. Tulsi Gabbard believes Operation Mockingbird isn't merely still alive and kicking, but that it's being used to slander President Trump. 9In my opinion, it is also being used to spread globalist codswallop.) Even better, Gabbard is dedicated to tearing it down. SCARY: Tulsi Gabbard CONFIRMS That ‘Operation Mockingbird’ is STILL Ongoing inside the CIA and she is actively trying to Shut it Down. Tulsi says Deep State intel agents are still actively colluding with left-wing media outlets to attack President Trump from within: “There are… pic.twitter.com/CZWMERFsa3 — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) July 31, 2025 What you're about to see is not comedy. It's tragically cringeworthy propaganda being progenerated by a globalist shill who needs to be drummed out of the comedy community forever. Welcome to late-night brainwashing, courtesy of, I believe, Operation Mockingbird: Watch former CIA Director John Brennan squirm like a worm under the magnifying glass of the Trump administration's take-down of swamp wigglers like himself: 🚨BREAKING: Former CIA Director John Brennan confirmed @DNIGabbard's claim that Operation Mockingbird remains active. He stuttered after realizing what he just said. \"Intelligence really undergirds a lot of the political efforts underway...\" pic.twitter.com/xG9NLbXmja — Gunther Eagleman™ (@GuntherEagleman) August 1, 2025 DNI Gabbard claims she is dedicated to ending the unofficial \"Operation Mockingbird.\" I can't be more giddy. I suspect there are no hallway signs at the Pentagon stating \"Operation Mockingbird Offices This Way,\" and thus stabbing the problem in its heart may prove difficult. Operation Mockingbird is likely why your hirsute thing-in-law believes Trump said to take \"horse pills\" to beat COVID, which came from a bat salad, and so many other lies we've seen pushed by the media. Operation Mockingbird gave us all of this flapdoodle: pic.twitter.com/KzmE9CaG1F — The Kevin Downey, Jr. Show Mon- Fri. 9-11 am EST! (@KDJRadioShow) August 3, 2025 I believe the darker threat isn't fake news, but the seemingly unquenchable thirst for more of the same. Killing Operation Mockingbird is integral, but teaching leftoids they've been lied to for decades is the true challenge. Watch this video, and the meaning of the name \"Operation Mockingbird\" will become terrifyingly clear: Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 15:25",

That’s according to journalist Mark Halperin, who claims Biden loyalists have a store of embarrassing stories they’re holding back but will make public should Harris negatively reference Biden’s cognitive decline. It’s now common knowledge that Biden’s camp, particularly his wife, despise Harris for going along with the Democratic Party coup against Joe. Biden allies prepared to unload ‘Palinesque’ stories about Kamala Harris if she discusses his cognitive decline: report https://t.co/wkCzzxmhCW pic.twitter.com/Wd4KNyOoZs — New York Post (@nypost) August 2, 2025 In an appearance on The Morning Meeting show, Halperin stated “I will tell you, and this has never been reported, barely at all: if the Biden people decide that Kamala Harris is coming after Joe Biden, wait till you hear the ‘Palinesque’ stories about how much they tried to help her be prepared to be vice president and be in a position to run.” Halperin further claimed that the details will expose “How much they decided, ‘Not happening. She’s not up to this.’” “If the Biden people feel threatened, you will hear stories about Kamala Harris as Vice President that will not make her look good,” Halperin urged. “It’s not like they’re at war currently, but I’m telling you, if Joe Biden feels threatened, if his people feel threatened by her, this is gonna escalate in a big way,” he added. Halperin further asserted that the Biden inner circle pulled out all the stops “in trying to help her do the job of vice president.” “They gave her every opportunity. And they did — they found in some instances that she had some issues,” he emphasized. Yeah, we noticed. Harris announced the upcoming memoir this week with several bizarre cackling social media posts and appearances reminding the entire world just how much of a bullet we all dodged. Meanwhile, one of Biden’s top aides Mike Donilon has revealed that he made a whopping $4 million working for him in 2024 alone. According to Axios, Donilon was also slated to receive another $4 million if Biden was somehow able to get reelected. The details came out in closed-door testimony to the House Oversight Committee which is investigating the cover up of Biden’s cognitive decline.

    "fullContent": "Netanyahu Has Reportedly Opted For Permanent Military Occupation Of Gaza Israel's Channel 12 broadcaster is reporting that the Israeli government has made the decision to occupy the Gaza Strip on a permanent basis. Correspondent Amit Segal reports Monday, \"Senior official in Netanyahu’s office: The decision has been made — we’re going to occupy Gaza.\" Via euromedmonitor.org The top official has been further quoted as saying: \"If we do not act now, hostages will die of starvation and Gaza will remain under Hamas control.\" But the last days have seen conflicting reports over the status and future of the ground operation, dubbed 'Gideon's Chariots'. What has become clear in the last week is that negotiations are off, as Prime Minister Netanyahu ordered an expanded ground incursion in central Gaza. With much of the Strip already decimated, and inhabitants on the verge of mass starvation, a big question has remained for Netanyahu: what's next? Hardline politicians in his own cabinet have called for the total removal of the Palestinian population, after President Trump months ago talked about turning the enclave into the 'Rivera of the Mediterranean'. Indeed a key question remains, will Trump back a plan of permanent Israeli military occupation? This would certainly open up the likelihood of eventual annexation of the territory. ⚡️ Israel decides to ‘OCCUPY’ Gaza — Channel 12 Top official: ‘If we do not act now, hostages will DIE of starvation and Gaza will remain under Hamas control’ Will Trump support this? pic.twitter.com/vuQFFEg1mg — RT (@RT_com) August 4, 2025 But without doubt, a Hamas insurgency will remain active for the time being. But the race will be on to save the remaining hostages, who have been filmed in starving and extreme conditions by their Hamas and Islamic Jihad captors. Also on Monday, US House Speaker Mike Johnson travelled to the Israeli occupation settlement of Ariel in the West Bank, declaring while there that the Palestinian territory is the \"rightful property\" of the Jewish people. mike johnson, who literally shut down the house last week to block the release of the epstein files, is now praying at the western wall in a yarmulke… pic.twitter.com/TV3XUe1HzR — Jon Miller (@MillerStream) August 3, 2025 In response, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry (PA) condemned his visit and \"inflammatory statements on the annexation of the West Bank.\" It further said, \"The ministry considers this a blatant violation of international law, international legitimacy resolutions, and the Arab and American efforts to stop the war, halt the cycle of violence, and achieve calm.\" Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 15:05",

    "fullContent": "Don't Overlook Hillary Clinton Authored by Kenin Spivak via RealClearPolitics, Before Barack Obama’s CIA Director John Brennan and 50 other intelligence analysts deceived Americans in the run-up to the 2020 election by warning that Hunter Biden’s laptop had “all the earmarks of a classic Russian information operation” – and before Obama, Brennan, Obama’s FBI Director James Comey, and National Intelligence Director James Clapper falsified an Intelligence Community Assessment in December 2016 to destabilize Donald Trump’s first term – there was Hillary Clinton. The media’s focus these days is on President Trump’s possible cameo in the so-called “Epstein files” and Obama’s role in advancing the Russia collusion hoax. These stories crossed when DNI Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe released compelling evidence that six weeks before his term concluded, Obama pressed the intelligence community to ignore its previous assessments and instead rely on the sham Steele dossier and an ambiguous and unverifiable sentence fragment to smear Trump and undermine his presidency before it began. But let’s not forget the Clinton campaign’s role in this kabuki dance. Clinton, not Obama, was Trump’s opponent in the 2016 election. As we learned last week from the declassification of reports issued by Gabbard and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, the weight of the heretofore concealed evidence is that if Putin had a preference, it was most likely Clinton – not the wildcard first-time officeholder who surprised the world by winning. According to the now declassified September 2020 majority staff report of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Putin’s principal goal was to undermine faith in the U.S. democratic process, not help any particular candidate. Thus, he chose not to leak the most compromising allegations about Clinton, presumably so that he could later use them to weaken her expected presidency. If Russia really wanted to help Trump, the purported information – whether true or not – would have been released during the campaign. The intelligence community and media, which did have a clear favorite in 2016, carefully hid the compromising accusations, including secret meetings in which State Department representatives are alleged to have unlawfully offered assistance to religious groups in exchange for their support in the 2016 election, along with emails from Democratic National Committee officials describing Clinton’s “psycho-emotional problems,” including “uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression, and cheerfulness.” Clinton was said by these sources to be on a daily regimen of “heavy tranquilizers.” Recently declassified intelligence files show that Clinton authorized the bogus Steele dossier during the 2016 campaign to deflect attention from her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state, and to discredit Trump. Obama, his senior intelligence team and Democratic leadership used the dossier to push the dishonest Russia narrative, Trump’s first impeachment, and a largely successful effort to block his first-term agenda. Just a year earlier, a bombshell New York Times report disclosed that Clinton breached core security protocols by exclusively using a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. She may have done so to shield emails about improper Clinton Foundation fundraising efforts, her hiring of private consultants, and other political conflicts. In a highly inappropriate press conference before the 2016 election, Jim Comey took it upon himself to excuse Clinton’s security lapses, curiously asserting that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring a criminal case. An investigation led by Chairman Grassley found that Comey intended to exonerate Clinton even before the FBI interviewed her. On July 21, 2025, Grassley released a long buried June 2018 FBI Inspector General report that concluded the FBI never fully investigated Clinton’s use of the private server. Further, contrary to sound investigative protocols, witnesses were permitted to attend each other’s depositions, and no action was taken when Clinton’s lawyers accessed confidential information, or when her aides used hammers to destroy BlackBerry phones and BleachBit software to erase the emails. According to Grassley, then-DNC chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz confirmed that Obama scuttled the investigation to protect Clinton’s candidacy. When Clinton served as Obama’s secretary of state, foreign governments and corporations donated hundreds of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and paid Bill Clinton premium prices for speeches, including governments that obtained substantial State Department assistance. Clinton personally attended meetings with foundation donors and sought favors for them, a practice begun when she was New York’s junior senator. Bill Clinton’s White House run was rocked by allegations over investments Bill and Hillary made in the Whitewater Development Corporation. Despite the disappearance of key documents from the White House private quarters, evidence of Hillary’s questionable activities, and the conviction of one of their business partners, neither Clinton faced prosecution. In 1978 and 1979, while first lady of Arkansas, Clinton invested $1,000 in cattle futures, generating almost $100,000 in profit in less than a year. Despite suspicions suggesting that the profits were disguised pay-offs from Tyson Foods and the improbability of such returns, there was no official investigation. While Hillary Clinton’s time on the national stage may be sunsetting, she remains the epitome of the disparate standards to which Republicans and Democrats are held by American elites. Kenin M.

    "fullContent": "Kremlin Urges 'Careful Use Of Nuclear Rhetoric' As Medvedev Pivots To Saying Trump Blackmailed By Mossad The Kremlin has issued a fresh statement urging caution in making public statements involving nuclear weapons, after last week President Trump ordered two US nuclear submarines to deploy \"closer to Russia\". Seeking to downplay tensions, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated of the ultra-provocative American sub deployment, \"in this case, it is obvious that American submarines are already on combat patrol. This is a constant process.\" He stressed that Moscow would prefer not to engage in such discourse or \"get involved in such a controversy in any way,\" according to state media. AFP via Getty Images \"We are very careful about any statements related to nuclear issues\" given that \"Russia takes a responsible position\" and is \"very attentive to the topic of nuclear non-proliferation,\" he added. He said that on the nuclear issue, \"the main thing, of course, is the position of President Putin\" - suggesting that he is the final, responsible decision-maker on use of strategic doctrine. \"We believe that everyone should be very, very careful with nuclear rhetoric,\" Peskov then emphasized further. Interestingly it was Trump himself who last week accused former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev of throwing around nuclear threats lightly. Medvedev - who currently serves deputy chair of the country's Security Council - made reference to atomic apocalypse in written social media remarks about the Ukraine war and standoff with Washington. \"Well, a former president of Russia who's now in charge of one of the most important councils, Medvedev, said some things that were very bad, talking about nuclear,\" Trump had said in a follow-up interview about the matter. Trump continued, \"And when you mention the word 'nuclear,' you know, my eyes light up and I say, 'We better be careful,' because it's the ultimate threat.\" So now it appears at least both rivals are on the same page - with Moscow and Washington simultaneously calling for the dialing back of all nuclear rhetoric. But this doesn't mean that Medvedev is done going after Trump in this latest tit-for-tat social media public war or words. He put the following out Monday on Telegram: “Trump should not think that the video archive of his past immoralities is only in the hands of Mossad.” This is to apparently suggest strongly that Trump's foreign policy actions are directed by Israel, in connection with Epstein-related blackmail, and is among the more bizarre and aggressive theories thrown out there by Medvedev of late. 🚨 Medvedev: “Trump shouldn’t think the video archive of his past immoralities is only in Mossad’s hands.” 🇷🇺⚠️🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/4MPSuCldSk — Daily Iran News (@DailyIranNews) August 3, 2025 For all of this to cool down, it will probably take Trump not responding to this latest provocative statement and insult by Medvedev. Given he's long sought to ignore and bat down the Epstein case, there's a good chance that Trump will let this statement pass without firing back. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 14:25",
