Speaking to reporters after the raid, Ben Gvir said: <strong>\"The Temple Mount is for the Jews, and we will remain here forever.\"</strong></p> <p>Since becoming a minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, Ben Gvir has led at least 11 assaults on the mosque. Meanwhile, several other far-right politicians have <strong>advocated for the destruction of Al-Aqsa and the construction of a temple where they claim Jewish temples once stood</strong>.</p> <p>Among the hundreds of people to take part in Sunday's raid was right-wing Likud lawmaker Amit Halevi, who has repeatedly advocated for Israel to destroy all water, food and energy sources in Gaza.</p> <p>In June 2023, he tabled a bill that would divide Al-Aqsa Mosque between Muslims and Jews, a plan that would see shared access from the courtyard of the Dome of the Rock to the end of the northern border of Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p> <p>Palestinians fear that the incursions at Al-Aqsa, which have intensified since Israel went to war on Gaza in October 2023, are laying the groundwork for the mosque to be divided similar to how the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron was in the 1990s.</p> <p>Muslims currently have limited access to that site, and just last month, Israel transferred the authority of the mosque from the Palestinian-run Hebron municipality to a settler council.</p> <p>Aouni Bazbaz, the director of international affairs at the Islamic Waqf, the organisation that administers Al-Aqsa Mosque, described Sunday's raid as \"painful and regrettable\", telling MEE that it was a threat to the \"historical status quo and an incitement to violence\".</p> <p>\"There were terrifying numbers of people [Israeli settlers] present and some were important figures,\" he said. \"This was part of a project. The extreme religious right seeks to undermine the status quo and to clearly follow the example of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.</p> <p>\"There are no worshippers here right now, the place is empty, the Old City is empty. <strong>It's a military barracks</strong>,\" he added.</p> <p>The Jerusalem Governorate also decried the raid, and appealed to the international community, in particular Muslim states, \"to take immediate action\".</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir sparked fresh outrage today after performing Talmudic rituals inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, accompanied by an associate who carried out the “epic prostration”, a form of Jewish worship explicitly prohibited at the site <a href=\"https://t.co/pv3aKSaJvc\">pic.twitter.com/pv3aKSaJvc</a></p> — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MiddleEastEye/status/1951940076071473266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>\"What happened today is not just a traditional incursion.

As with previous actions, the protests were primarily <strong>attended by crazed, elderly white liberals</strong>. The Democrats and their NGO machine have lost not just the narrative but are drifting deeper into irrelevance. </p> <p>50501 (\"50 Protests, 50 States, 1 Movement\") is part of the <strong>permanent protest-industrial complex</strong> and was behind the underwhelming demonstrations this weekend. The group's mission is to organize large-scale, <strong>nationwide color revolution-style operations against President Trump</strong>, including these previous events:</p> <ul><li> <p><em>February 5: Anti-Trump kickoff rallies </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>February 17 (Presidents' Day): \"No Kings on Presidents Day\"</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>March 4: Third round of demonstrations</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>April 5: \"Hands Off\" protests, among the largest anti-Trump protests </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>June 14: \"No Kings\"</em></p> </li> </ul><p><strong>Each of the nationwide protests listed above has failed to generate enough momentum</strong> to shift public opinion and move the polls. The dark-money-funded NGOs behind the permanent protest-industrial complex have grown increasingly frustrated; so much so that they reportedly offered $20 million to a 'rent-a-protester' firm. </p> <p>Last month, Adam Swart, CEO of an activist group called \"Crowds on Demand\", called out one unnamed leftist entity ...</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"</em><strong><em>We had to reject an offer worth around $20 million for nationwide, large-scale demonstrations across the country.

If signed into law, the Blackburn bill would deliver on that promise.</p> <p>While China is the primary target, the legislation would also prohibit purchases from North Korea, Iran, and Russia.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/500EB027-1844-468F-9757-F58AA0D5DD90\">The second bill</a> focuses on the capital city:</strong> It would require the District of Columbia to end so-called “sister city” arrangements with adversarial nations. Washington, D.C., has entered into no less than 15 non-formal arrangements with cities around the world. Some are innocuous, such as Athens and Paris. One is a relic of hopes not realized.</p> <p>Then-Mayor Marion Barry signed the Washington-Beijing Sister City Friendship agreement in 1984 when the U.S. still hoped that normalizing relations with China would lead to liberalization. It did not. Blackburn and other Republicans now warn that “sister city” arrangements, while informal, provide an adversarial regime a sort of soft power through diplomatic legitimacy and access to sensitive U.S. institutions.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/369F964E-58D8-4FAC-8AD9-591CDF6D995A\">The third bill</a> would require the Department of Housing and Urban Development to work with state and local governments to assess whether and how foreign buyers, including those using shell corporations, “are distorting U.S. housing markets and threatening national security.”</strong></p> <p>The legislation comes as Trump shakes up the world stage through a series of new trade deals and reevaluated alliances. Even as the president insists that U.S. relations with China are improving, his administration has taken steps to gain an upper hand in the rivalry with the communist superpower. He has bolstered military spending. He has deregulated the artificial intelligence industry in order to maintain U.S. dominance in that field. He insists that the United States will remain preeminent.</p> <p>Perhaps most significantly, Trump made a rising China a bipartisan concern. While previous administrations cast a wary eye on an increasingly bellicose Beijing, his first candidacy thrust the issue front and center nearly a decade ago. And former President Joe Biden did not throttle back during his time in office, notably keeping Trump’s tariffs on China in place and describing the coming century as a competition between autocracy and democracy.</p> <p><strong>Blackburn shares those concerns. Her current effort focuses on the domestic front.</strong></p> <p>“The United States cannot allow foreign adversaries like Communist China to quietly embed themselves in our communities and near our critical infrastructure,” the senator told RCP.</p> <p>“We have a responsibility to identify and address these threats,” Blackburn added, before describing her legislative practice as an effort that “shines a light on these activities and will help protect American property and sovereignty.”</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T18:00:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 14:00</span>",

Araghchi said that his message to Witkoff has been that there needs to be a “win-win” deal and that the US needs to show real “confidence-building” measures.</p> <p>“The road to negotiation is narrow but<strong> it’s not impossible</strong>. I need to convince my hierarchy that if we go for negotiation, the other side is coming with real determination for a win-win deal,” he said.</p> <p>The US has also shown no sign that it’s willing to give Iran assurances that it won’t be attacked again, since President Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb the country again if it restarts its nuclear enrichment program. Araghchi reaffirmed that Tehran wouldn’t agree to a deal that doesn’t allow it to enrich uranium at low levels.</p> <p>“We can negotiate, they can present their argument and we will present our own argument,” Araghchi said.<strong> “But with zero enrichment, we don’t have a thing,”</strong> Araghchi.</p> <p>He also reaffirmed that Iran didn’t want a nuclear bomb and would continue to abide by a 2003 fatwa from the Iranian Supreme Leader that prohibited the production of nuclear weapons.</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T16:50:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 12:50</span>",

This full-blown affordability crisis is hollowing out the middle class from within. Add years of mass migration of millions of illegal aliens, and the wealth and opportunities once available to the native population have eroded even further. It's becoming impossible to ignore that many policymakers in Washington, seemingly aligned with the globalist billionaires, have deliberately waged economic war on America's middle class. This is precisely why President Trump rose to power. </p> <p>Two of the core bedrocks of the middle class include homeownership and family formation. These two pillars provide economic stability, social cohesion, and long-term investment that sustain a prosperous and resilient society. </p> <p>Alarm bells have been sounded, and the Trump administration had better be paying attention, because a new chart that shows the estimated percentage of 30-year-olds in the U.S. who are both married and homeowners, spanning from 1950 to a projected 2025, has completely collapsed.</p> <p>The chart was first posted on X by Nathan Halberstadt of New Founding, who stated this is a \"<a href=\"https://x.com/NatHalberstadt/status/1951854992995889187\">critical civilizational problem</a>.\" </p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">I’ve heard the horror stories, Carol. <a href=\"https://t.co/EexiHD5zsf\">https://t.co/EexiHD5zsf</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/35736Jw06P\">pic.twitter.com/35736Jw06P</a></p> — Nathan Halberstadt 🧊 (@NatHalberstadt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NatHalberstadt/status/1951635776900415724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>Halberstadt is correct: Young Americans can't afford homes, can't start families, and increasingly see the American Dream as just a dream. This has given rise to socialism and Marxism, spreading across the nation like cancer. It's as if the globalist elite in Washington deliberately sabotaged the middle class over the years, hollowing it out with decades of destructive policies designed to break those key pillars. </p> <p>This chart was enough for Elon Musk to respond with \"!!\" as he, too, understands there needs to be a drastic and sharp course correction or risk losing the country to socialists and Marxists. </p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"qam\" xml:lang=\"qam\" xml:lang=\"qam\">!!</p> — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1951928568893583635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>The reason Communism failed to take hold in the U.S. in the 1960s post-WWII is that the economic expansion had stable jobs, rising wages, access to homeownership, and upward mobility.

Vance with ensuring that no funding went to “exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy.”</p> <p>The Smithsonian’s announcement on Friday came as another publicly funded nonprofit under fire for its political bias announced that it was closing shop.</p> <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which bankrolled outlets like <a href=\"https://headlineusa.com/tag/npr\">NPR</a> and <a href=\"https://headlineusa.com/tag/pbs\">PBS</a> through its congressional grants, announced its closure following Congress’s passage of the Rescissions Act last month, which clawed back some $9 billion in partisan public funding and <a href=\"https://headlineusa.com/tag/federal-spending\">spending</a> excesses.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">BREAKING: The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is shutting down citing loss of federal funding. <a href=\"https://t.co/JmmJ92J9NG\">pic.twitter.com/JmmJ92J9NG</a></p> — ALX 🇺🇸 (@alx) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alx/status/1951343528652710024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>CPB stood to lose $1.1 billion from the rollback, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/18/nx-s1-5469912/npr-congress-rescission-funding-trump\">according to NPR</a>.</p> <p>Leftists lashed out following the legislation’s passage, insisting—despite a <a href=\"https://headlineusa.com/25-year-npr-vet-admits-far-left-coverage/\">preponderance of evidence</a> to the contrary—that it was nonpartisan and that its programming performed a critical service to the public interest.</p> <p>“Parents and children, senior citizens and students, tribal and rural communities—all will bear the harm of this vote,” said <a href=\"https://headlineusa.com/tag/katherine-maher\">Katherine Maher</a>, NPR’s president and CEO, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/18/g-s1-78150/unprecedented-rescission-bill-defunds-public-media\">in a statement</a> responding to the cuts.</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T15:40:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 11:40</span>",

Churches in this southern area have also been burned and destroyed.</p> <p data-end=\"484\" data-start=\"227\">This has brought Damascus under greater international scrutinty and spotlight, though Washington has tended to overlook the atrocities carried out also against Christians and Alawites. However, the <strong>US did oversee the initial truce which now appears in shambles due to this latest fighting</strong>.</p> <p data-end=\"484\" data-start=\"227\">The southern Syria region is poised to unravel, also as Israel appears engaged in <strong>more land-grab</strong> <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/one-killed-after-armed-groups-attack-syrian-security-forces-sweida\">activity</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>A security source told the outlet the armed groups had violated a ceasefire agreed in the predominantly Druze region, which has seen more than 1,000 killed in fighting over the past month.</em></p> <p><em>Violence in Sweida erupted on 13 July between Bedouin fighters, Druze factions and government forces. Israel also carried out strikes on Syrian cities, claiming they were coming to the assistance of the Druze.</em></p> </blockquote> <p data-end=\"1674\" data-start=\"1398\">According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based anti-Assad monitoring group, the Sweida clashes left one Druze fighter dead and at least nine others wounded. The violence occurred at the Tal al-Hadeed heights, a strategic area overlooking neighboring Daraa province, the latter long being a hotbed of unrest.</p> <p data-end=\"1674\" data-start=\"1398\">In the north, the HTS-run Syrian Defense Ministry claimed that SDF rocket attacks injured three civilians and four soldiers.

I find it a little frustrating to read this, because in Europe it does not feel like we are getting a free ride at all. In fact it seems like the opposite: <em><strong>The most common complaint on the populist German right is that our political class refuses to represent our interests and will not stop carrying water for the Americans.</strong></em></p> <p>I recognise that I’ll never be able to put this right, but it’s worth trying, because it is important to understand the world as it is. The truth is that the United States is an imperial power. Generally speaking, it does not give foreign nations free rides and it does not hand out unearned favours. <strong>There is however a lot of confusion here, because hardly anybody bothers to describe honestly the geopolitical strategy pursued by the United States or the nature of the American empire. </strong></p> <p>Western liberalism cannot conceptualise imperial politics, and while empire generally benefits political elites on both sides of the Atlantic, it is not necessarily or always in the interests of ordinary Americans or ordinary Europeans, which is yet another reason not to talk about it.</p> <p><strong>The Americans and the British before them expended enormous effort to preempt the emergence of a dominant power on the European Continent that might challenge their successive naval empires.</strong> They fought two world wars to stop Germany from becoming just such a power. This great struggle ended in 1945 with Western Europe as a fully subjugated imperial province. Since then, the Americans have coordinated the NATO alliance and guaranteed the security of European countries not out of charity, but because Europe is their provincial possession. As a rule, they have not wanted Europe to assume full responsibility for its own defence, because a world in which America no longer guarantees the security of Europe is a world in which Europe is no longer an American province. It’s that simple.</p> <p>To fend off the Soviets, the Americans nevertheless rebuilt and rearmed the nations of Western Europe. Everyone involved in this project had to come up with a way to allow the Germans to become a dominant economic power again, without displacing the United States or provoking the hostilities of wary postwar neighbours like France. <strong>One solution here was the European Union, which promoted economic interdependency as a counterweight to nationalist concerns. </strong>Another solution came at the cultural level, where Germany sought to allay European anxieties over possible Teutonic aggression by developing a national cult of historical guilt for World War II, which steadily blossomed into a full-blown civic religion. This exercise in self-effacement has grown more and not less extreme over time, in part as a response to nervousness about the consequences of German reunification. Many voices on the right like to portray Germans as victims of an externally imposed guilt regime, but the truth is that we did most of this to ourselves. The German left in particular has profited from and encouraged this mindset from the beginning.</p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"https://store.zerohedge.com/multi-function-survival-flashlight/\" data-image-href=\"https://store.zerohedge.com/multi-function-survival-flashlight/\" data-link-option=\"2\" href=\"https://store.zerohedge.com/multi-function-survival-flashlight/\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b895d05f-00e6-438f-acec-93b26b9313e2\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"289\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/survival%20flashlightJPG_0.jpg?itok=x5lhZCBz\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p> <p>German political self-effacement had one unexpected feature, in that it proved to be contagious. <strong>Within a generation of 1945, many of the victorious allied powers were striving to develop their own historical guilt cults after the German example, in each case centred around a national original sin like slavery or colonialism.</strong> Just as the German political class found it expedient to foreground collective European concerns at the expense of a more narrowly construed German nationalism, so did the broader West develop an overarching obsession with global issues and the plight of the developing world. This has caused the proliferation of a lot of silly people in our political culture, a lot of profoundly stupid organisations, and at least two cancerous ideological systems in the form of climatism and migrationism. We have had a nearly incalculable gift in the form of 80 years of peace, which may yet be offset by the equally incalculable costs of the lunacies this peace has encouraged.</p> <p><strong>Trump’s greatest geopolitical ambition is to reorient American foreign policy away from Europe and the minor rivalry with Russia, towards East Asia and the far greater rivalry with China.</strong> This pivot entails a demotion of provincial Europe in the pecking order of empire. The Americans will want Europeans to pay more for their place in the broader imperial system, and they will be inclined to extend the Europeans fewer benefits. That is what a lot of the low-resolution MAGA rhetoric about free-riding Europeans adds up to, it is the meaning of Trump’s demands that European nations massively increase NATO spending, and it has been an important subtext in the tariff negotiations too. So far, NATO member states and the EU have folded to Trump’s demands with very little resistance, despite their extravagance.</p> <p><strong>The truth is that we could fund our own defence for less than 5% of our collective GDP, but this is as yet unthinkable, because European independence would spell the end of our present system. </strong>Basically, there can be no united Europe without the Americans. If and when the Americans leave, some European nations will pursue closer trade relations with Russia; others will oppose them in this. It has been four generations since any major European nation plotted an independent geopolitical agenda; the very idea is a nightmare for our rulers, and many of the resulting alliances would remind people of unfortunate early 20th-century geopolitical configurations. This is primarily why European leaders have developed such a fanatical obsession with the war in Ukraine. For the moment, the conflict defines Russia as an external threat and suppresses all discussions about the different national interests of EU member states. It is yet another way for Germany’s political class to practice their conventional self-effacement in favour of notional pan-European interests.</p> <p>As in many other cases, <strong>Trump’s policies with respect to Europe represent the culmination of forces and trends that are much bigger than his presidency.</strong> The era of unchallenged American global hegemony is over with, and in this environment being a province of the American empire will just become a steadily worse deal for Europe as a whole.</p> <p><em>Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ZeroHedge.</em></p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T14:30:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 10:30</span>",
