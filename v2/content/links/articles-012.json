    "fullContent": "Politics Without Shame: Gerrymandering Makes Hypocrisy A Political Punch Line Authored by Jonathan Turley, Former diplomat and Democratic senator Adlai Stevenson once remarked that “a hypocrite is the kind of politician who would cut down a redwood tree, then mount the stump and make a speech for conservation.” If so, this week in politics was nothing but the worst form of stump speeches. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) declared that the move by Texas Republicans to redistrict mid-decade was a “legal insurrection of our U.S. Capitol.” In Texas, Democratic State Rep. Jolanda Jones (D) must have felt “insurrection” did not quite capture the infamy. Instead, she insisted, “I will liken this to the Holocaust.” Others repeated the Democratic mantra that it was the death of democracy. That includes former President Barack Obama, who had said nothing when Democrats made his own state the most gerrymandered in the union. In Illinois, surrounded by Texas legislators who had fled their state to prevent a legislative quorum, Gov. JB Pritzker (D) bellowed that gerrymandering was an attempt to “steal” congressional seats and to “disenfranchise people.” It did not matter that the stump Pritzker and Texas Democrats were standing on in Chicago is located in the most gerrymandered state in the country. The redistricting law, signed by Pritzker left Republicans with just three of the state’s 17 congressional seats, even though they won nearly half the votes in the last election. What is missing in any of this is any sense of shame. The most telling moment came when Pritzker went on the Stephen Colbert’s show on CBS — a show that offered him a reliably supportive audience and a long track record of 86 percent of jokes slamming conservatives or Republicans. Pritzker received roaring cheers when he said that he was protecting democracy from Texas gerrymandering. Colbert then showed him the map of Illinois, which features ridiculously shaped, snaking districts that stretch across the state — all drawn to maximize Democratic performance in elections. Pritzker just shrugged and joked how they had kindergarteners design it. Colbert and the audience laughed uproariously. So let’s recap. Pritzker had just declared gerrymandering a threat to democracy. He followed up by making a joke of his own unparalleled gerrymandering. The New York audience cheered both statements. Some of the outrage by Democrats seemed part of a comedy routine. In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey pledged to retaliate by gerrymandering her heavily gerrymandered state. The problem? It is already so badly gerrymandered that there are no Republican House members in the state — there haven’t been any since the 1990s. We have reached the point in our age of rage where one’s hypocrisy can be openly acknowledged but then dismissed with a chuckle. It is not cheap to lock Republicans out completely in heavily Democratic states. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) quickly pledged to order a new round of gerrymandering in a state where Republicans constituted roughly 40 percent of the congressional vote in 2024 but received only about 17 percent of the House seats. To reduce the Republicans to near zero would require passage of a ballot proposition, costing more than $200 million, even as California faces a budget crisis and a deficit greater than $20 billion. And that may prove to be just a fraction of the true cost. In response to the gerrymandering, Democratic strategist James Carville seemed to call for what Texas State House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu (who fled to Illinois) described as “launching nukes at each other.” Carville insisted that once the Democrats retake power, they should “unilaterally add Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia as states” and pack the Supreme Court to guarantee that the Republicans can never win again. He is not the first Democrat to openly advocate such a plan. In an October 2020 interview, Harvard law professor Michael Klarman explained how Democrats needed to use their power to enact “democracy-entrenching legislation,” which would ensure that “the Republican Party will never win another election.” Perhaps you can appreciate the unintended humor there. But Professor Klarman noted that Democrats would still have to gain control of the Supreme Court to make such legislation stick. What is striking about the Carville interview is that he was describing rigging both the legislative and judicial branches, all in the name of democracy. Carville admitted that “in isolation,” each of these ideas may be objectionable and open “Pandora’s box.” However, when done together, they somehow become acceptable. It is akin to saying that burning a home is arson, but torching a city is urban renewal. Nevertheless, Carville declared: “If you want to save democracy, I think you got to do all of those things because we just are moving further and further away from being anything close to democracy.” Again, no one listening to such unhinged ranting would fail to see the hypocrisy. What is chilling is that no one really cares. You can stack the Supreme Court and the Congress. You can gerrymander legislative and congressional maps. You can even engage in ballot cleansing by barring Republican and third-party candidates from elections. You can do all of that and still claim to be righteously defending democracy. You can even commit the most venal acts as a form of virtue signaling … even though there is not a scintilla of virtue in what you are saying. There may be one benefit to Carville and his counterparts in opening up Pandora’s Box. In the story, Pandora released an array of evils on the world, including sorrow, disease, vice, violence, greed, madness, old age, and death. However, few recall the last thing to escape the jar and perhaps the thing that the vengeful Zeus least wanted humanity to have: hope. It is possible that citizens will finally get fed up listening to these self-righteous hypocrites and join together to end gerrymandering once and for all. Rather than yield to our rage, reason could still prevail in this country in barring or at least limiting partisan redistricting. When we do that, these clear-cutting politicians will not have a stump to stand on.

    "fullContent": "Vance Says US 'Done Funding Ukraine War' - Demands Europe Step Up Vice President JD Vance stated on Sunday that Washington will no longer directly fund the purchase of weapons for Ukraine amid the seeminglyl never-ending war with Russia, and expressed hope that Europe would step up. \"We’re done with the funding of the Ukraine war business. We want to bring about a peaceful settlement to this thing,\" Vance told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\". \"Americans, I think, are sick of continuing to send their money, their tax dollars of this particular conflict but if the Europeans want to step up and actually buy the weapons from American producers we’re OK with that, but we’re not going to fund it ourselves anymore,\" the vice president continued. So while this seems a step in the right direction of finding peace settlement, his comments still signify a White House greenlight of sorts to keep the proxy war going. Already this more 'indirect' system of supplying Kiev has been in effect for some time - which sees European nations purchase and transfer American miltary hardware for Ukraine. And so it's not exactly a full commitment to turn the US arms pipeline off, and in some ways it could lead to less restrictions on the type of advanced hardware given to Ukraine. Dozens of F-16s have already been transfered to Ukraine's air force in this way. Vance in the Fox appearance commented on the open question of whether Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky will also be present at the venue for the Trump-Putin summit. While admitting that it wouldn't be a good idea for Putin and Zelensky to meet directly at this early phase, Vance held out hope that this could soon be arranged based on progress made. \"One of the most important logjams is that Vladimir Putin said that he would never sit down with Zelensky, the head of Ukraine, and the president has now got that to change,\" he said. The vice president added that White House is working on \"scheduling and things like that around when these three leaders could sit down and discuss an end to this conflict.\" Zelensky is still making his voice known amid concerns that Ukraine's interests could be sidelined. \"Ukraine is ready for real decisions that can bring peace. Any decisions that are against us, any decisions that are without Ukraine, are at the same time decisions against peace,\" he asserted in a video posted on X. European leaders are also warning that any potential deal Trump reaches \"must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.\" They are also making clear that Russia can't be allowed to just change borders by force, and so territorial consessions must not be on the table without Ukraine's consent. Meanwhile, Zelensky is still taking measures to keep spending big on defense of the nation - anticipating more funding from Western partners to come. And elsewhere in Europe... If Trump 🇺🇸 wants to hand Alaska or parts of it back to 🇷🇺 I guess he can do that. But he has no right whatsoever to trade away the territory of any other nation. None. https://t.co/ZBoo0DiXeO — Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) August 11, 2025 Zelensky announced the following a meeting of his staff on Telegram Monday, according to Ukrinform: \"I gave instructions to significantly increase funding for combat units and to do so in a way that is fair, so that brigades truly get greater capabilities. The updated rules are as follows: 7 million hryvnias per brigade for each battalion engaged in combat operations, which means that funding will increase by tens of millions of hryvnias.\" Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 13:00",
