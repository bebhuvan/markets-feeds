    "fullContent": "Next Round In The Northvolt Drama: EU Subsidy Trap And A New Californian Rescue Submitted by Thomas Kolbe After Northvolt’s spectacular collapse, a Californian start-up is now poised to buy the Swedish battery manufacturer. Brussels is already dangling new subsidies. No lessons appear to have been learned. Lyten is the new ace up the sleeve of the Brussels eco-central planners. The California-based battery manufacturer, founded in 2015, is supposed to clean up the mess left behind by former Economy Minister Robert Habeck in perfect coordination with the EU Commission and the state of Schleswig-Holstein after Northvolt’s failure. Just before Habeck left his ministerial post for Denmark (he will, of course, continue to hold his Bundestag seat), taxpayers were presented with the bill for the green subsidy debacle: roughly €900 million, of which the federal government covers €600 million of the loss via the KfW (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau), while Schleswig-Holstein had issued a €300 million guarantee. In the end, Northvolt collapsed under €5.8 billion in debt—an unsurprising result when subsidy-dependent companies operate completely detached from market demand. Enter Lyten Now, the California company Lyten is supposed to fix it. Investors include, among others, Stellantis, the parent company of Opel, and the logistics firm FedEx. The U.S. government is also listed with an investment of about $4 million. The Californians plan to acquire all remaining Northvolt sites, including the main factory in Skellefteå (Sweden), the expansion plant, the research center in Västerås, and the “Northvolt Three” project in Heide, Schleswig-Holstein. The acquisition still requires approval from the relevant regulatory authorities in Sweden, Germany, and at the EU level. The deal is expected to close in Q4 2025. Lyten plans to resume operations at the acquired sites quickly and expand them gradually. Lyten CEO Dan Cook stated that the company aims to supply the North American and European battery markets with cleanly produced energy storage systems, thereby contributing to energy and supply security. These are ambitious goals—especially as green subsidy companies are failing across Europe at an alarming pace. One must therefore ask whether the Americans realize at what stage the EU’s green transformation currently stands. Even before Northvolt’s collapse, numerous similar subsidy projects had failed, including Britishvolt, AMTE Power (also in the UK), and Freyr in Norway. These cases show that there is neither a market for this technology in Europe nor any way to artificially create one with subsidies. Cook cannot have missed the fact that the EU has thoroughly trapped itself with its Green Deal and is running a subsidy “perpetuum mobile,” passing the costs squarely onto taxpayers. A Sinister Suspicion Moreover, Lyten plans to produce lithium-sulfur batteries—a technology Northvolt never had. When these facts are combined, a dark suspicion emerges: Are the Americans merely trying to gain access to Northvolt’s intellectual property cheaply? Is this yet another case of subsidy hunters, aware worldwide that European money flows freely as long as a project shows even the slightest green sheen? Indeed, as Der Spiegel reports, Cook has already approached the European Union requesting additional subsidies. He told the paper that there is no doubt the EU wants battery production on the continent. There are several programs Lyten could access through this deal, he added. Clearly, Cook referred to the EU’s seemingly endless subsidy resources, which reportedly include another €700 million for Northvolt under the “Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework” (TCTF)—officially aimed at promoting climate neutrality, but in practice mainly funneling taxpayer money into risky transformation projects. A German Northvolt subsidiary had already received a legally binding grant, which could be transferred to a new Northvolt owner. Germany’s Doors Are Wide Open The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs confirmed to Spiegel that while there is no automatic transfer, it is indeed possible “under certain conditions.” That’s the kind of German bureaucratic prose that gives any potential buyer the impression they’re not just getting machines, halls, and personnel—but a sack of taxpayer money on top. One only has to ask nicely; evaluation hardly matters, as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) had warned. In June 2023, auditors explicitly cautioned against federal involvement in Northvolt, pointing to the lack of market potential. At Northvolt’s Stockholm headquarters, staff are more cautious. The new owner does not want Sweden’s help for the time being, said Cook to Dagens Industri. What he meant exactly is unclear—was it the migration chaos in Scandinavia, the economic downturn, or Northvolt’s collapse specifically? Ultimately, it hardly matters. Germany, in Cook’s eyes, has apparently not suffered enough yet; here, one can ask for taxpayer money without scruples. In the best Germany of all time, anyone can hope for subsidies or other forms of state support, as long as they ask politely. * * * About the author: Thomas Kolbe, a German graduate economist, has worked for over 25 years, he has worked as a journalist and media producer for clients from various industries and business associations.

As the Gaza war resumed, so did Houthi acts of aggression. \"A missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by the\" air force, Israel's army said on Telegram, and there have been no reports of casualties. According to Times of Israel citing military officials, Houthi drones also targeted the south connected with the same new attack wave: In a statement Tuesday, the Iran-backed group claimed to have launched six drones at Israel, targeting “vital targets” in Haifa, the Negev Desert, Eilat and Beersheba. “The operations successfully achieved their objectives, thanks to Allah,” the Houthis claimed. The IDF reported shooting down one drone off the coast of Eilat, which did not set off sirens in Israel’s southernmost city because it posed no threat. The other five drones likely fell short before reaching the country’s borders, as many Houthi projectiles have previously. The first inbound missiles had been detected shortly after 4am local time, setting off air sirens in various parts of Israel. Some local reports say that residents of central Israel on Thursday discovered fragments of an interceptor on or near train tracks between Ganot and Hahagana - which resulted in the railway being temporarily shut down. Israel's military launched major attacks on Yemen's Hodeidah port several weeks ago, but this and prior waves of major strikes have done little or nothing to deter Houthi resolve to inflict punishment on Israel for its military operations in Gaza, which as resulted in an immense civilian death toll. Released hostages urge Trump to end the war and secure hostage deal: \"You have the power to be the president of peace\"https://t.co/YAMSNfw15a https://t.co/HdT7LgJVJy — Haaretz.com (@haaretzcom) August 14, 2025 At this point over 60,000 Palestinians have been reported killed in the Gaza War, but the enclave's health authorities do no distinguished between armed militants and civilians in their casualty count.

    "fullContent": "British People Have Had Enough... Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, In a striking display of public discontent, close to 750,000 people at time of writing have signed an official parliamentary petition demanding an immediate general election in the UK. Titled “Call an immediate general election,” the petition argues that the public seeks urgent change from the current Labour government, which won power just over a year ago in July 2024. Under UK rules, any petition surpassing 100,000 signatures triggers consideration for a parliamentary debate, a threshold this one has far exceeded—it has also prompted a government response, with a debate now pending. https://t.co/rVGSJaMjHL — Peter Lloyd (@Suffragent_) August 13, 2025 The petition reflects mounting frustration with Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s leadership, Public dissatisfaction with Starmer stems from a range of issues, including perceived broken promises, economic struggles, and controversial welfare reforms that have sparked backlash over cuts and austerity measures. The Bank of England (BoE) has cut interest rates to 4%, the fifth cut in a year, as the UK economy struggles amid high inflation and a stagnant jobs market. The monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce the Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to… — Finance Spot (@financespotnews) August 7, 2025 The economy is stagnant with no growth and rising costs. The UK is cutting rates because the economy is falling apart not because it’s healthy. 🟥 Stagnant growth 🟥 Collapsing housing market 🟥 Business investment vanishing 🟥 Political instability — Wealth Mindset (@MWealth101) August 7, 2025 The Conservative government laid the groundwork, but the Labour government has exacerbated the woes. The Bank of England now admits that Rachel Reeves’ anti-growth budget has caused the economy to stagnate. Interest rates will stay higher for longer, with ‘heightened uncertainty’, higher prices, & higher costs. Working people foot the bill for Labour incompetence. 🥀… pic.twitter.com/dYWrljp4W3 — Anthony Boutall (@anthonyboutall) December 20, 2024 Another key flashpoint is mass migration. This week it was revealed that the UK has seen nearly 50,000 migrants cross the English Channel in small boats since Starmer became Prime Minister on July 5, 2024. 🔺 Number of small boat crossings since Starmer became Prime Minister expected to hit 50,000 on Tuesday. Read the full story ⬇️https://t.co/M0c1zbkbB2 pic.twitter.com/yY1TYJWf3v — The Telegraph (@Telegraph) August 12, 2025 This figure, reached in just 401 days, marks a significantly faster rate of crossings compared to Starmer’s predecessors, with Rishi Sunak taking 603 days and Boris Johnson 1,066 days to hit the same threshold. The numbers of crossings are up by almost 50 percent on last year. 'Just this morning we've had 220 that have arrived in Dover, with three small boats currently out in the Channel with at least 150 people heading towards the UK.' GB News' Mark White reacts to the 'sobering' migrant figures as numbers hit 50,000 so far this year. pic.twitter.com/e5EuRqBFzz — GB News (@GBNEWS) August 12, 2025 The surge has fueled criticism of Labour’s immigration policies, particularly Starmer’s pledge to “smash the gangs” behind the crossings, which critics argue has failed to deter the unprecedented influx. Opponents argue this has strained public services, housing, and infrastructure, fueling perceptions that Starmer has normalized high immigration levels without adequate controls. Another flashpoint is spiralling crime. As a backdrop to this, freedom of speech is under attack, with many who have expressed their discontent finding themselves targets. Draconian new laws, introduced on the prext of ‘protecting’ children, have immediately been used to stifle free expression. Starmer’s personal popularity has plummeted to record lows, with his net approval rating dipping to -41% in recent surveys, while Labour’s government approval has sunk to -55%, the lowest ever recorded for the party. Fresh blow to Starmer as Labour's approval rating slumps to its lowest EVER level – with just 13 per cent happy with government's record https://t.co/F7KgLTljYM — Daily Mail (@DailyMail) August 12, 2025 Only 23% of Britons view him favourably, a sharp decline from post-election highs, amid accusations of losing authority and alienating voters. Dissatisfaction has reached 61%, his highest as Labour leader, painting a picture of a prime minister fading in public esteem. Amid this turmoil, Nigel Farage’s Reform UK has exploded in popularity, often leading opinion polls and overtaking both Labour and the Conservatives in voting intentions. 🚨 NEW: Reform UK on course for a 64-seat majority — wiping out Labour and the Tories. Labour down 319 seats. Conservatives down 93. Britain’s fed up with managed decline from both old parties. The message is clear: change isn’t coming from them — it’s coming from us. pic.twitter.com/tr3G2VexL0 — Darren Grimes (@darrengrimes_) August 11, 2025 Farage now boasts higher favourability than Starmer, capitalising on anti-immigration sentiments and promises of radical change. In a desperate attempt to stave off complete annihilation, Starmer’s government recently announced it is going to lower the voting age to 16, effectively allowing children to vote. If an election were held today, recent MRP projections suggest Reform could emerge as the largest party, potentially securing the most seats in a hung parliament or even nearing a majority, while Labour and the Tories face wipeout risks. This surge underscores a seismic shift, with Reform poised to capitalise on voter anger over migration, economic woes, and establishment fatigue. As the petition gains traction, it highlights a electorate hungry for upheaval. * * * Your support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.
