    "fullContent": "There Are Three Main Themes Driving Markets By Peter Tchir of Academy Securities It’s a summer Sunday, so hopefully you aren’t spending too much time on T-Reports. If you missed last weekend’s Fixing the Data, please read. Had a lot of interesting conversations on the topic this weekend. Anything from jobs data, to more broadly, all data collection, to worries about “fabricating” data. Since Garbage In, Garbage Out has been such a long-running theme in T-Reports, it is exciting that it is near the top of everyone’s list of issues. In a completely different direction, if you are on vacation somewhere, check out our piece titled - Could The U.S. License Privateers to Combat Crypto Theft? A little more “out there” in terms of thought pieces, but something we find interesting and a great starting point for discussion. Wound up on the Wolf of All Streets (more of a crypto show than traditional finance media), but we had a great discussion around crypto treasury companies (access), stablecoins (the potential growth), and Ethereum as being the more institutionally palatable use case out there. In the meantime, we think there are three main themes driving markets. Each of which has some potential positives as well as some potential downside associated with it. Finally, outside of that construct, it is well worth thinking about what is next on the President’s to do list. He has checked off a lot of boxes already (for better or worse depending on your perspective) but there are more items on the horizon that could affect your investments. Tariffs and Trade The clear positives are: Generating revenue (for now). Whatever you (or I) think about tariffs, they have been and will continue to generate revenue for the U.S. government. We’ve sent charts on this and it is real income to the government. It remains to be seen who will ultimately pay for it (and we think it will take quarters before that becomes evident). There is some risk that existing tariffs, executed under certain emergency clauses, may be deemed invalid. Ultimately we are months away from this, as it will go to the Supreme Court, no matter what the next ruling is. There is a market (I’m told) for trading paid tariff duties. If they are overturned, even if the administration invokes different rules to implement them, there might be rebates available to those who paid. I think this is months away from any certainty, but it could hurt the deficit and may cause some countries to “slow play” deals they have apparently agreed to in principle. Deals and investment. There have been a lot of commitments to investing in the U.S. via some of the trade deals. International airlines buying U.S. planes (great but weren’t they going to anyways?). Chips (ditto). U.S. military equipment (ditto). Enforceable? Who knows. The deals are interesting, but with the exception of opening up markets to top chips from the U.S. (where sales were restricted, not by demand, but by U.S. rules), not sure how much has been truly added to the economy. The potential negatives are: If someone with the flu sneezes on you, and you don’t have flu-like symptoms within 10 minutes, it doesn’t mean that you don’t have the flu. So many victory laps on “tariffs have been absorbed” when they’ve barely hit the economy. Importers still have inventories of non-tariffed goods and haven’t begun finalizing future deals with suppliers, let alone their customers. We live in an era where so much information is available instantaneously that we sometimes forget these things take time. On balance, I think markets are a bit complacent on the risks of tariffs to consumption and corporate profits (I am less worried about inflation, but that is because I’m more worried about the overall economy). AI and Big Data The positives are obvious: The capital spending on data, AI, etc., has been driving corporate spending. We live in a world where the more you spend, the more your value increases (a bit of hyperbole, but not too far off base). How long can that continue? But the reality is that so many companies, faced with uncertainty, decided it was best to spend more on AI/Efficiency than anything else, as true efficiency (if achieved) will be important regardless of the direction of the economy. Stock returns have been driven by AI. Not here to argue about breadth, etc., but the Russell 2000 is up less than 1% on the year, while the Nasdaq 100 is up around 13%. I have read, but not verified, that even within the Nasdaq 100 the returns have been concentrated to a handful of stocks. The “mixed” impact: For anyone who equates energy with oil, you are just dead wrong (I’m trying to retrain my brain on this). Energy is electricity. The demand for electricity (aka energy) will drive innovation, new businesses, and huge opportunities for investors and companies. It may also lead to backlash as many individuals (consumers of a regulated product in most jurisdictions) may become concerned about how energy is allocated when you have demand from customers who might have a much higher price point (due to the revenue they are generating) than the average individual. Not at the “pitchforks” stage, but I can see some battlegrounds developing as the intense demand for electricity potentially competes with the traditional consumer. But make no mistake, the opportunities for those who can deliver the electricity efficiently is big! The downside? Jobless economy? While that take is a bit extreme, one does have to wonder what the job outlook is for many employees who will now effectively have to compete with AI? The best and brightest (and hopefully those that write the T-Report) will be able to use the new technology to enhance their product. But how many “minions” won’t be able to do that? The weakness in the job market amongst recent college graduates (and the spike in law school applications) is worrisome for our economy. Our society has been built on these “entry level” jobs creating the opportunity to rise up the corporate ladder. Does that disappear, shrink dramatically, or just change who makes money?. We don’t know, but something to keep an eye on. The energy play seems obvious, but a little less clear is what is left for the companies directly benefiting. There is also a lot to be seen on the job front and whether the technology is truly cost effective. The cost is rising, and it is unclear what level of “decisions” will be trusted to machines. ProSec National Production for National Security is quite a mouthful. “Drill Baby Drill” is catchy, but too limited to oil. “Refine baby Refine” was an attempt to point out that it is the refined/processed versions of rare earths and critical minerals that are in short supply and dominated by China. This administration still seems too focused (in my opinion) on access to the rare earths and critical minerals, and is not spending enough time on ensuring that the U.S. can refine and process them. We can find sellers of the commodities, but it is the next step that is crucial and we need to do more – though we’ve seen some progress on that. “National Production for National Security” tried to take this a step further. It is Chips. Pharma. Healthcare. Basically, any number of things that a country needs to produce (at some base level) to ensure their security. ProSec tries to refine this further. Production for Security is so much simpler than National Production for National Security. It isn’t up there with BRICs or Mag 7, but it is getting closer? Security goes well beyond national security. Job/Income security. If you know your country is supporting your job in a way that it didn’t previously, you have a lot more “security.” You don’t fret after every meal about what “bad things” might happen. It lets you dream. It lets you invest in the future. While I’m not saying “National Security” doesn’t matter, I am saying that it is easy to underestimate the sense of peace people can have knowing their careers are safe and they can plan for the future. While it wasn’t incorrect to focus on National Security, it was too restrictive. Security comes in many shapes and forms, all of which are important to the economy and the health of a country. I always live in constant fear of this being the “last T-Report”, and AI has done little to help that, but if we can bring a lot of industry (and national importance) back to the U.S., it will help the “vibe” of the country. More on this in future reports. Deregulation. That’s it. That’s the entire section. Deregulation. Deregulation. Deregulation. It is something the President excels at and something we need, especially if ProSec is going to reach its full potential. The Presidential “To Do” List My understanding, from those who have worked with Trump before and those that “know” the current administration, is that he is well aware of the promises he made, and the expectation that he delivers. There are a few things currently out there that may impact markets. Russia/Ukraine Truce. This is out there and something we cover in SITREPs, but it does seem that it is impacting energy prices (secondary sanctions) and also potentially straining relations with Europe again (potentially giving Russia too much land, etc.). Again, we will dive deeper into this in a future SITREP as the President prepares to meet with Putin. Somewhat related, but off the radar, is the risk that the President goes after Brazil’s purchase of Russian Diesel. For those of us stuck with Energy = Oil, that is too simplistic. We’ve already started trying to condition ourselves to see Energy = Electricity, but we’ve also been trying to point out that oil is somewhat useless. Gasoline and Diesel are very useful. Currently Brazil is buying a lot of Russian Diesel and given the 50% tariffs linked (potentially questionably) to Bolsonaro, we could see other tariffs imposed on their purchases of diesel. That could upset markets more than sanctions on oil. Marijuana Rescheduling. We’ve seen stocks in this sector bounce recently (MSOS as an example of an ETF linked to the sector), but I am not getting a sense that this is a high priority. The current scheduling seems so arbitrary, that it could be shifted, and likely will be, but when you compare this admin’s focus on crypto to marijuana, one clearly resonates and the other seems to be a “sidebar” at best. Cruise ships. There was fear that the “Big Beautiful Bill” would target registrations (and tax implications) for the cruise industry. It didn’t happen, but this is the exact sort of thing that could resonate with the President now that he has “ticked the box” on so many other issues. If there is any President who would “love” to see big beautiful American flags flying from every cruise ship and generating as much tax revenue as possible from the industry, it would seem to be this President. Watch out for some headlines on this front. Bottom Line A few competing narratives, all of which have some upside potential, with downside risk. Tariffs have seen too much good and not enough bad priced in, but it is at the margin and will take time to show up in the data. Rent declines and a slowing economy mean that tariffs are more likely to hit corporate profits than create inflation. The direct AI beneficiaries have benefited so much that each incremental dollar of upside is more difficult to achieve. The demand for electricity, already somewhat priced in, seems to have more upside. The risk to jobs and a slowdown in the economy (losing what used to be “entry level” or even “mid-level” corporate jobs), resulting from advancements in AI will take a toll on employment and spending, and not enough fear of that is out there. ProSec is my focus on the long side of risk assets. And even on the job front, while AI may displace certain jobs, ProSec may not only create new jobs, but it will also create jobs with a higher degree of “security” (certainty), which is a benefit in and of itself. Don’t forget the To Do list. While many big issues have been addressed/tackled, there are a lot of other issues that the admin will likely focus on in the coming months, and getting those right at the margin will influence returns. This was not AI generated, but hopefully still useful. Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 16:20",

    "fullContent": "Japanese Automakers Losing $20 Million Per Day To U.S. Tariffs Japanese automakers are losing an estimated 3 billion yen ($20.3 million) in combined profits every day the U.S. delays lowering auto tariffs, according to company data, according to Nikkei Asia. The full-year hit from the duties is projected at 2.7 trillion yen ($18.3 billion), dragging aggregate operating profit down 36% for six major producers, excluding Nissan, which has not given a forecast. The U.S. raised tariffs on Japanese vehicles to 27.5% from 2.5% in April but agreed last month to cut the rate to 15%. Goldman Sachs Japan estimates the reduction will lessen the damage by 1.6 trillion yen, but each month of delay adds roughly 100 billion yen to automakers’ burden, Nikkei reports. Mazda, which gets about one-third of its sales from the U.S., expected an 82% drop in net profit to 20 billion yen this fiscal year, assuming the lower rate would start Aug. 1. With tariffs estimated to cost 233.3 billion yen, it aims to offset the blow with 80 billion yen in cost cuts, but further delays could push it into the red. Subaru, with 70% of its sales in the U.S., forecasts a 210 billion yen hit and a 51% drop in operating profit to 200 billion yen. Nikkei Asia writes that Toyota projects the biggest loss—1.4 trillion yen—due to high U.S. sales and supplier costs. Its forecast also assumed an Aug. 1 start date. In July, Toyota raised U.S. prices by an average $270, citing “the improved performance of the vehicles rather than the tariffs.” Takanori Azuma, chief officer of Toyota’s accounting group, said there could be further hikes “if there is an appropriate time when customers can accept them.” Toyota now expects pricing changes to lift earnings by 370 billion yen, up from 250 billion, but far below the tariff impact. Price hikes carry risks. A rush of pre-hike buying may slow sales later, and higher prices could weaken competitiveness. “We continue to consider [price hikes] cautiously,” Honda CFO Eiji Fujimura said. Mitsubishi Motors, which raised prices in June, still posted a 3 billion yen operating loss in North America last quarter, with a 14.4 billion yen tariff drag. If prices can’t fully offset the duties, automakers must cut costs. Toyota expects savings, higher sales volume, and a better model mix to add 899.5 billion yen to operating profit. Japan’s lead trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said he expects the U.S. to lower the tariff rate when Washington corrects its “reciprocal” tariff order. Asked when, he said the two sides “tacitly share an understanding that it'd be best to do it quickly.” Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 15:45",

    "fullContent": "California Moves Forward With Special Redistricting Election To Counter Texas's Plan Authored by Aldgra Fredly via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Friday that the state will move forward with a ballot measure in November to redraw its congressional map in response to a Republican-backed redistricting plan in Texas. Accompanied by California and Texas lawmakers, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (C) discusses the push to schedule a special election to redraw California's Congressional voting districts, during a news conference in Sacramento, Calif., on Aug. 8, 2025. Rich Pedroncelli/AP Photo Speaking alongside state Democratic leaders, Newsom said they would call for a special election in the first week of November to vote on redrawing the congressional map, a move that could potentially add five more U.S. House seats to the Democratic tally. “We are talking about emergency measures to respond to what’s happening in Texas, and we will nullify what happens in Texas,” the Democratic governor told reporters. “We will pick up five seats with the consent of the people, and that’s the difference between the approach we’re taking and the approach they’re taking. We’re doing it [on a] temporary basis,” he added. Newsom also reaffirmed that the state will remain committed to its independent redistricting process. The Democrats said they expected to have a newly agreed-upon map, based on previous plans reviewed by the state’s independent redistricting commission, ready for public scrutiny next week, three months before it would go to voters. Former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who attended the conference, backed Newsom’s decision and praised Texas Democratic lawmakers for their efforts to block the GOP’s redistricting plan. “It’s not wrong in what we’re doing. This is self-defense for our democracy,” Pelosi said. “I thank again our Texans for their leadership, for their courage, and most of all, for their patriotism.” Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) speaks in support of the Texas Democratic lawmakers for their walkout to block a vote on a congressional redistricting plan sought by President Donald Trump, during a news conference in Sacramento, Calif., on Aug. 8, 2025. Rich Pedroncelli/AP Photo The move came as Texas Republicans drew a new congressional map aimed at flipping five Democratic seats in the November 2026 midterm election, prompting more than 50 Texas Democratic lawmakers to leave the state and break quorum in a bid to block the map from moving forward. Abbott added redrawing the congressional map onto the special session agenda after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sent the Texas governor a letter on July 7 raising concerns that four congressional districts in the Houston and Dallas areas were unconstitutional because of “racial gerrymandering.” Current boundaries run afoul of the Voting Rights Act by relying on racial demographics to group minority voters into “coalition districts,” where no single racial group forms a majority, according to the DOJ. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) stated on X that Democratic lawmakers still refused to appear for the Aug. 8 quorum deadline. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit with the Texas Supreme Court later that day seeking a declaration that the seats of 13 absent Democratic lawmakers were unlawfully vacant. Paxton said Texas law gives him the authority to represent the state in “quo warranto actions” and to appear before the Texas Supreme Court in matters of direct state interest. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the Texas Department of Public Safety, along with the FBI, is tracking down Democratic lawmakers who left the state, and they will be brought to the Texas Capitol. “Those who received benefits for skipping a vote face removal from office and potential bribery charges. In Texas, there are consequences for your actions,” he stated on X. Abbott also filed a lawsuit on Aug. 5 seeking the removal of state Rep. Gene Wu, who chairs the Texas House Democratic Caucus, accusing him of leading the lawmakers to break quorum and abandoning office. Wu has said that he intends to fight for his constituents. Texas Rep. Gene Wu speaks in front of Democratic members of Congress and Texas House Democrats during a news conference, after they left their state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to redraw the state's 38 congressional districts, at IBEW Local Union 701 in Warrenville, Ill., on Aug. 4, 2025. Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images In response to Newsom’s earlier comments saying he intends to temporarily bypass California’s independent redistricting commission and hold a special election in November, U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) on Aug. 5 proposed to ban mid-decade redistricting at the federal level, accusing the governor of “tricking voters to abolish the Redistricting Commission.” “Gerrymandering is a problem regardless of which party does it, and it certainly shouldn’t be done in the middle of the decade,” Kiley posted on X Aug. 6. “But what Gavin Newsom is attempting in California goes beyond that.” Kiley’s legislation, if passed, would also put the brakes on Texas Republicans’ plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts. In response to the bill, Newsom said that he supports the state’s independent redistricting commission and that any redistricting actions in California would be contingent on Texas’s decisions. “I’m appreciative that this member of Congress is waking up to the realities, what has occurred in Texas,” Newsom said during a press conference Aug. 5. “I haven’t heard much from him as it relates to the condemnation of their efforts, but I’m grateful that he recognizes the importance of a national framework.” Darlene McCormick Sanchez, Jill McLaughlin, and Reuters contributed to this report.

    "fullContent": "White House Mulls Inviting Zelensky To Trump-Putin Talks In Alaska The White House is weighing the possibility of inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Alaska for Friday's summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, several sources in the Trump administration have told media oulets. \"It’s under discussion,\" a person briefed on the matter told NBC. This despite Puting having repeatedly said it would be too early for him to meet with the Ukrainain leader, and that he'd only do so to sign a final peace settlement to end the war. Russian Orthodox Church on Alaskan coast, file image The Kremlin has made clear that the warring sides are nowhere near that point, and has even questioned the legla legitimacy of Zelensky's tenure in office far past the canceled elections. No plans have been finalized, and it's as yet unlcear whether Zelensky will actually travel to Alaska for talks. Yet a senior US official has said idea is \"absolutely\" still on the table. \"Everyone is very hopeful it will happen,\" the official added. And yet it could cause Putin to get cold feet if he senses undue pressure in this regard. Putin is unlikley to want to be in the same room, or even the same venue as talks proceed. Zelensky made clear on Saturday that he's unwilling to make a key compromise demanded of Russia. I welcome the upcoming meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Russia’s President Putin being held here in the great state of Alaska. Alaska is the most strategic location in the world, sitting at the crossroads of North America and Asia, with the Arctic to our north and… — Governor Mike Dunleavy (@GovDunleavy) August 8, 2025 Zelensky firmly declared that Ukrainians \"will not give their land to occupiers\" and that nothing can be decided in this regard without direct representation and input from Kiev. He was very clear on this point: \"Any decisions made against us, any decisions made without Ukraine, are at the same time decisions against peace.\" He then clarified Ukriane's position further, \"They will bring nothing. These are dead decisions; they will never work.\" But Putin will settle for nothing less than Ukraine formally ceding the four eastern territories which have already been declared part of the Russian Federation after a referendum which Kiev rejected. These are Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Additionally, Ukriane has not issued clarification on whether it is at least ready to given up Crimea. Drone attacks have conintued to target Crimea, and other southern portions of Russia - especially targeting oil refineries and energy infrastructure... Ukraine imposes its own sanctions on the Russian oil industry after Trump let his Friday deadline lapse without action. https://t.co/0Ny7nFfU15 — Yaroslav Trofimov (@yarotrof) August 10, 2025 Yet Trump seems to think land will be central to negotiations - even though the Ukrainians, and Europeans for that matter, are clearly not on board. \"We will not reward Russia,\" Zelensky has also vowed, in line with many European leaders - who also want a seat at the table. \"We’re going to get some back, and we’re going to get some switched,\" Trump had said during a Friday event at the White House, as quoted in the NY Times. \"There’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both.\" But this is anything but clear, as the Alaska summit fast approaches.

    "fullContent": "The Debt And Deficit Problem Isn't What You Think Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com, In recent months, much debate has been about rising debt and increasing deficit levels in the U.S. For example, here is a recent headline from CNBC: The article’s author suggests that U.S. federal deficits are ballooning, with spending surging due to the combined impact of tax cuts, expansive stimulus, and entitlement expenditures. Of course, with institutions like Yale, Wharton, and the CBO warning that this trend has pushed interest costs to new heights, now exceeding defense outlays, concerns about domestic solvency are rising. Even prominent figures in the media, from Larry Summers to Ray Dalio, argue that drastic action is urgently needed, otherwise another “financial crisis” is imminent. The problem with Larry Summers’, Ray Dalio’s, and many others’ warnings of impending financial doom is that they have been warning of that very problem for decades. Such was the point of our previous discussion: “It doesn’t take much to understand that Ray Dalio, a hedge fund titan, is like every other human being and is prone to error. I will not dismiss Dalio entirely, as his track record of managing money at Bridgewater is nothing to be scoffed at. However, his track record is far less enviable regarding debt crisis predictions. Here is a brief timeline.” March 2015 – Hedge Funder Dalio Thinks the Fed Can Repeat 1937 All Over Again January 2016 – The 75-Year Debt Supercycle Is Coming To An End September 2018 – Ray Dalio Says The Economy Looks Like 1937 And A Downturn Is Coming In About Two Years January 2019 – Ray Dalio Sees Significant Risk Of A US Recession October 2022 – Dalio Warns Of Perfect Storm For The Economy (That was also the stock market low.) September 2023 – Dalio Says The US Is Going To Have A Debt Crisis But you can even go further back than these when he wrote about some of his biggest mistakes about a decade ago: Here is the Problem for Investors For investors who listened to Dalio’s predictions of a coming “depression” a decade ago, they missed participating in one of the most significant bull markets in U.S. history. Yet over the past 40 years, the national debt has grown exponentially, with none of the dire consequences repeatedly predicted. Interest rates have fluctuated, political gridlock has persisted, and deficits have widened, but the U.S. economy continues to function, grow, and attract global capital. The reason is that the U.S. continues to enjoy what economists call the “exorbitant privilege” of being the issuer of the world’s reserve currency. Treasuries remain the deepest, most liquid capital market globally, and the dollar is central to global trade, investment, and reserves. This creates a structural advantage that allows the U.S. to run larger deficits than other nations without facing the same level of market discipline. So long as global trust in U.S. institutions and the rule of law remains intact, there is a deep and steady demand for U.S. debt, providing a long runway before any severe funding stress emerges. Moreover, deficit spending is no longer a temporary tool used in times of crisis; it has become an embedded feature of the economy. Social Security, Medicare, defense, and other entitlements are politically sacrosanct. At the same time, fiscal transfers (like tax credits and subsidies) are now a regular part of household consumption and corporate support. In many ways, the U.S. economy is now structurally reliant on deficit-financed stimulus. Growth, consumer spending, and even corporate investment increasingly depend on a steady stream of government outlays. While U.S. debt and deficit levels are elevated, there is no imminent risk of fiscal collapse. However, it is worth examining the impact of rising debt and deficit levels on future economic prosperity. The Real Problem With Debts and Deficits I understand the concerns about rising debt levels. However, the problem of rising debt levels for the U.S. is NOT a default but a continued degradation of economic growth. Let’s start this discussion with a basic fact—without continued increases in debt, there would be very little to no economic growth. This is because all government debt winds up in the economy and the household’s balance sheet through lending, credit, or direct payments. We can view this by looking at the dollars of debt required to create a dollar of economic growth. Since 1980, the increase in debt has usurped the entire economic growth. The problem with the growth in debt is that it diverts tax dollars away from productive investments into debt service and social welfare. Another way to view this is to consider “debt-free” economic growth. In other words, without debt, there has been no organic economic growth since 2015. Thus, the debt and subsequent deficits must continue to expand to sustain economic growth. The economic deficit has never been more significant. From 1952 to 1982, the economic surplus fostered an economic growth rate averaging roughly 8%. Today, that is no longer the case as the debt detracts from growth. Such is why the Federal Reserve has found itself in a “liquidity trap” where: Interest rates MUST remain low, and debt MUST grow faster than the economy, just to keep the economy from stalling out. The problem with the current issuance of debt is that it is primarily non-productive debt. That is a crucially important concept concerning debt issuance and its impact on economic growth. Non-Productive Debt Is The Problem Not all debt is created equal. The key distinction lies between productive and non-productive debt, and understanding the difference is critical to evaluating the risks and benefits of government borrowing. Productive debt refers to borrowing used for investments that generate long-term economic returns, such as infrastructure, education, research, or business capital expenditures. These types of investments can increase future GDP, improve productivity, and ultimately pay for themselves through higher tax revenues. In contrast, non-productive debt funds consumption or transfers that do not yield a measurable economic return. In the U.S., social welfare and interest payments on existing debt are a large majority of Government expenditures. The data below shows that of every dollar spent by the Federal Government, roughly 73% is “mandatory” spending on social welfare and interest expense. While the non-productive spending is necessary, primarily to support vulnerable populations, it adds to the debt burden without expanding the economy’s capacity to grow. The U.S., like many developed economies, increasingly relies on non-productive debt to sustain economic momentum, which raises concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability. The danger isn’t the debt itself; it’s when borrowed funds fail to create future value, leaving future taxpayers with the bill and no corresponding economic benefit. Dr. Woody Brock’s book “American Gridlock” best explains the difference between productive and non-productive debt. “The word “deficit” has no real meaning. Take a look at the following example: Country A spends $4 Trillion with receipts of $3 Trillion. This leaves Country A with a $1 Trillion deficit. In order to make up the difference between the spending and the income, the Treasury must issue $1 Trillion in new debt. That new debt is used to cover the excess expenditures, but generates no income leaving a future hole that must be filled. Country B spends $4 Trillion and receives $3 Trillion income. However, the $1 Trillion of excess, which was financed by debt, was invested into projects, infrastructure, that produced a positive rate of return. There is no deficit as the rate of return on the investment funds the “deficit” over time. There is no disagreement about the need for government spending. The disagreement is with the abuse, and waste, of it.” Currently, the U.S. is Country A. Increases in the national debt have long been squandered on increases in social welfare programs and, ultimately, higher debt service, which has an effective negative return on investment. Therefore, the larger the debt balance, the more economically destructive it is by diverting increasing amounts of dollars from productive assets to debt service. But here is where the most essential concept to understand comes into play. A Negative Multiplier Excess “debt” has a zero-to-negative multiplier effect, as Economists Jones and De Rugy showed in a study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. “The multiplier looks at the return in economic output when the government spends a dollar. If the multiplier is above one, it means that government spending draws in the private sector and generates more private consumer spending, private investment, and exports to foreign countries. If the multiplier is below one, the government spending crowds out the private sector, hence reducing it all. The evidence suggests that government purchases probably reduce the size of the private sector as they increase the size of the government sector. On net, incomes grow, but privately produced incomes shrink.” Personal consumption expenditures and business investment are vital inputs into the economic equation. As such, we should not ignore the reduction of privately produced incomes. Furthermore, according to the best available evidence, the study found: “There are no realistic scenarios where the short-term benefit of stimulus is so large that the government spending pays for itself. In fact, the positive impact is small, and much smaller than economic textbooks suggest.” Politicians spend money based on political ideologies rather than sound economic policy. Therefore, the findings should not surprise you. The conclusion of the study is most telling. “If you think that the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy is reasonably competent, then you actually shouldn’t expect the fiscal boost from all that spending to be large. In fact, it could be close to zero. This is, of course, all before taking future taxes into account. When economists like Robert Barro and Charles Redlick studied the multiplier, they found once you account for future taxes required to pay for the spending, the multiplier could be negative.” What should not surprise you is that non-productive debt does not create economic growth. As Stuart Sparks of Deutsche Bank noted previously: “History teaches us that although investments in productive capacity can in principle raise potential growth and r* in such a way that the debt incurred to finance fiscal stimulus is paid down over time (r-git turns out that there is little evidence that it has ever been achieved in the past. Rising federal debt as a percentage of GDP has historically been associated with declines in estimates of r* – the need to save to service debt depresses potential growth. The broad point is that aggressive spending is necessary, but not sufficient. Spending must be designed to raise productive capacity, potential growth, and r*. Absent true investment, public spending can lower r*, passively tightening for a fixed monetary stance.” This is why the economic drag from a debt reduction would be devastating. The last time such a reversion occurred was during the Great Depression. Conclusion This is one of the primary reasons why economic growth will continue to run at lower levels. Reversing non-productive spending is impossible due to the general population’s vast dependence on those programs. Reducing that spending would be “economic suicide.” However, as noted in “Deficits May Find Their Cure In A.I.” “From the deficit narrative perspective, this all suggests that the future is potentially much brighter than most imagine. The infrastructure buildout for AI data factories can drive economic growth by creating jobs, stimulating industries, and enabling AI-driven productivity gains. As noted above, increasing growth only marginally would stabilize the current debt-to-GDP ratio. However, boosting GDP growth to 2.3%- 3% annually would vastly improve outcomes. Furthermore, if interest rates drop by just 1%, this could reduce spending by $500 billion annually, helping to ease fiscal pressures.” While the U.S. faces a daunting fiscal outlook marked by rising debt and expanding deficits, the genuine concern is not an imminent crisis or default. Instead, the deeper, more structural issue is that an increasing share of federal borrowing is funneled into programs that support consumption but fail to generate future economic returns. That shift, which began over 50 years ago, creates a long-term drag on economic growth, crowds out private investment, and lowers the economy’s potential, or r*. As the data and history show, debt to fund productive assets, like infrastructure, innovation, and education, can sustain growth and even pay for itself over time. But borrowing for entitlements and debt service does not. Unfortunately, the political and demographic realities make it nearly impossible to reverse course without severe economic fallout. Unless policymakers redirect fiscal priorities toward investment in productive capacity, the economy will remain trapped in a cycle of low growth, rising obligations, and declining returns. Innovation may offer a way out, particularly the AI-driven transformation. If leveraged wisely, with targeted investment and smart policy, AI could lift productivity, restore growth, and ease the fiscal strain. The path forward is narrow, but not closed, and not one of imminent financial crisis. However, the real challenge will be political will.

Climatologically, tropical activity tends to pick up right about now, with the season's peak typically occurring by mid-August. New on the National Hurricane Center's radar are the increasing odds for a tropical depression or storm forming in the Atlantic over the next week. The basin is historically approaching its most active period of the year. A tropical wave is located just southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands, or about 400 miles off the west coast of Africa. Conditions appear favorable for further development, and a tropical depression will likely form by the middle to end of next week as the system moves west-northwest at 15 to 20 mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.

Lithium-ion batteries are retired from their role powering EVs when they still have a lot of life left in them, and repurposing them for one of the fastest-growing energy industry sectors is a no-brainer. Diverting lithium-ion batteries away from landfill and into storage projects yields multiple overlapping benefits.

    "fullContent": "Has Anybody Noticed That US M2 Is Hitting All-Time Highs? Authored by Mark Jeftovic via DollarCollapse.com, From my monthly Bitcoin Capitalist Letter to subscribers, after a lengthy look at bond yields, and how they’ve been going the wrong direction ever since the Fed’s half-point cut last September, I remarked on the following: “The US is flooding the bond market with so much supply to fund deficit spending, that bond prices are falling.” - KobeissiLetter It’s also worth noting that the yields on the US 30-year are also running hot: Looking like they could crack 5% at some point, and the Treasury’s most recent projections on the next couple quarters of debt issuance might help tip the scales: The Treasury released their borrowing estimates. $1.6T in net new debt issuance over the next two quarters. About $500B of it is the TGA refill. pic.twitter.com/3IEBz0mKbc — Lyn Alden (@LynAldenContact) July 28, 2025 We frequently talk about the global financial system “flashing bright red warning lights” and “slowly coming unglued” – this is exactly what we mean. Weird divergences between policy rates and bond yields, bizarre mis-pricings in the market (i.e: German 30-year paper trades at the same rate as Japan’s. German interest rate: 2.25%, debt-to-GDP: 62%. Japan? 0.05% interest rate and 250% debt-to-GDP. Both 30-year bonds yield 3.1%). How can that be possible? It means the global bond markets are cracking up – and remember something else we’ve always said from the very beginning: our base case thesis for Bitcoin is that it’ll have multi-decade long tailwinds in the form of a secular bond exodus. How many are aware that US M2 just hit fresh all-time highs, nudging past COVID levels after a brief (not to mention aberrant) period of tightening? The US government is now adding an extra trillion dollars in debt every 100 days. As I went on to remark in the letter: You don’t hear any of this being scrutinized on CNBC or in the Financial Times because it’s just too big to think about, let alone rectify. The M2 high was posted in the June dataset and there’s been no real acknowledgements of it. It was remarked upon at the time by Rob & Sam Kovacs via Seeking Alpha and Coindesk ran a piece about a week later, which did trickle out via Yahoo Finance. That’s about it. The “conventional wisdom” around Bitcoin (and for readers of DollarCollapse, who are perhaps more interested in gold) was that these assets required low interest rates and rising money supply to make “number go up”, but the first two years of this cycle saw BTC go practically straight up, against a blistering rate hiking cycle and declining M2. (When it comes to gold, I also like to point out to those who say it requires lower rates, that the entire second leg of the 1970’s gold super-spike occurred against a backdrop of rising real rates). What happens now that rates really have one direction to go (yields be damned, more inflation) and M2 is back on track to infinity? Gold and Bitcoin have been taking turns notching up all-time highs for about the last year, and now M2 is joining the race. After I put out this month’s issue, the Aug 6th US 10-year auction “tailed”, with the lowest bid-to-cover in a year. This is telling us that US debt, ostensibly the global financial systems “risk free” asset. is increasingly being seen as more risky (“return free risk”, as Lacy Hunt once dubbed bonds). It’s almost as if the illustration I put into my Crypto Capitalist Manifesto back in 2021 is playing out exactly as I foretold: hard assets like gold and Bitcoin were going to experience multi-decade tailwinds from a global bond exodus: The signals are clear: gold, silver (which is breaking out) – and Bitcoin are all experiencing capital inflows – meanwhile bonds are dead money walking. The next Fed M2 supply update comes on August 26th – does anybody think it’ll come in lower? * * * The Crypto Capitalist Manifesto (my original investment thesis) is available on Amazon, you can also get a free copy here » Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 12:50",

USSOCOM wrote in a Statement of Objectives document that the 33 \"vehicle targets\" must have all fluids and batteries from every vehicle removed, including the Cybertruck's 1,600-pound battery. USSOCOM units will use the \"manufactured vehicles for target vehicle training flight test events,\" according to a Controlled Unclassified Information document from the military. The document continued, \"In the operating theatre it is likely the type of vehicles used by the enemy may transition to Tesla Cyber trucks as they have been found not to receive the normal extent of damage expected upon major impact. Testing needs to mirror real world situations. The intent of the training is to prep the units for operations by simulating scenarios as closely as possible to the real world situations.\" The U.S. Military admitted that the Cybertruck is the most advanced truck on the market. USSOCOM units are expected to use precision-guided munitions such as AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and GBU-69/B Small Glide Munitions against the Cybertrucks aimed to simulate realistic combat scenarios. We also suspect the GM-114R9X Hellfire and various forms of kamikaze drones could also be used in the testing. Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 12:15",

    "fullContent": "DOJ Launches Grand Jury Investigation into Letitia James' Prosecution Of Trump Authored by Debra Heine via American Greatness, The Department of Justice has launched two new investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James and her office over her allegedly malicious targeting of political enemies. The U.S. attorney in Albany, Daniel Hanlon, issued two subpoenas to James, the first one related to her office’s civil fraud case against President Trump, the New York Times reported. The Justice Department reportedly believes her prosecution of Trump violated his Constitutional rights. The second subpoena is related to her office’s long-running effort to dissolve the National Rifle Association (NRA), according to the Times. Attorney General Pam Bondi has signed off on the probes, and a there is a grand jury underway in New York’s state capital Albany, Fox News reported Friday. “The DOJ Is going after James because she took then former president Donald Trump to court ‘simply because she didn’t like him and campaigned on getting him,'” Fox reported. The Justice Department reportedly believes James violated Trump’s First Amendment rights dealing with free speech. James had accused Trump of inflating his net worth to get a good deal on loans and other financial benefits. Trump-hating Judge Engoron ruled in her favor and ordered the Trump Organization to pay a $454 million bond, prompting George Washington University law Professor Jonathan Turley to call it “absurdly out of line with not just the purpose of the law but the facts of the case.” A New York Appeals Court later reduced Trump’s bond to $175 million, which he paid on March 31, 2024. Trump fumed against Engoron and James on Truth Social after he paid the bond. “He is a whacked out nut job who just made up a number out of thin air, just like he did on the value of Mar-a-Lago,” Trump said. “Businesses won’t enter New York because of this decision, and many are fleeing. Think of it – I had to pay an enormous sum for the right to Appeal the ridiculous decision of a CROOKED Judge and A.G. This is Election Interference, and it all comes directly from Joe Biden and the White House. An attack, along with ALL OF THE OTHERS, on his political opponent, ME!” After the 2024 election, James refused to drop the case, reasoning that presidents are not protected by immunity in civil cases. Trump-connected GOP lawyer Mike Davis warned James back in November that if she continued her lawfare against Trump, “we will put your fat ass in prison.” Davis made the stunning remarks during an appearance on conservative commentator Benny Johnson’s “Benny Show.” “Let me just say this to big Tish James, the New York Attorney General,” Davis began. “I dare you—I dare you to try to continue the lawfare against President Trump in his second term because, listen here sweetheart, we’re not messing around this time and we will put your fat ass in prison for conspiracy against rights. I promise you that.” “Think long and hard before you want to violate President Trump’s constitutional rights or any other American’s constitutional rights, sweetie. It’s not going to happen again, ” Davis added. As of August 8, 2025, the civil case remained on appeal. In March, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard formally revoked security clearances for James and dozens of other Democrat officials who weaponized the government to help Joe Biden or punish the regime’s political enemies. In May, the Department of Justice launched a formal criminal investigation into James over mortgage fraud allegations involving her properties in Norfolk, Virginia and Brooklyn, New York. AG Bondi has reportedly appointed Associate Deputy Attorney General Ed Martin as Special prosecutor to investigate that case, as well as similar allegations against Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). A grand jury in Virginia will investigate the mortgage fraud claims against James, and a grand jury in Maryland will investigate the allegations against Schiff, Fox News reported. And now, the Justice Department has launched a separate investigation into James over her political targeting of Trump. James’s personal lawyer, Abbe Lowell, called the latest investigation “the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president’s political retribution campaign.” “Weaponizing the Department of Justice to try to punish an elected official for doing her job is an attack on the rule of law and a dangerous escalation by this administration,” he said. “If prosecutors carry out this improper tactic and are genuinely interested in the truth, we are ready and waiting with facts and the law.” Geoff Burgan, a spokesman for James, said: “We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers’ rights.” Professor Turley, meanwhile, opined on X that he was “skeptical that such a prosecution could be sustained absent bombshell evidence uncovered by the grand jury.” He added: “While the court was dead wrong, James prevailed in the case and that would be weighed in the balance.” According to Fox News, the new allegations “stem from a resent strike force set up inside the Justice Department to investigate the alleged plot to tie Trump to Russia in 2016.” That strike force has reportedly “expanded to other topics.” Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 11:40",

    "fullContent": "Africa Set To Test Critical-Minerals-Backed Currency Authored by Darren Taylor via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Major countries and regional blocs in Africa are throwing their weight behind an ambitious plan to establish a “non-circulating” currency backed by critical minerals, which are crucial to technological development, defense, and economic growth. A miner displays diamonds dug out of a disused mine in Komaggas, South Africa, in June 2012. Alexander Joe/AFP/Getty Images Analysts say a denomination based on commodities could reduce Africa’s reliance on foreign currencies—especially the U.S. dollar—and decrease its dependence on loans from China, Europe, the United States, and global financial institutions like the World Bank. The proposed monetary unit is provisionally called the African Units of Account (AUA), according to a plan formulated by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and KPMG South Africa. The new currency is supported by the African Union and South Africa, the continent’s biggest economic power, and could soon be piloted in a test market. The proposal says the AUA would be traded on the international foreign exchange market, and would be less susceptible to fluctuations in individual African currencies or the U.S. dollar, making it more attractive to investors. Economists say the backing of the currency with mineral reserves could reduce the risk perceived by lenders, potentially leading to lower interest rates on loans for development projects, especially in Africa’s energy sector. While some in Africa’s mining industry are optimistic about the potential of such a currency, others warn that China could “weaponize” it, given Beijing’s dominance in global critical minerals supply chains. The International Energy Agency and other organizations project that demand for critical minerals like cobalt, copper, platinum, and lithium will spike fourfold shortly, with global powers in a race to secure supplies. Africa is at the center of the competition. It’s the world’s poorest and least developed region, but it holds almost a third of global reserves of critical minerals, according to the International Monetary Fund. The minerals are essential for modern technologies like smartphones and computers, in electricity grids, and in weapons such as missile systems, fighter jets, and warships. U.S. President Donald Trump regards critical minerals as vital to the future of the United States, and he wants to secure supply chains as soon as possible. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) lists 50 minerals essential to America’s economy and national security, including cobalt, lithium, manganese, platinum, tantalum, tungsten, and vanadium. Most are found in Africa. South Africa, for example, is the world’s largest producer of manganese and platinum; Zimbabwe is one of the world’s top lithium producers, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) mines approximately 70 percent of the world’s cobalt. “A well-managed and structured critical minerals currency could strengthen Africa’s hand in global resources markets and free it to leverage its abundant natural resources,” said Moeletsi Mbeki, a South African economist. This, he told The Epoch Times, is especially important at a time when the continent seeks to mitigate economic damage from global uncertainty caused by conflicts and “market turmoil.” “If we consider the tariffs that Trump’s slapping around, and global trade wars happening now and in the future, maybe this new currency could prevent Africa from being collateral damage,” said Mbeki. The AfDB and KPMG proposal said the currency would be backed by a basket of some of Africa’s most important critical minerals, and would be part of an initiative to create “a more unified and stable financial system.” The framework document suggested that key producers of critical minerals pledge a pre-agreed proportion of proven commodity reserves to “promote regional financial integration, co-operation and cross-border trade.” Moono Mupotola, AfDB director in Southern Africa, told The Epoch Times the bank is deciding on the minerals to be included in a “test” and is set to select a “pilot country” where a study of the feasibility of the new currency will happen. Mbeki said the currency could help Africa take ownership of its critical minerals and their processing. “We have all these minerals, but we don’t benefit much from them, because Africa’s value chain is so weak,” he explained. “We process less than five percent of minerals domestically, which means the real profits are earned by foreigners, especially China. “If we can use a common currency to unite Africa’s mining industries and their governments, it’s a real step towards more independence and greater local beneficiation and profits going into African pockets.” Professor Hambaba Jimaima, international relations researcher at the University of Zambia, said Africa’s steps toward the currency are an indication that it wants as much economic independence as possible from both China and the West, as it prepares to be a prominent player in world affairs. “Africa’s tired of being beholden to the West for aid and trade and to China for investment and loans,” he told The Epoch Times. “It wants to use critical minerals and a currency connected to them as a basis for industrialization and greater political clout. “Africa has given away control of critical minerals to China. Africa wants this control back. It wants to mine and refine its own resources. Critical minerals are Africa’s trump card. The currency must be seen in this light.” But other experts, like Ugandan economist and the East African country’s former finance minister, Ezra Suruma, are skeptical. “Critical minerals are not yet the safe investment that gold is,” he told The Epoch Times. “Prices are volatile. If there’s more stability, then certainly the idea of a critical minerals currency is worth investigating.” Frank Blackmore, KPMG South Africa lead economist, told The Epoch Times several factors hamper the creation of a resource-based currency. “It’s going to take a long time for most African producers to reap full reward from their critical minerals,” he said. “A lot of places don’t have adequate electricity; transport nodes are rundown. All of this counts against production. There are also shortages of skilled labor.” Mbeki suggested, though, that the initial pool of minerals be used as collateral to fund development and industrialization. “That fund could be used to encourage locally-controlled exploration and mining,” he said. Mbeki also warns that China, as much as it often declares itself dedicated to African progress, could yet be “a fly in the ointment” in the establishment of a critical minerals-backed currency. “China doesn’t usually support plans that could erode its power,” said the economist. “I can foresee the Chinese not being very cooperative in this regard, and they could even weaponize the currency to try to make sure that African countries toe their lines. “As long as the Chinese have so much power in critical minerals supply chains, this new currency is on shaky ground.” Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 10:30",
