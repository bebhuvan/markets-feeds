    "fullContent": "Registered Sex Offender Arrested For \"Humping\" Refrigerator At Trader Joes This'll make us think differently the next time we hear \"clean-up on aisle five...\" Seattle police were faced with a truly bizarre case of aisle-side aggression when they arrested a 33-year-old man accused of wielding a knife, shouting racial slurs, and getting far too intimate with a refrigerator inside a Trader Joe’s, according to KOMO News. “Here are the cold, hard facts,” the Seattle Police Department deadpanned in a press release—clearly unable to resist the pun. Nice to know they have a sense of humor about being the tip of the spear of the downfall of western society, right? According to authorities, officers responded around 2:15 p.m. to the store on the 1700 block of 16th Ave. East after receiving reports of a man threatening to kill everyone inside, using racial slurs, and brandishing a knife at store security. But that was just the beginning. Before things escalated, the suspect had reportedly been caught, in the words of a security guard, \"humping\" a refrigerator—yes, humping—and attempting to do the same to an unsuspecting customer. When confronted, he lashed out by kicking over a flower display and hurling apples like he was auditioning for a deeply unsettling produce-themed action movie. KOMO writes that it took multiple officers to wrangle the chaos. The man was arrested on suspicion of felony harassment and booked into King County Jail. Adding to the rap sheet, police confirmed he’s a registered sex offender. All in all, not your average grocery run. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 22:10",

    "fullContent": "US Government Announces ChatGPT Integration Across Agencies Authored by Vince Quill via CoinTelegraph.com, US President Donald Trump’s administration has signed a deal with OpenAI to provide the enterprise-level version of the ChatGPT platform to all federal agencies in an effort to “modernize” operations. Under the deal, all US government agencies will have access to the AI platform for $1 per agency to facilitate integration of AI into workflow operations, according to a Wednesday announcement from the US General Services Administration (GSA). The GSA, which is the US government’s procurement office, said the private-public partnership “directly supports” the White House’s AI Action Plan, a three-pillar strategy to establish US leadership in AI development recently disclosed by the admnistration. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pitches the importance of the US investing in AI during a press conference with US President Donald Trump in January. Source: CBS News Despite the modernization efforts, critics say the ongoing AI race between nation-states may have negative implications for privacy, data protection policies, censorship, narrative control, cybersecurity, civil liberties and governance. The dangers of centralized AI in government In 2023, the US Space Force, a branch of the military, paused the use of generative AI tools at the organization, including ChatGPT, due to cybersecurity concerns over sensitive data critical to national security. Large-language models (LLMs) and AI service providers would need to overhaul their data protection standards before the tools can be widely adopted by the military, said Lisa Costa, Space Force’s deputy chief of space operations for technology and innovation at the time. Public concerns over automating government work with AI have also grown as the AI industry develops. Sweden Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson recently came under fire after acknowledging that he had consulted AI for policy decisions, according to The Guardian. Tom Samuelsson, a spokesperson for the prime minister, said Kristersson did not use AI to discuss classified matters or sensitive information related to national security. Large-language models and AI chatbots intake large quantities of user data from the internet and conversations with willing users, which trains the AI. The cybersecurity risks of information storage on centralized servers are the root of the privacy concerns voiced by users, tech executives, and civil liberties activists. ChatGPT conversations could be used as evidence against a user in a court of law, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently warned. The CEO said that AI conversations do not have any kind of privacy protections and are subject to government search and seizure laws. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 21:45",

    "fullContent": "Japan Continues Drifting From Post-WW2 Pacifist Constitution, Inking Landmark Navy Deal With Australia Japan continues getting further away from its pacifist constitution adopted after World War 2, as US regional allies continue strengthen defense alliances in face of the 'China threat'. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles announced Tuesday a major deal with his country's Indo-Pacific trade partner Japan, hailed as \"the largest defense industry deal ever made between Japan and Australia.\" Australia plans acquire a total of eleven frigates from Japan in a major boost to its navy, valued at 10 billion Australian dollars (approximately $6.5 billion or €5.6 billion). Illustrative US Navy file image The major contract was awarded to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which will provide Mogami-class warships, which are highly advanced and with an array of weapons, with the bid succeeding over that of Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. \"This decision was made based on what was the best capability for Australia,\" Marles said. \"We do have a very close strategic alignment with Japan.\" \"The Mogami-class frigate is the best frigate for Australia,\" Marles described. \"It is a next-generation vessel. It is stealthy. It has 32 vertical launch cells capable of launching long-range missiles.\" This agreement marks Japan's first export of warships since before the Second World War, and only its second significant defense sale abroad, which is why some Australian analysts consider the landmark deal to be high risk. Many details of the deal still remain shrouded in mystery, but one maritime sources says: \"Under the agreement, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will supply the Royal Australian Navy with three upgraded Mogami-class multi-role frigates built in Japan from 2029. Eight more frigates will be built in Western Australia.\" Additionally, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has never built warships outside of Japan. Rabobank in a note has commented further of this factor as follows: Japan continues to increase its defense exports after decades of controls to stay out of global conflicts after World War II. Mitsubishi is going to build a fleet of frigates for the Royal Australian Navy in the coming years. The first three will be built in Japan, the remainder in Australia, bolstering the defense ties between the two countries. Both are US allies and face a threat from China. Australia aims to increase its surface fleet to its largest size since WWII. It was only just over a decade ago, in 2014, that then-prime minister Shinzo Abe partially lifted the post-WW decades-long self-imposed ban on foreign arms sales.

Analysts predict a marginal fall in Nifty at open, alongside pressure on sectors like textiles and jewellery. Emkay Global Financial notes that while the new tariffs could disrupt exports from affected sectors, the broader economy is expected to remain resilient, advocating for investment during any significant dips. Dhiraj Relli from HDFC Securities anticipates a 1-2% market drop initially but expects a resolution to the tariff situation. Meanwhile, derivatives trading shows a cautious sentiment, with call writers outnumbering put writers and a high open interest at the 24,700 strike acting as resistance. India VIX rose slightly, indicating subdued volatility, which suggests that while traders are cautious, there’s no immediate panic in the broader market.",

    "fullContent": "The American Academy Of Pediatrics: Mining Children For Profit Authored by David Bell via The Brownstone Institute, American healthcare is currently providing us with an excellent lesson in what capitalism looks like in the absence of a moral framework. The biggest losers are America’s children... The Union Profiting from Childhood Sickness The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the major professional association of North American pediatricians, has overseen the rising rates of chronic illness and medicating of American children over recent decades. With 67,000 members in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, AAP distinguished itself during Covid-19 for its strident insistence that children’s faces should be covered and they should be injected with modified RNA vaccines, despite knowing from early 2020 that severe Covid-19 was very rare in healthy children. Funded by sources including Moderna, Merck, Sanofi, GSK, Eli Lilly, and other pharmaceutical companies, the AAP’s members are the cornerstone of the rapidly increasing pediatric pharma market in North America – by far greater than any other region. As a professional organization dedicated to ensuring income for its members, the AAP is like any similar professional association or union and acts in this manner. The loss of trust in the medical profession since 2020 is fortunately removing the misconception that AAP-like medical societies were primarily altruistic, dedicated to the welfare of others rather than their members. The recent publication of AAP priorities, developed by its membership, should reinforce this loss of trust and so, despite its unusual callousness of approach, serve ultimately to strengthen public health by exposing more clearly the motivations of those profiting from rising illness. Setting Priorities to Ensure Long-Term Profit The AAP’s first stated priority is to remove parents from any authority when it comes to decisions on whether to inject their children with various substances produced commercially by its sponsors. While this should be ridiculous, it has some chance of succeeding as the ultimate beneficiaries, apart from pediatricians, are the same pharmaceutical manufacturers who heavily sponsor the election campaigns of most members of the US Congress. Of relevance, promoting or abetting chronic disease in children ensures almost certain chronic disease through adulthood. The AAP is therefore helping to set up lifelong pharmaceutical consumers. Pharma companies are purely for-profit entities, and this is exactly what their CEOs and executives are charged by their shareholders with promoting. The AAP is simply acting as a very willing enabler. The AAP considers that bodily autonomy is subservient to State-imposed requirements and that the post-World War II human rights of non-coercion and informed consent are subservient to the opinion of someone receiving money to perform an injection. Its approach coincides with the pre-War technocracy movement or medical fascism (in which a declared ‘expert’ decides on imposing healthcare measures rather than the patient themselves choosing it). However, before discussing bodily autonomy and coerced medicine further, it is worth commenting on the priority list of the AAP overall, as it is fascinating, coming from a group that insists publicly on prioritizing the health of children. Firstly, what is not there. Among the ten priorities of the AAP of which the elimination of parental rights or religious or cultural exemptions over vaccination of children is the highest, there is not a single mention of what are perhaps the three most prominent issues facing children today, and widely discussed publicly; increasing obesity and the epidemic of autism that the CDC heralds as of extraordinary proportions. While the AAP notes this problem elsewhere, it concentrates on identification and management rather than cause identification. Nowhere among its ten priorities is there any expression of interest in identifying and addressing the causes of rising chronic illness. The closest is a mention of lower costs for childhood insulin injections. The AAP’s priority list ignores diet and reducing levels of physical activity while actively promoting medicalization, seemingly oblivious to the quite catastrophic reduction in health status of the very populations they claim to be serving. Unsurprisingly for a purely marketing organization, but inconsistent with a science-based healthcare body, the priorities include nothing regarding very obvious concerns of the impact of over 70 vaccinations, with their associated adjuvants and preservatives, now given to children by ten years of age. This number has grown from just a few 40 years ago in association with the deterioration in child health outcomes. The only interest expressed in vaccines is to remove choice from those concerned about such things, and force compliance. For a society of thinking, truth-seeking people this would be extraordinary. Parents as an Obstacle to Return on Investment The justification reported from AAP President Kyle E. Yasuda, M.D., FAAP for removing any remaining personal choice regarding prophylactic medical treatment (vaccination) is “the measles outbreaks” in North America in recent years. Jesse Hackell, MD, chair of the AAP’s Committee on Pediatric Workforce, notes that they were associated with the deaths of two children, the first in “many years.” The AAP simply states, regarding safety, that vaccines are “safe,” a stupid claim in medicine and biology in that adverse events do occur to injected organic substances and metal salts, and they vary from person to person (if rare events occur, then ‘safe’ is a relative term). Associations with recent DTP injection and sudden infant death are, for example, fairly well documented. Regarding measles, it is likely that many AAP members mean well, but are genuinely misinformed regarding the impact of mass vaccination. In wealthy countries including the United States, nearly all measles mortality ceased before mass vaccination was commenced. This is not controversial – it was once stressed in medical school and is well established in national health statistics. An underlying improvement in nutrition, particularly in micronutrient deficiencies, was a likely reason. Mass vaccination then greatly reduced circulation of the measles virus, but could have only a limited impact on overall mortality. Therefore, weighing costs of vaccination (adverse events) against a very low likelihood of averting early death or disability is a real issue, and to ignore it by just reiterating ‘safe and effective’ is ignorant and foolish. Measles vaccination is good at stopping transmission because it is very effective at preventing infections from being established. This efficacy is significant to the argument that having many vaccinated is a public good. Nearly all vaccinated people will be protected, and at no risk from the unvaccinated. Thus, mass measles vaccination really only makes sense if it is accepted that people should not have freedom to choose over their own bodies and healthcare, or that of their children. The very low measles mortality, far lower than drowning even before mass vaccination commenced in the United States, effectively removed an argument for overriding parental rights. Unless, of course, we are also going to ban children from swimming or walking near rivers or on a beach. Lastly, regarding concerns over vaccination, many parents are uncomfortable with the role of cells harvested from induced aborted fetuses, often still alive at the time of harvesting. Again, many AAP members may believe the rhetoric that this is untrue, but nonetheless it is factual. It is how we derive cell cultures to develop many vaccines, so the DNA of these dead unborn humans can still contaminate the injection. The AAP, as an institution, officially holds that cultural and religious concerns arising from this should be overridden. So, in the end, the AAP’s argument seems to come down to one of two possible drivers. Either (1) they have an ideological belief that they should simply be the authority or decision-makers on children’s healthcare rather than parents (a medical-fascist approach), or (2) they see their role as promoting an extremely lucrative market for their sponsors, from which they also directly benefit, and setting children up for an entire lifetime of chronic illness and pharmaceutical consumption. It is challenging to decide which is less noble. A third possibility is also possible. Most AAP members are simply going with the flow and have not actually stopped to think through the implications of their union’s policies. However, the motivation for willfully ignoring rational thought probably does come down to a mixture of money and ego, which goes back to the two potential drivers mentioned above. Medical Fascism Should Have No Future The AAP will almost certainly continue its path of child polypharmacy, blind adherence to protocols based on the products of their sponsors, and denigration and exclusion of the opinions of parents who recognize the stark reality of deteriorating health in North American children. Parents reading the AAP’s list of priorities would be foolhardy to then entrust their children to such care. Providing that politicians retain integrity and respect freedoms that most assumed were guaranteed in the US Constitution and through basic human rights norms, the AAP will fail in its endeavors and become increasingly irrelevant to public discourse. If they get their way, we will return further toward an approach we thought we had fought wars to overcome. Fundamental rights of each human to make their own way in life, and protect and oversee their children, underpin any decent societal model. In fascist societies, such decisions are removed and taken into the hands of experts and authoritarian institutions. The people must simply comply as slaves. Medical professions and their academies have a long history of supporting such approaches, and the AAP seems increasingly determined to replicate that path. It should receive all the respect that such an indecent approach deserves. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 20:55",

    "fullContent": "Trump To Impose 100% Chip Tariffs, But Will Exempt US Investors Like Apple With CEO Tim Cook standing next to him in the Oval Office as the president announced a fresh (and very laughable) $100 billion investment plan by Apple which it would then add to the $500 billion already pledged over the next 4 years (which is ridiculous since Apple spent $43 billion in capex in the past 4 years and generated less than $100 billion in net income in its best year), Trump announced he would impose a 100% tariff on chip and semiconductor imports, but would exempt companies moving production back to the United States. Apple had previously pledged to spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years, an acceleration over its prior investments and previously announced plans, adding about $39 billion in spending and an additional 1,000 jobs annually. The announcement will bring Apple’s cumulative commitment to $600 billion, and appears to be an ad hoc bundling of pretty much everything on the income and cash flow statements, including CoGS, SG&A, CapEx, buybacks and so on. The previously-planned $500 billion was said to include work on a new server manufacturing facility in Houston, a supplier academy in Michigan and additional spending with its existing suppliers in the country. “We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors, but the good news for companies like Apple is, if you’re building in the United States, or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge,” Trump told reporters. “So in other words, we’ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge,” Trump said. “Even though you’re building and you’re not producing yet, in terms of the big numbers of jobs and all of things building, if you’re building, there will be no charge.” BREAKING: President Trump just announced a 100% tariff on chips and semiconductors. Companies that are in the process of moving manufacturing into the United States won't be charged. \"If for some reason you say you're building and you don't build, then we go back, and we add it… pic.twitter.com/LWoXQuQX8D — George (@BehizyTweets) August 6, 2025 The hollow announcement which is largely unenforceable and amounts to nothing more than a promise by Apple, represents a major victory for Apple and Cook, who have faced escalating threats from Trump’s tariffs that threatened to ratchet up the cost of producing their signature phones and computers. And while AAPL will spend precisely zero dollars, it already got the benefit of the market which sent its stock price billions of dollars higher on absolutely nothing. In theory, Apple’s $100 billion US investment will include a new manufacturing program designed to bring more of Apple’s production to the US. The company’s American Manufacturing Program partners include glassmaker Corning, Applied Materials, Texas Instruments and others, the company said. Corning will dedicate an entire factory in Kentucky to Apple glass production, increasing that company’s workforce in the state by 50%. Corning was already a supplier to Apple, making glass for the very first iPhone at the same factory. The increased pledge comes as Trump escalates a tariff push that’s set to raise costs for Apple throughout its international supply chains. Meanwhile, Trump followed through with his plans to hit India - a key production market for Apple - with 50% tariffs, the first half of which takes effect just after midnight alongside a raft of other country-specific levies designed to reduce trade imbalances. The other half, to penalize India for buying Russian energy, will take effect later this month. The president has said he could unveil separate levies on all products containing semiconductor chips as soon as next week. Cook, who attended the president’s inauguration and donated to his inaugural committee, has pushed for tariff exemptions for his company’s iPhones. Most iPhones sold in the US come from India, while the bulk of other products, including Apple Watches, iPads and MacBooks, are manufactured in Vietnam, which was hit with a 20% tariff. While details of those tariffs, and how firms would qualify for exemptions, have yet to be released, Trump singled out Cook’s Apple as an example of how to avoid the increased levies. Namely, make bombastic promises that make for glitzy headlines. Cook’s investment echoes dozens of pledges from companies since Trump won the 2024 presidential election, with CEOs flying to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, and then to the White House once he was sworn in, to court the new administration and announce hundreds of billions of dollars worth of new deals. Most if not all of these investments were already in the works prior to the November election, or were on par with previous investment trends, Bloomberg previously reported. Economists have also questioned whether all of the pledged spending, and associated job opportunities, will come to fruition. Meanwhile, Apple’s promised investments, while substantial, fall short of the full shift to US-based production that Trump and top White House officials have envisioned and encouraged. Earlier this year, the president threatened to impose a tariff of at least 25% on Apple if it didn’t move manufacturing of the iPhone to the US, a day after he met with Cook at the White House. Cook told the president that final iPhone assembly “will be elsewhere for a while,” though highlighted that several components are being made in the US. Trump, seemingly satisfied, praised the Apple leader’s plans. “Look, he’s not making this kind of an investment anywhere in the world, not even close,” Trump said of Cook. “He’s coming back. I mean, Apple’s coming back to America.” Actually, no he isn't. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 20:30",
