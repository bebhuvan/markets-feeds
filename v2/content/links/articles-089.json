    "fullContent": "Hopes of an early resolution to the US-India tariff imbroglio receded materially this week. President Trump’s out-of-the-blue decision to double tariffs on India, had India hardening its stance on continuing with its Russia trade and not giving in to demands to open up its farm sector to US imports. With India, China and Russia displaying new interest in renewing their ties, Indian investors may need to brace for tariff uncertainties to last for a while. While the swathe of sectors covered by Trump’s 50% tariff is limited to a few sectors currently (engineering, jewellery, auto components, chemicals and textiles), investors need to budget for the possibility that they get extended to exempted sectors such as pharmaceuticals and electronics, if this fracas continues. Therefore, while forecasters are pegging India’s GDP estimates down by only 50-70 basis points as a result of this escalation, it does reduce choices for equity investors in an already expensive market.",
