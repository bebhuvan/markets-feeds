    "fullContent": "'Shadow Government' Bureaucrats Exposed For Stoking Woke Insanity In Red States A new report from the State Leadership Initiative (SLI), released Wednesday, is sounding the alarm on how conservative states are quietly adopting woke policies, driven by little-known national bureaucratic organizations. A new report from the State Leadership Initiative says that conservative states are still espousing liberal policies. (Getty Images) The report, first reported by Fox News, details how a web of well-funded national associations, often posing as nonpartisan or professional groups, is behind this trend, pushing what SLI calls \"shadow governance.\" These groups set policy frameworks, control federal funding, and offer \"best practices\" that lean heavily into left-leaning priorities, according to Fox News. Among the organizations exposed in the report are the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), the National Association of Medicaid Directors (NAMD), and the National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE). SLI’s report examined 23 of the largest associations and found widespread embrace of DEI initiatives, transgender ideology policies, and ESG principles. One example highlighted in the report points to NAMD’s push for equity over outcomes in Medicaid reform. In its 2021 Regulatory Priorities document, NAMD listed 11 \"broad issues\" for improving state Medicaid programs, with \"advancing equity in Medicaid\" as the top focus. The document reads, \"Equity work should include a focus on racial and ethnic minorities, rural populations, Tribal populations, and any other groups experiencing disparate health outcomes, with an understanding that inequities are multidimensional and often fall across multiple population characteristics or categories. We also see discrete areas where focus would be beneficial, bearing in mind that the work to advance equity in Medicaid is holistic and branches across all issue domains.” \"Conservative leaders are fond of declaring victory,\" the report reads. \"They win elections, pass legislation, and appoint agency heads with great fanfare, yet, on issue after issue, the administrative state trudges forward in open defiance of their mandate: enforcing equity initiatives, embedding climate policy, and advancing bureaucratic priorities wholly alien to the voters who ostensibly elected the government. This disconnect is not incidental. It is structural.\" \"The ideological left does not need to win a single statehouse so long as it controls the bureaucratic bloodstream,” the report added. In a statement to Fox News, SLI founder and president Noah Wall said about the revelations that, \"Every single one of these associations pushes DEI.” \"It doesn’t matter how specific—whether it's a fish and wildlife group or a treasury department—DEI is a core part of their programming.” Wall demanded Republican governors to crack down on the quiet push for far-left policies and called for accountability. \"We think that Republican governors in particular need to make sure that they're sending people to these associations, knowing the problems that these associations have had in the past,\" he said. \"I don't think they have. So our goal is to educate Republican governors about the scale of the problem and make sure that they condition future membership on reforms.” This task will be far from easy. While some Republican leaders and President Trump have pushed to eliminate progressive policies like DEI from public and corporate spheres, major U.S. companies are adapting by subtly rebranding their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. A recent report by The Conference Board found that major companies, particularly those in the S&P 100 and S&P 500, are reframing rather than abandoning their DEI initiatives. Over half of S&P 100 companies adjusted their DEI messaging in 2025 SEC filings, with a 68% drop in the use of the term \"DEI\" among S&P 500 firms and a significant reduction in DEI-related metrics. \"This shift in public disclosure doesn’t signal companies are abandoning DEI,” said Andrew Jones, a researcher for The Conference Board. \"Rather, they’re selectively reframing commitments, reducing public exposure and embedding oversight more quietly yet firmly into governance and human capital management.\" Tyler Durden Thu, 08/14/2025 - 18:50",

Kennedy Jr. to retract a study that authors said showed no association between aluminum, which is used as an adjuvant in many vaccines, and chronic diseases. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in Washington in an undated file photograph. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images The journal Annals of Internal Medicine released the study on July 15. “Annals will not be retracting the study,” a spokeswoman for the American College of Physicians, which publishes the journal, told The Epoch Times in an email on Aug. 11. Danish researchers, including Anders Hviid, said they studied records from children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018 and looked for links between exposure to aluminum and 50 disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. “This nationwide cohort study did not find evidence supporting an increased risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with early childhood exposure to aluminum-adsorbed vaccines,” they stated. Kennedy said in an op-ed that there were major problems with the paper, such as the exclusion of all children who died before the age of 2 and children who were diagnosed with early respiratory conditions. “These choices suggest an intention to exclude the children at highest risk of harm,” he said, calling on Annals to “immediately retract this badly flawed study.” Kennedy also noted that supplementary material, an updated version of which was added after the paper’s publication, indicated an increased risk of Asperger’s syndrome with higher aluminum exposure. Hviid, an epidemiologist with the Statens Serum Institut, said in an article in response that the authors did not design the study to find no association between aluminum and the disorders. He said the study design was inspired by an American study, published in 2022, that found a link between aluminum exposure from vaccines and asthma. He also said he maintained that the study does not support the idea that aluminum exposure was associated with increased risks of any of the disorders. Dr. Christine Laine, editor-in-chief of Annals and a professor of medicine at Thomas Jefferson University, told Reuters that Kennedy raised issues that may underscore limitations of the study, but that the issues “do not invalidate what they found, and there’s no evidence of scientific misconduct.” “I see no reason for retraction,” she said. Laine said the journal did not plan to respond directly to Kennedy’s piece. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said the department had “no further comment than what the secretary said.” Other critics in comments to the journal highlighted how there was no comparison to unvaccinated children and said that children’s outpatient diagnoses did not appear to be included. Hviid and co-authors said in the paper that the study’s limitations included being unable to rule out associations with the disorders later in life, since they only followed up with children to the age of 8. Authors said in responses to critics that they disagreed that unvaccinated children should have been included as a reference group, and that the hospital system in Denmark includes outpatient services. Laine wrote in an editor’s note posted by the journal that Annals found the study “to be among the strongest research currently available to address the important question of whether there is an association of the dose of vaccine-associated aluminum exposure and chronic conditions in early childhood.” Reuters contributed to this report.

    "fullContent": "Meet The Artist Turning Burned Vintage Porsches Into Stained-Glass Art In a quiet Glendale warehouse, 30-year-old stained-glass artist Ben Tuna has been turning burned-out vintage cars into luminous works of art. His latest project: a 1965 Porsche 356 that survived the Palisades fire, now fitted with reclaimed church glass depicting saints, hibiscus blooms, and golden fleur-de-lis. His work was profiled by Claims Journal and Bloomberg. “When the fire happened, I started seeing all these great cars on Instagram, and I knew they’d just be thrown away,” Tuna says. “I was like, ‘I have to intercept some of these. I can do something so cool with them.’” The profile writes that Tuna’s first glass-clad Porsche, a derelict 1965 911 from Ohio, will debut Aug. 13 at the Motorluxe gala during Monterey Car Week. The Porsche 356 will follow, part of his “Resurrection” series—art pieces, not restorations. “It’s my color selection, my use of color and material, that separates my work from everyone else’s,” he says. A second-generation glassworker, Tuna inherited his skills from his father, Mark, who founded Glass Visions Studio in 1979. “My dad was an incredible artist. I got all my color knowledge from him,” he says. But the trade wasn’t his plan—until 2020, when his father suffered a stroke one month into a massive Playboy Mansion project. “Someone’s gotta do this,” Tuna recalls. He quit his job, took over the work, and ultimately installed about 250 windows in the Holmby Hills estate. “They gave me the platform to trust my instinct,” he says. Today, Tuna leads a small team producing hundreds of stained-glass installations a year, though the cars are his passion. “I never loved this work, and that’s why I’m doing stuff now that’s not traditional,” he says. “There are like 50 years of work in these cars, and I’ve only been alive for 30. That is what excites me.” The process is dangerous—cuts, lead exposure, toxic chemicals—and expensive, with salvaged church windows costing up to $250,000. But the results, Tuna says, are worth it. “The more patina—and patron saints—the better.” Tyler Durden Thu, 08/14/2025 - 18:00",

Some might say they’re responding in the only way they know how. By making a load of noise without achieving anything. Trump: “I’m going to make DC a safer place for the people who live here.” DC libtards: “We must go outside and bang pots and pans.” pic.twitter.com/s1lfj6Rqwl — Greg Price (@greg_price11) August 12, 2025 Yeah, neighbours are not going to come outside and politely ask why their kids are being woken up. Or why they’ve been disturbed from their slumber. Not in D.C. Omg so they are going to disrupt neighbors when they are putting their kids to bed to have them come outside to discuss politics? Is this real life? Pretty sure if your neighbors have to come outside to shut you up they won’t be discussing politics! — Bridget Chaz (@getoverit2210) August 12, 2025 Trump must be terrified of this devastating opposition ploy. They always come up with the stupidest ideas! — Kim D (@_Kim37) August 12, 2025 He’s surely reconsidering deployment of the National Guard. Yeah, five minutes of pots and pans banging every night at 8PM will definitely change Trump’s mind on enforcing the law. — Chloe Cardassian (@CCardassian) August 12, 2025 Where do they get these stupid ideas? 🚨 BREAKING: Democrat Rep.

    "fullContent": "China Will Ask Firms Run By Central Government To Buy Unsold Homes Once upon a time, China's property market was - as this Goldman chart from 2020 shows - the world's largest asset class. Not any more. In fact, ever since the covid crash which saw a historic collapse in Chinese real estate prices and the wholesale implosion of the country's property developers, Chinese housing has been a total and unmitigated disaster. And with most of the Chinese middle class wealth parked in the housing market, one can figure out why China's economy has been a deflationary, deleveraging hot mess for the past 4 years. It's also why, every month or so, Beijing comes up with another hare-brained, zany or batshit insane scheme to reboot the housing market (without doing the one thing that would actually boost housing, namely flooding trillions of new loans into it). And according to the latest one, China will mobilize companies owned by the central government in Beijing to purchase unsold homes from distressed property developers, following the limited success of all previous initiative that relied on local governments, Bloomberg reported. With China drowing in excess production of everything from cars, to solar panels to, well, apartments - which is the whole premise of the latest and greatest \"anti-involution\" campaign - regulators are planning to ask some of the biggest state-owned enterprises and bad-debt managers including China Cinda Asset Management to help clear the housing glut. Unfortunately, as has also been the case in all previous such overtures, there is simply not enough money to eliminate the problem of excess capacity: the firms will be allowed to tap 300 billion yuan ($41.8 billion) of funding that the central bank earmarked for the program last year. That's about 9.7 trillion yuan short of what is actually needed to clean up the housing market. The renewed effort, which is still under discussion, could help speed up the clearance of China’s 408 million square meters of excess inventory - larger than the size of Detroit - and ease the financial burden of the troubled developers. Officials are also considering scrapping a price cap for the program, in a bid to accelerate the process and improve the economics of the plan for both developers and state buyers. While the move to enlist bad-debt managers might help improve sentiment, the impact will be limited by the firms’ own stretched finances. The plan comes as China’s property sector hits a new low with the delisting of China Evergrande Group and new-home sales by the 100 largest developers falling more than 20% for two consecutive months. The People’s Bank of China launched a nationwide relending program in May 2024 to help local state-owned companies buy unsold homes, and said a few months later it will ramp up the initiative. The initiative quickly went nowhere and was a total dud. Last May, Bloomberg Economics estimated that there are about 60 million unsold apartments in the country, which will take more than four years to sell without government aid.However, progress has been especially slow with less than 6% of the announced loans approved so far. Acceleration of the program might be unlikely given a mismatch in the locations of unsold homes and demand for affordable housing. Amusingly, when China’s property sector started falling into distress more than four years ago, Beijing also sought help from bad-debt managers. Regulators told firms including Huarong and Cinda to participate in the restructuring of weak developers, acquire stalled property projects and buy soured loans. Not long after, in glorious irony, Huarong itself imploded and had to be bailed out. Then, in early 2023, the PBOC channeled 80 billion yuan of loans through the remaining bad banks to selected developers at an annual interest rate of 1.75%, while encouraging the bad banks to match that amount with funds from their own reserves. However, few projects were actually implemented under the policy, and its effect has been lackluster. As a result, China’s efforts to put a floor under the years-long real estate slump have underwhelmed as domestic demand and the job market remain weak. And without a rebound in housing - and thus houehold wealth - any attempt to kickstart the economy is doomed to failure. Meanwhile, terrified of adding to China's already gargantuan debt load, regulators have yet to offer more drastic stimulus. Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the acceleration of a “new model” for property development at the Central Urban Work Conference last month, promoting a more balanced approach to urban planning and renovation, while falling short of some investors’ expectations for more aggressive measures. The country’s home sales extended their slump in July as declining prices failed to attract buyers. Analysts including those from UBS Group AG have delayed expectations of China’s property recovery to mid-to-late 2026. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/14/2025 - 17:20",

    "fullContent": "Misinformation Scholarship Exposed As Liberal Activist Grift Authored by Paul D. Thacker via The DisInformation Chronicle, A funny thing happened when the NY Times reported a month back that Elon Musk’s exit from DC politics had been facilitated by a group of activists targeting his electric car company after he abandoned Democrats, helped fund Trump’s election, and then ran DOGE. In short, Musk supports zero Democratic Party politicians and none of their priorities. Enter Democratic activists who protested against the company run by the party’s main boogey man—protests that sometimes veered into violence and started at the impetus of sociology professor Joan Donovan. Here’s the Times report: The problem with Times story is what the Times journalist doesn’t tell us, namely the function professor Joan Donovan has served at the New York Times and other legacy news. Labeling Donovan a “sociology professor at Boston University,” skips over this purported academic’s role as a central character in the Time’s fake narrative that America is awash in “disinformation” that can only be fixed by legacy media and professors, like Joan Donovan—a misinformation authority who allegedly publishes objective scholarship with neutral, verified facts and reliable truths. “Dr. Donovan leads the field in examining internet and technology studies, online extremism, media manipulation, and disinformation campaigns,” explains one news site. “She conducts research, develops methods, and facilitates workshops for journalists, policy makers, technologists, and civil society organizations on how to detect, document, and debunk media manipulation campaigns.” In reality, the entire arena of disinformation studies has been exposed as a jobs program for liberal activists who dress up in academic garb, to provide quotes to the Times when they run articles claiming anything not published in the New York Times might be disinformation. Here’s just a few examples: August 2017 - Times quotes Donovan as “a scholar of media manipulation and right-wing extremism” commenting on a White supremacist rally; March 2019 - Times labelled Donovan a “disinformation and media manipulation” and vaccine expert May 2019 – Times quotes Donovan as “expert on misinformation” and “misleading abortion-related ads”. Dec 2019 – Times platforms Donovan as expert on political campaigns, who offers this advice, “Politicians must play some defense by understanding what information is out there that may be manipulated.” Donovan was in hot demand throughout 2020 as a quotable expert to anchor New York Times stories on alleged rampant disinformation (spread only by conservatives and Trump supporters, of course): January 2020 – Times relies on Donovan as expert voice discussing “how misleading information spreads in the age of social media” April 2020 – Times labels Donovan “researcher who studies disinformation and online extremism” pontificating on the finances of online streamers May 2020 – Times platforms Donovan as a professor quibbling over what world leaders should be allowed to post on social media April 2020 – Times promotes Donovan as voice of reason on conservative social media July 2020 – Times reporters needed Donovan’s expertise as a scholar on “the terrifying results of unchecked medical misinformation” August 2020 – Times allowed Donovan to pontificate on “conspiracy theorists who have operated in the darkest corners of the internet” September 2020 – Times reached out to Donovan for a story on child trafficking as an expert “who studies online extremism and disinformation campaigns” October 2020 – Times quotes Donovan for article commenting on election misinformation and threats to the very democracy of America, followed by another story on election day “disinformation” some days later. After 2020, Donovan posed in the Times as an expert on militias and far-right Trump supporters; pontificated on media outlets whose politics don’t align with her own; and dimparted strategic advice on the war in Ukraine. However, professor Donovan’s sparkly “scholarly” judgements tend to dull and tarnish under history’s harsh light, a common occurrence among her fellow “disinformation experts.” Right before the 2020 election, the New York Post broke a story based on documents and emails found on the laptop of Hunter Biden that implied he might be getting rich off his father’s name and that the President was aware of this. \"Well we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin ...” Congressman Adam Schiff alleged on CNN, defending Biden weeks before the election. “Clearly, the origins of this whole smear are from the Kremlin, and the president [Trump] is only too happy to have Kremlin help and try to amplify it.\" Frightened by the “RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION!!!” outcry, social media companies began censoring the Hunter Biden laptop story. But when social media companies ceased censoring the New York Post’s election bombshell scoop, the NY Times quoted Donovan claiming the censorship that began becuase of politics had ceased because of—get this—politics. “They are merely reacting to public pressure and therefore will be susceptible to politician influence for some time to come,” Donovan told the Times. At this point, much of the information on Hunter Biden’s laptop has now been validated. And after first claiming the emails and photos from his laptop were not real, Hunter Biden sued a Republican operative for published these very same emails and photos from Hunter Biden’s laptop on a website called Marco Polo. After his father gave him a blanket pardon from prosecution, Hunter withdrew his lawsuit and the founders of Marco Polo sued him for attorney’s fees. I could document other examples of Donovan’s academic musings running uncontrollably like a Southern California wildfire throughout the media before falling apart upon closer inspection, but what’s the point? Her fellow “disinformation academics” have a similar spotty history, including Renee DiResta (the disinformation “hobbyist” bounced from Stanford, now at Georgetown, who seems to have lied about her own history of spreading election disinformation); and Brown University’s Claire Wardle (who once claimed COVID vaccine mandates were a “conspiracy” and then pivoted to defend those same COVID vaccine mandates once President Biden implemented them). None of these academics retain their former credibility. Last summer, the Chronicle of Higher Education eviscerated Joan Donovan in an investigation that ran almost 11,000 words, with several of her former Harvard colleagues correcting her fibs and mischaracterizations, calling out poor research habits, and noting a chronic pattern of making unhinged accusations that lack evidence. “How I see Joan more than anything is an opportunist who will stop at nothing to put herself in an optimal position,” one of her former Harvard colleagues told the Chronicle. “Anyone who’s seen as a threat to that is somebody to be targeted, displaced, and she doesn’t care who those people are.” In response to the Chronicle’s questions, Donovan invented wild claims that shadowy forces were out to get her … including the reporter. “There are people who do want me dead,” Donovan wrote to the Chronicle, in one example, among a slew of texts. Nonetheless, it remains critical to remember the role Donovan, DiResta, Wardle and other “disinformation experts” played in lying to the public that they held some special scholarly claim on truth while they helped censor perceived political opponents during a pandemic that was the most tumultuous period in a generation. The real truth is that none of these self-ordained wizards had any exclusive understanding of falsehoods, lies or medical evidence. Like priests in the past, censorship scholars pretend to possess a unique insight to truth, a lie we can now all see quite clearly. AFTERTHOUGHT Harvard University runs a journal called the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review which publishes prestigious homilies written by the censorship clergy. In July 2023, the HKS Misinformation Review released a survey of “150 academic experts on misinformation” examining their views on the censorship field and its future. As is often the case in academic studies, the best findings can be found buried in the appendix. In appendix A we learn that “academic experts on misinformation” skew in one political direction. Guess which direction! Just take a gamble. None of the “experts” in this field are right-wing or conservative. But around 80% consider themselves Lefties. Does such a field sound like it attracts and fosters dispassionate scholars, or ideologically-aligned political priests? The HKS Misinformation Review’s mission statement says it’s a peer-reviewed, scholarly publication that publishes high-quality research that examines misinformation from “different perspectives.” Now close your eyes and imagine—just for a microsecond!—that this field skewed 80% conservative. Do you think the New York Times and legacy media would rely on professors from this field like Donovan, DiResta, and Wardle to tell you the “truth” on pretty much any topic that appears in a newspaper—elections, public health, foreign policy—if all three of these women professed views that aligned with a right-wing politician like Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene? If 80% of “disinformation academics” were conservative, do you fee confident Harvard would publish and promote their esteemed journal? Tyler Durden Thu, 08/14/2025 - 17:00",

    "fullContent": "On Eve Of Alaska Summit, Russian Forces Make Biggest Single Day Gains Of War The Russian military has gobbled up more territory in Ukraine's east, and is clearly ramping up the pressure - making rapid gains - just on the eve of the highly anticipated Trump-Putin summit in Alaska set for Friday. The week started off with international reports saying the Ukrainians evacuated ten settlements and villages along the front lines - notably among them Bilozerske - as Russian forces move in. This trend continued in the days that followed. The AFP is now documenting more: \"Ukraine on Thursday ordered more evacuations in the east, from a town close to where Russia's army recently made a swift breakthrough, as Moscow steps up pressure ahead of the U.S.-Russia summit,\" the report says. A regional military Ukrainian official who oversees Donetsk region additionally confirmed, \"We began the mandatory evacuation of families with children from the town of Druzhkivka.\" He described that four more villages near the town were also evacuated, and detailed that in total 1,879 children were remaining in the settlements. Russa on Wednesday into Thursday declared its forces had captured the village of Iskra and the small town of Shcherbynivka the Donetsk region. With these developments, AFP offered the following conclusion: Russian forces had on Tuesday swiftly advanced by up to 10 kilometers (six miles) in a narrow section of the front line near the towns of Dobropillia and Druzhkivka. This was their biggest gain for a 24-hour period in over a year, according to an AFP analysis of data from the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW). According to more based on the ISW study: The Russian army took or claimed 110 square kilometers (42.5 square miles) on August 12 compared to the previous day, according to AFP analysis of battlefield data from the Institute for the Study of War. It was the biggest advance since late May 2024. In recent months, Moscow has typically taken five or six days to progress at such a pace, although Russian advances have accelerated in recent weeks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said this is a clear indication that Putin doesn't actually want to end the war, after earlier this week accusing him of \"bluffing\" when he talks about the prospect of ceasefire. \"We see that the Russian army is not preparing to end the war. On the contrary, they are making movements that indicate preparations for new offensive operations,\" Zelensky said in a fresh statement. Putin knows he is clearly in the driver's seat on the eve of the Alaska summit. Trump would have to offer something very big indeed - in the form of territorial concessions and a pledge of no NATO membership for Kiev. However, Ukraine has also said it would accept no decisions from the summit, give it doesn't have any input or participation. They are 'dead' on arrival, the Zelensky government has made clear. Russian officials are attempting to exploit the tactical penetration near Dobropillya to influence the upcoming US-Russia summit in Alaska, but the Kremlin's overall strategic objective is to break the will of Ukraine, the United States, and Europe in order to achieve Russia's… https://t.co/NnyGY3P6uR pic.twitter.com/N6hogaGi0u — Institute for the Study of War (@TheStudyofWar) August 13, 2025 Currently, the US and Ukraine seem to have the idea of a 'freeze' on the table - which would allow for Russian troops to stay in their current positions in the Donbass - but without giving permanent political recognition of Russian sovereignty. Putin may not accept this, as he likely feels he's in a position to settle the issue once and for all on the battlefield, and political recognition would be a forced reality the West would have to eventually deal with. But it's also possible that he could see in such a ceasefire an opportunity to regroup and rest his forces, in order to then later expand operations even more rapidly, and solidify total control over the whole of the Donbas region.
