The divestitures coincide with a new report suggesting he's mulling over a¬†potential acquisition of CNBC.

    "summary": "Trump, EU Reach Tariff Deal To Avoid Trade War President Trump said he reached a trade deal with the European Union late on Sunday, avoiding a trade war with the US‚Äôs largest trading partner and marking his biggest deal so far in his attempt to remake the global trading system through higher tariffs for U.S. trading partners. The pact comes less than a week before a Friday deadline for President¬†Donald Trump‚Äôs higher tariffs to take effect on August 1. The president in May threatened to impose a 50% duty on nearly all EU goods, adding pressure that accelerated negotiations, before lowering that to 30%. Trump made the announcement at Trump Turnberry, his seaside golf resort in western Scotland, after meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who leads the EU‚Äôs executive body. üö®BREAKING: President Trump lands EU trade deal: - EU to purchase $750 billion in US and invest $600 billion in US - EU to purchase a ‚Äúvast amount‚Äù of military equipment - EU opens up markets ",

President Trump‚Äôs signature piece of legislation allocated $3.3 billion to the DOJ, some of which will go toward the Byrne-JAG Grant Program, a federal initiative created in 2005 which provides support for local law enforcement and criminal justice efforts. To access the new funds, which supplement the $499 million already appropriated for the Byrne-JAG program in 2025, localities must comply with a section of federal immigration law that forbids them from restricting communication between their law enforcement entities and the Department of Homeland Security regarding an individual‚Äôs immigration status.

There were also instances of drowning as aid was dropped into the sea during the 2024 efforts. For example a single day in March of last year saw¬†18 people die trying to desperately access the aid. But given that at this point scores of people are dying each day from hunger, air drops are increasingly a risk everyone (or Western countries) is willing to take - even as Israel's military is still exercising a tight grip on what aid is allowed into Gaza and who distributes it.
