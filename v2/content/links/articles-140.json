    "fullContent": "London Train Passengers Eject, Detain Deranged Man Exposing Genitals In Front Of Children Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, Passengers on a TFL train in London took matters into their own hands as a deranged lunatic completely exposed his genitals to the entire carriage, which contained children, then exploded into a rage when he was told to get off the train. Video shows that the guy pulled down his pants for all to see and just stood there on the on Hammersmith and City line train in the middle of the afternoon. When the guy was challenged by a male passenger, and told to pull up his pants or get off the train, he began repeatedly and aggressively screaming “F**K OFF.” Why do we have to put up with this? https://t.co/srtqGxIYqc — m o d e r n i t y (@ModernityNews) August 8, 2025 “What do you mean f**k off? You need to get off the f**king train. Now. There are kids on here,” the passenger responded. The half naked guy then continued to yell and wave his own belt around, prompting more male passengers to step in and begin delivering what can only be described as an ass whipping. As the train came to a stop at a station, the passengers threw the lunatic to the platform where one of them detained him. British Transport Police issued a statement saying the man has been detained under the Mental Health Act. “Officers were called to reports of a man exposing himself on the District Line at East Ham Underground station,” the statement reads, adding “The man had been assaulted by a number of other passengers and was initially arrested by an off duty officer, before being detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to hospital, where he remains.” “An investigation into the incident is ongoing,” the statement concludes. I'm amazed the cops didn't arrest the men who complained and threw him off the train. — Maggie MAC (@MaggieM77391666) August 8, 2025 Watch this space… Instead of calling this what is was, a deranged potentially dangerous lunatic exposing himself and being dealt with accordingly, sections of the media and leftists online have decided to frame it as an attack on a a person having a “mental health crisis.” Fix this headline… pic.twitter.com/h8XJ7EjQrh — m o d e r n i t y (@ModernityNews) August 8, 2025 This My London article claims “A man in a mental health crisis was beaten by members of the public,” describing the the man as “visibly appearing in distress.” Others online complained about how the “crisis” guy was dealt with. Nudity on public transport is unacceptable. The man in the viral video is clearly suffering a psychotic episode and the violence he received is excessive. — Alexander Bramham (@BramhamAlex) August 8, 2025 “Calmly restrain” 😂😂😂😂 Excuse me naked man, do I have consent to touch you? Ok I’m going to restrain you now, please get on the ground and put your hands behind your back. Thank you for complying sir, permission to touch you again? I just want to make sure you’re… — Migas (@ElixirDiablo) August 8, 2025 No, they tried to talk him. He cursed them. Then the men appropriately responded to the situation. I thank God for men like these in the video. As women we need to know our roles and know when to be quiet. The women who moved away from the situation had good judgment. Mental… — wOa (@TIHfirst) August 8, 2025 The safety of the vulnerable in our society — including children and the elderly — is more important than this misguided compassion you're proposing — Andrei Muntean (@_andreimuntean) August 8, 2025 Yes, he’s clearly full on mental, but what would you have the passengers do? Stroke his forehead? Sing him a lullaby? “It’s mental health” everything wrong with our society. Great to see people actually taking a stand protecting the rest of the passengers — Callum (@CLH_TEN) August 8, 2025 More of this needs to start happening instead of it being tolerated and allowed. He obviously had mental health issues but they did the right thing by subduing him so that he didn’t escalate into worse behavior, especially since there were kids on the train. — Mrs. S (@701Nurse) August 7, 2025 The London Evening Standard ran with the headline “Tube passengers attack naked man who exposed himself in front of children,” as if they started the incident. Attacked? They dealt with a threat — Pie1984Red (@Pie1984Red) August 8, 2025 He had plenty of warning before they attacked him. — ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (@PezD_Spencer) August 8, 2025 Attack? Justifiably deal with — Partridge (@NW5Arsenal) August 8, 2025 Are we just supposed to tolerate this behaviour? Indecent exposure should be tolerated then – is that your inference? think not the guy then screams FO at those who ask him to pull trousers up! Are we expected to tolerate this now? He persisted in front of women & children – appropriate citizens arrest done — Nicola Delglyn (@DelglynNicola) August 8, 2025 Unsurprisingly, others almost instantly started calling it a “racial” attack: Yeah so this is not how you handle a man having psychotic episode or bad drug trip on a train surrounded by vulnerable people. It’s actually the opposite way you should handle this. They made a bad situation several times worse. Also likely there was some racial aspect to this. https://t.co/HGQq9oFG6R — Economic relations? I hardly knew her! (@Jack_Witek) August 8, 2025 No doubt we’re going to hear more about this incident in the coming days. * * * Your support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

    "fullContent": "A History Of American Recessions The official designation of a recession comes from a committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a private, nonprofit research organization. The committee considers a wide range of economy-wide, monthly data points, but the NBER views GDP as “the single best measure.” The committee calls a recession once there is a significant decline across these measures for more than a few months. The NBER’s official designation of a recession, then, doesn’t happen until there are several months of data, allowing it to be sure both that a recession happened and when exactly it started. In other words, as Voronoi notes, the NBER looks backward, not at the present moment. Source: Voronoi Using this measure, here's a few insights: From 1855 to 2020, recessions lasted an average of 17 months. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the average recession has decreased to 14 months. The US' longest recession lasted 65 months from October 1873 to March 1879 The US has gone through 13 recessions since WWII The longest recession since WWII was the Great Recession The shortest US recession was during COVID-19, from February to April 2020 Although economic struggles and the Great Depression marked the 1930s, the NBER-defined recession lasted from September 1929 to March 1933. In other words... there used to be more 'official' recessions. Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 07:35",

    "fullContent": "Last Line Of Defense: USA Intervenes Against EU Digital Surveillance Submitted by Thomas Kolbe, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has launched a lobbying campaign against the EU’s Digital Services Act. With this step, Americans have become the last line of defense for the free speech rights of EU citizens. If, in the past, U.S. President Donald Trump often spoke of the European Union as “a tough nut to crack,” he couldn’t have been more accurate. Freedom-loving EU citizens know exactly what he meant. In Brussels, a bizarre mélange of control fetishism, economic dirigisme, and isolation from the outside world has developed—a combination that is no longer tolerable. Not least, Brussels’s fight against free expression in the digital sphere has revealed the true intentions of the von der Leyen Commission: the recovery of narrative dominance and control over political dissidence—achieved by cold-bloodedly sacrificing citizens’ fundamental freedoms. U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance already issued multiple warnings in the spring about a European censorship empire. In a speech in the U.S. Senate, he denounced European digital legislation as an attack on Western liberties. In his address at the Munich Security Conference, he went so far as to suggest cutting ties with the Europeans if they did not reverse their illiberal, dictatorial trajectory. Criticism Bounces Off As usual, American criticism fell on deaf ears in Brussels. Although Brussels swallowed the bitter pill of an asymmetrical trade deal with the U.S. two weeks ago, both the hidden protectionism disguised as climate regulation and harmonization standards, as well as the repressive digital laws, remain intact. This is detrimental not only to free speech among Europeans but also for American companies—undoubtedly a key target of the EU censors. The EU’s discriminatory ambitions through the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the corresponding Digital Markets Act (DMA) primarily target U.S. communication platforms like X, Telegram, and Meta. If these platforms don’t conform to EU rules—granting access to internal communications and aiding Brussels’s surveillance efforts—they face billions in fines. Much like Britain’s digital ID program, Brussels now masks its shamelessly invasive censorship with claims of youth protection and anti-hate measures. It’s tiresome to hear—but, as always, it’s about “their democracy,” or, to put it more accurately, a massive concrete barrier constructed to shield against the audacious citizen seeking to preserve privacy from an unbounded EU bureaucracy. Next Round with Rubio It seems Americans, even before EU citizens, have finally lost patience with Brussels. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is next in line to confront the EU Commission, stepping into attack mode. This week, Rubio instructed all U.S. embassies across the EU to initiate a coordinated lobbying blitz against Brussels’s censorship package surrounding the DSA. The allegation: Under the guise of security and responsibility, the EU is deliberately suppressing free speech in digital spaces and targeting U.S.-based platforms and communication companies. Rubio has tasked his diplomats with urging governments and regulators to amend the DSA. At the same time, they are to record and report censorship incidents involving U.S. citizens and companies to ramp up pressure for reform. This marks another daring challenge from Washington to the EU’s expansive control apparatus. The trade war between the U.S. and the EU has now shifted fully into the digital realm. Brussels’s response to Rubio’s initiative was swift. In an official statement, the EU Commission flatly dismissed the censorship allegations: “The claims of censorship connected to the DSA are entirely baseless. Freedom of expression is a core right in the EU.” They added coldly: “Our EU regulations and standards were never up for discussion—and they will not be.” In other words, Brussels refuses to be swayed in building its digital citadel of narrative control—least of all by Washington. Loss of Narrative Control The U.S. attempt to protect its businesses from EU overreach draws them into a broader clash between EU citizens and Brussels’s increasingly omnipotent central authority. Brussels senses growing public pressure and feels exposed amid a deepening economic crisis. Grand narratives—like human-caused climate change and the need for open borders to avert a demographic crisis—are eroding public consensus and exposing Brussels’s failed centralization of Europe’s economy. We are witnessing Brussels’s last desperate stand to defend its narrative monopoly against a rising opposition that is increasingly reclaiming public and media spaces. What happens in the U.S. now matters fundamentally for EU citizens. Under President Trump’s administration, Europe-inspired climate agendas are being reversed, and funding for public media and NGOs is being rolled back. The air is clearing—spaces open for fresh discourse and honest reckoning with recent history. Brussels’s errors in climate dirigisme and centralized planning are now apparent for all to see. It would be unthinkable today in the U.S. for a leading figure like Ursula von der Leyen to quietly escape scandal—say, over the Pfizer-Corona controversy. That is the political maturity that Washington exemplifies and Brussels starkly lacks. The Turning Point Is Here This shift in public discourse owes much to initiatives like Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and renewed defense of free speech on platforms like Telegram. These are spawning counter-narratives that expose Brussels’s planning failures by setting them against reality. We are emerging from Plato’s cave, seeing who cast the shadows on our walls. Washington’s interests may be economic—but they resonate with EU citizens. Those in the EU who yearn for a return to a Brussels central authority that oversees fair competition in an open single market should feel gratitude for unexpected U.S. solidarity. It is the strongest alliance we could ask for. Brussels’s push for centralization and power armor has outrun democratic checks—and that is dangerous.
