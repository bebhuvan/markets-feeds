The mood was also cheered by a report that Trump and Putin are expected to meet for summit talks in the next few days while hopes for a rate cut rise some more as additional Fed officials have dovish pivots. As of 8:15am ET, S&P futures are up 0.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures gain 0.7% with Mag7 higher led by AAPL while Semis are the global standout. Eli Lilly & shares plunged after the drugmaker reported underwhelming study results for its weight-loss pill. Shares of its main European rival, Novo Nordisk A/S, soared. Cyclicals are poised to rip, although as JPM notes \"today appears to be setting up for an ‘Everything Rally’.\" Bond yields are down 1bp across the curve but 10Y is +1bp; USD is flat but has erased ~25bp of overnight losses. Today’s macro data focus is on Jobless Claims, 1Y Inflation Expectations, Nonfarm Productivity, Labor Costs, Consumer Credit, and Inventories. While none, ex-Claims, are market moving it will help sharpen the macro picture on the labor market and consumer. At 12pm, Trump will sign an executive order that aims to allow private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency and other alternative assets in 401(k)s. In premarket trading, Mag 7 stocks are all higher (Apple +2%, Nvidia +1.4%, Meta +0.9%, Alphabet +0.6%, Microsoft +0.6%, Tesla +0.5%, Amazon +0.1%).. Airbnb (ABNB) is down 6% after warning that growth rates may not keep up later this year due to tough year-ago comparisons. Aris Water Solutions (ARIS), which helps manage water produced from oil drilling, climbs 20% after the company agreed to be bought by Western Midstream Partners in a ~$1.5b equity-and-cash transaction. Corning (GLW) gains 5% after Apple said it’s planning to onshore 100% of iPhone and Watch cover glass production to the US as part of an expanded $2.5 billion partnership with the high-tech glassmaker.

A gauge of regional tech stocks climbed by the most since June 24. Meanwhile, Indian equities fell after the US moved to double the tariff on imports from the South Asian nation to 50%.

U.S. trading partners are lobbying the White House for exemptions to sweeping new tariffs that went into force on Thursday, as countries seek ways to muffle the impact on their economies of President Trump’s push to reorder global trade. The diplomatic effort shows months of trade talks are far from over despite the run of agreements trumpeted by the White House in the past month. WSJ President Trump has claimed that his sweeping tariff regime will reshore American companies and revive manufacturing in the U.S. So far, that hasn’t happened. Economic activity tied to manufacturing has shrunk for most of Trump’s second term. From March to July, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted. The Manufacturing PMI last registered at 48, below the 50 score that differentiates growth and decline. WSJ The Kremlin said Thursday that a meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has been agreed in principle and will happen in the “coming days,” teeing up their first in-person encounter of Trump's second term. NBC Trump said he may punish China with additional tariffs over its purchases of Russian oil. Trade adviser Peter Navarro played down the likelihood, saying higher duties “may hurt the US.” BBG Trump will sign an executive order today that aims to allow private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency and other alternative assets in 401(k)s. BBG China’s exports grew at a faster clip in July, showing that U.S. tariffs so far haven’t curtailed China’s export machine, although trade with America has fallen. Trade numbers for Jul come in ahead of expectations, including exports (+7.2% vs. the Street +5.6%) and imports (+4.1% vs. the Street -1%). WSJ Japan cut its growth forecast for the current fiscal year as US tariffs and persistent inflation weigh on the economy. BBG Caught between rising costs from tariffs and belt-tightening consumers, big retailers are clashing with the producers of consumer brands such as Nivea-maker Beiersdorf and brewer Heineken as they look to avoid sticker shock that could hurt sales. The disputes - which have dented some brands' sales - underscore the challenge for consumer goods makers and sellers, with inflation and tariffs pushing up input costs and price spikes in commodities such as coffee. RTRS Fed's Daly (2027 voter) said there's cautiousness which is tempering growth but not stalling out, while she commented that they will likely need to adjust policy in the coming months and can't wait for perfect clarity to act. Daly also commented that tariffs are unlikely to boost inflation persistently in a way that monetary policy would need to offset. She also noted that the labour market has softened and additional slowing would be unwelcome. Furthermore, Daly said they need to recalibrate monetary policy to match risks to the Fed’s goals. Trade/Tariffs US President Trump said they are going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors, which will be at approximately 100%, but added \"if you're building in the US, there will be no charge.\" US President Trump posted late on Wednesday that \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA.\" US official said the 15% tariff will stack on top of pre-existing tariff rates applied to imports from Japan, unlike in the case of the European Union, according to Kyodo. South Korea claimed Samsung Electronics (005930 KS) and SK Hynix (000660 KS) will not be subject to 100% US tariffs, while Taiwan said TSMC (2330 TT) is exempt from US President Trump's 100% chip tariff. Apple (AAPL) suppliers are reportedly betting on a tariff carve-out for India-made iPhones, according to Nikkei sources.

ASX 200 pulled back from record highs despite the surprise growth of imports from Australia's largest trading partner. Nikkei 225 pared initial losses and briefly reclaimed 41,000 amid a busy slate of earnings and as markets shrugged off comments from a US official that the US will not exempt Japan from stacking 15% tariffs on top of existing levies.

S&P affirms China's Sovereign rating at A+/A-; Outlook Stable. Overview: Strong fiscal stimulus will help keep China's economic growth resilient amid continued headwinds from the weak property sector and new pressures on external trade. \"We affirmed our 'A+' long-term and 'A-1' short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on China.\" The stable outlook on the long-term rating reflects our view that the Chinese economy will return to self-sustaining growth of above 4% over the next few years, paving the way for smaller annual increases in net general government debt. Downside scenario: \"We could lower the ratings if we believe the government will continue with larger fiscal stimulus measures than we currently expect over the next three to five years. This would likely stem from more persistent downward pressure on economic growth than we currently expect. The resulting fiscal impact would cause the net change in general government debt to stay close to, or above, 6% of GDP annually.\" Upside scenario: \"We may raise our ratings on China if fiscal consolidation is faster than what we anticipate, resulting in a persistent decline in net general government debt to below 30% of GDP, or government interest payments falling below 5% of revenue consistently, or both.\" European bourses (STOXX 600 +0.9%) opened mostly higher, albeit with very modest gains. Since then, indices gradually edged higher, then followed by a more pronounced bid following commentary from a Russian Kremlin aide, who said an agreement had been made for a Presidential meeting between Trump and Putin, in the next few days. European sectors opened mixed but now hold a slight positive bias. Insurance takes the top spot, lifted by post-earnings strength in the likes of Allianz (+2%) and Zurich Insurance (+1%). Elsewhere, Travel & Leisure has been buoyed by upside in IHG, after it reported strong H1 metrics; European gambling names are also broadly higher today, in tandem with upside in US-peer DraftKings which reported a record rev. and EBITDA. The Tech sector finishes off the top 3, benefiting from a) the risk tone and, b) US President Trump announcing that the US will slap 100% tariffs on imported chips, but will exempt those firms who manufacture in the US/have committed to do so. On this, ASML (+2%) has gained, given the proposition incentivises relocating to the US, which may boost demand for manufacturing units. Top European News Germany's VDA says the EU-US trade deal has brought no clarity or improvement for the German auto industry. FX DXY is down for a second day in a row and extending its move below its 200DMA at 98.21. The USD is continuing to be hampered as markets contemplate Trump's next move with regards to personnel at the Fed. Note, the USD may also be losing ground as geopolitical tensions recede a touch with the Russia and Ukraine conflict potentially nearing a conclusion. Today's data docket includes weekly claims data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow Tracked and the NY Fed SCE release. Next downside target for DXY comes via the 29th July low at 97.49. EUR is a touch firmer vs. the broadly weaker USD in a week that has been lacking in incremental drivers for the Eurozone. Some positivity for the bloc may be gleaned from developments on the geopolitical front following Wednesday's discussion between the US and Russia, which was said to have made progress and with President Trump intending to meet Russian President Putin as soon as next week. EUR/USD has extended its rise on a 1.16 handle but is yet to crack the 1.17 mark with the pair topping out at 1.1698. In what has been an indecisive start to the week for USD/JPY, the Yen is eking out mild gains vs. the greenback. This comes in spite of comments from a US official that the now-effective 15% tariff will stack on top of pre-existing tariff rates applied to imports from Japan, unlike in the case of the European Union. USD/JPY delved as low as 146.70 overnight but has since made its way back onto a 147 handle. GBP is relatively steady vs. the USD as markets brace for the upcoming BoE rate decision, minutes and MPR. Analysts are virtually unanimous in expecting the BoE to lower the Base Rate by 25bps to 4.0% with markets assigning a 93% probability of such an outcome. The move would follow the MPC’s preference for cutting at a quarterly pace and alongside MPR meetings. With regards to the decision to lower rates, consensus looks for a 7-2 outcome. With the likes of Mann and potentially one of Pill or Greene to vote for an unchanged rate. However, when looking at the magnitude of the vote split, this could lead to a three-way split in the event that MPC dove Dhingra and one of Ramsden or Taylor backs a larger 50bps reduction. Antipodeans are both are building on the gains seen on Wednesday vs. the USD with upside today following on from encouraging Chinese trade data which showed a surprise growth in imports and a larger-than-expected increase in exports. PBoC set USD/CNY mid-point at 7.1345 vs exp. 7.1709 (Prev. 7.1409) Fixed Income USTs are flat and ultimately awaiting today's risk events which include; jobless claims, unit labour costs, Atlanta Fed GDP Now and then a 30yr auction. As a reminder, the prior day saw a soft 10yr outing after a poor 3yr earlier. No further insight into the potential fat finger in USTs seen on Wednesday in the run-up to supply, where 30 minute volume spiked to over 300k from sub-100k throughout the session to that point. As a reminder, the move also occurred alongside a move in the implied odds (via Polymarket) for the next Fed Chair, with NEC Director Hassett’s jumping by just under bp and overtaking former Fed Governor Warsh as the front-runner. his morning, action (and volumes) has been much more minimal with USTs in a very narrow 112-03+ to 112-07 band. Bunds are a little lower. No reaction to the morning’s Industrial and Trade data from Germany for June. Though, Bunds did pick up a little bit a handful of minutes after the data came through. The soft set of Industrial data, to the lowest since May 2020, potentially influenced; a series that may have factored into the pressure seen in the DAX 40 future at the time. Since, newsflow has slowed a little but more recently Bunds have edged a little lower back towards lows. Gilts were flat but more recently some pressure has been seen. The BoE is expected to cut rates and likely via a 7-2 split to ease. However, the full vote breakdown could see a three-way split. Mann and potentially one other (possibly Pill or Greene) likely to vote for unchanged, while Dhingra and possibly the likes of Taylor and/or Ramsden voting for a 50bps cut. Leaving a majority of Bailey, Lombardelli, Breeden and then possibly one or more of Pill, Green, Taylor or Ramsden; depending on the above. Benchmark opened lower by 14 ticks before extending another six to a 92.45 trough. Since, it has reverted back towards Wednesday’s 92.65 close into the BoE. Spain sells EUR 5bln vs exp.

This follows the decline on Wednesday amid Russia/Ukraine optimism following the discussion between the US and Russia, which is said to have made progress and with President Trump intending to meet Russian President Putin as soon as next week. Russia's Kremlin this morning confirmed that US President Trump and his Russian counterpart, Putin, will meet, and preparations for a summit in the next few days are underway. WTI currently resides in a 64.12-65.08/bbl range while Brent sits in a USD 66.70-67.58/bbl range. Precious metals are rebounding following the prior day's losses, with spot gold marginally gaining after recent dollar weakness and as reciprocal tariffs took effect. Some pressure seen on the aforementioned Trump-Putin meeting announcement, which saw the yellow-metal swing from highs back towards overnight ranges. Currently in a USD 3,365.30-3,397.58/oz range. Copper futures are rangebound with a slightly firmer tilt amid the softer dollar, risk appetite in stocks, and the encouraging Chinese trade data overnight, which showed stronger-than-expected exports and surprise growth in the nation's imports. 3M LME copper prices reside in a USD 9,672.90-9,740.00/t range. Kuwait's oil minister expects crude prices to remain above USD 72/bbl; says the market is healthy with moderate demand growth. Geopolitics: Ukraine Kremlin Aide Ushakov says an agreement has been reached to hold a meeting with US President Trump and Russian President Putin in the next few days. Meeting venue has been agreed and will be announced later. US Envoy Witkoff touched on an idea of a three-way meeting between Trump-Zelensky-Putin; Moscow left it without comment. US President Trump said they had very good talks with Russian President Putin and there's a good chance that there will be a meeting very soon, while he also commented that more secondary sanctions are coming regarding Russia. US Secretary of State Rubio said it was a good day regarding efforts to end the Ukraine war but there is still a lot of work ahead and many impediments to overcome. Ukrainian President Zelensky said he discussed Witkoff's visit to Moscow in a call with Trump and said that Russia should end this war, while he also commented that pressure on Russia is working and it's crucial they do not deceive them, as well as commented that it looks like Russia is more inclined to a ceasefire. Ukrainian President Zelensky calls on Russian President Putin to hold meeting to 'end war', via Al Arabiya. Geopolitics: Other South Korean military said South Korea and the US are to conduct major joint military exercises beginning on August 18th although an official stated that some parts of the joint drills are postponed to September, while the military drills will test an upgraded response to a heightened North Korea nuclear threat.

Momentum was also supported by strong earnings and rising hopes of imminent rate cuts as Fed speakers turned more dovish in response to last Friday’s weak payroll print. The upbeat tone has continued overnight despite Trump outlining a plan for 100% tariffs on semiconductors, with the impact of these mitigated by carveouts. US equity markets had a strong day yesterday with S&P 500 (+0.73%) and Nasdaq (+1.21%) closing less than 1% from record highs, while the Mag-7 (+1.93%) was lifted by a +5.09% spike in Apple’s shares. That came as the company announced additional $100bn of investments into the US, particularly in new manufacturing. This comes on top of an earlier pledge of $500bn investment over four years and as the company has sought to reduce tariff risks. During a White House event with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Trump then said that “we’ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors”. However, he added that companies that are building, or “have committed to build”, capacity to move production to the US would face no charge. Imports of electronics have so far been exempt from tariffs. While it’s not clear exactly how it will work, the new floated exemption has added a sense of relief for markets overnight, with Taiwan’s chip giant TSMC up +4.44% and Korea’s Samsung +1.74%. In terms of the major indices, the Nikkei (+0.68%) and the KOSPI (+0.72%) are visibly higher, while the Hang Seng (+0.52%) and the Shanghai Composite (+0.12%) are seeing more modest gains. Futures on both the S&P 500 (+0.27%) and the NASDAQ (+0.31%) are also higher overnight. The other major tariff news yesterday was a new US executive order outlining an additional 25% tariff on India in response to its purchases of Russian oil, which would bring the total levies on Indian exports to 50%. India’s government called the latest tariffs “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”. The executive order also leaves the door open for tariffs on other countries “directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil”. Trump said there could be “a lot more” secondary sanctions related to Russian oil, including potentially on China, but that this would depend on how talks proceed. Brent crude fell for a fifth consecutive session (-1.11% to $66.89/bbl) yesterday, the longest such run since May, though it is up +0.8% this morning. In addition to India being the only target so far, the sanguine oil reaction came as the additional 25% tariffs will kick in only after 21 days, leaving ample time for negotiations. Later in the day we heard that Trump could meet Russia’s President Putin as soon as next week, with reports citing a call that Trump had with European leaders after his envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow. Trump himself said there was a “very good chance” he would meet soon with Putin and Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy to try and broker peace, though he was more ambiguous on the likely timing. Secretary of State Rubio said that “a lot has to happen” before Trump meets with Putin. In the latest news on the Fed’s leadership, Trump said he will likely nominate a temporary Fed governor after Kugler’s departure on August 8, adding that the decision would come “over the next two, three days” and that there were “probably” three candidates for the role. A temporary replacement for the remainder of Kugler’s term until January would avoid the person being seen as a likely candidate for Fed Chair once Powell’s term ends in May. Meanwhile, Fed officials on Wednesday struck a more dovish tone in response to Friday’s soft jobs report. Fed Governor Cook said the report was concerning, with significant downward revisions “somewhat typical of turning points” in the economy. Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari suggested that in case of a slowdown in the economy, a cut might be appropriate “in the near term”, whileSan Francisco President Daly said “we will likely need to adjust policy in the coming months” as additional labour market slowing was “unwelcome”. Pricing of a September Fed rate cut ticked up from 90% to 95% amid the shifting rhetoric, with 60bps of cuts priced by the December meeting (+2.0bps on the day). In turn, 2yr Treasuries rallied by -1.0bps, but yields moved higher at the long end, with the 10yr up +1.5bps to 4.23%, and 30yr up +3.8bps to 4.82%. That came amid a soft 10yr auction that saw $42bn of bonds issued +1.1bps above the pre-sale yield, with the bid-to-cover ratio at its lowest level in 12 months. 10yr yields are another +1.5bps higher overnight. Increased rate cut expectations saw the dollar index (-0.61%) fall to its lowest level in nearly two weeks. Meanwhile, the Swiss franc has been the worst performing G10 currency this week as Switzerland’s President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington yesterday without securing any easing of the 39% US tariffs that came into force along with other new country rates overnight. Back to yesterday’s equity moves, there was some softness beneath the headline gains with more than half of the S&P 500 constituents lower on the day, led by a decline in healthcare stocks (-1.52%). The Philadelphia semiconductor index (-0.20%) underperformed following underwhelming results from AMD (-6.42%) and Super Micro Computer (-18.29%). Other notable post-earnings movers included McDonald’s (+2.98%), whose same store sales grew more strongly (3.8% yoy vs. +2.6% expected), and Walt Disney (-2.66%), which saw profit guidance weighed down by its movie and TV businesses. Over in Europe, the Stoxx 600 (-0.06%) was again dragged down by another decline for Novo Nordisk (-5.36%) as it released its latest earnings. The pharma giant’s shares are now down -36% since its profit warning last Tuesday. However, most European indices gained with the DAX (+0.33%), CAC (+0.18%), FTSEMIB (+0.65%) and FTSE 100 (+0.24%) all in the green. In one of the more unusual stories, pharma conglomerate Bayer AG (-9.92%) was the worst performer in Stoxx 600 in part as it revealed that its earnings had been recently inflated by football player transfer receipts stemming from its ownership of Bayer Leverkusen. I will let Jim opine on whether Liverpool’s club record signing of Florian Wirtz in June which boosted Bayer’s bottom line was a good deal. European government bonds saw a modest sell off on Wednesday, with yields on 10yr bunds (+2.7bps), OATs (+2.7bps) and BTPs (+2.1bps) all higher. Pricing of ECB rate cuts ticked lower, with amount of easing priced by year-end down -1.3bps to 15bps as outgoing Austria central bank governor Holzmann said he saw no reason for another rate cut. Staying with central banks, today the Bank of England is expected to deliver a 25bp rate cut to 4.00%, which would mark the fifth cut in the BoE’s gradual easing cycle. Our UK economist Sanjay Raja expects divisions on the committee, foreseeing a 2-5-2 vote across no change, -25bp and -50bp options. You can see Sanjay’s full preview here. Turning to the data, yesterday was quiet in the US but investors will be dissecting today’s jobless claims for whether evidence of US labour market deterioration is visible outside of payrolls. In Europe, June factory orders in Germany surprised to the downside at -1.0% mom (vs. +1.1% expected), with components such as transport equipment (-23%), autos (-7.6%) and fabricated metal products (-13%) slumping. The moves suggest a drag from tariffs with foreign orders weighing while domestic orders rose by almost 4%. On a more positive note, euro area retail sales pointed to a resilient consumer, rising by an expected +0.3% mom in June but with the yoy reading at a stronger +3.1% thanks to revisions (+2.6% expected). In goods trade data out of China this morning, both exports (+7.2% yoy vs +5.6% exp.) and imports (+4.1% vs -1.0% exp.) grew more strongly than expected in July. So suggesting a resilient aggregate trade performance of the world’s primary manufacturing hub, even as China’s exports to the US fell by -22% yoy. To the day ahead, the main highlight in Europe will be the Bank of England’s latest policy decision, along with the subsequent press conference with Governor Bailey. In terms of data, we'll have the initial and continuing jobless claims out in the US, while in Germany the highlight is June industrial production. Looking at earnings, the focus will be on Eli Lilly and Toyota Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 08:30",

    "fullContent": "Kremlin Confirms Trump-Putin Meeting 'In Coming Days' The Kremlin has on Thursday belatedly confirmed that a meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has been agreed to and will take place in the \"coming days\". The White House first unveiled it yesterday, as reported in the NY Times, but it was as yet unclear to degree to which Moscow was on board. But now Russia has agreed \"in principle\". According to a statement of Putin’s longtime foreign policy aide, Yury Ushakov, \"At the suggestion of the American side, an agreement in principle was made to hold a bilateral meeting at the highest level in the coming days.\" He laid out that the idea of a Trump-Putin-Zelensky meeting (which apparently Washington pushed for) \"for some reason was mentioned by Washington yesterday\" but \"not specifically discussed,” Ushakov added, explaining that the Russian side \"left this option completely, completely without comment.\" Meeting during Trump's first term. Sputnik/Reuters This was in reference to the intense three-hour meeting that Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff had with both Putin and his top negotiator and investment chief Kirill Dmitriev. \"We have launched work to discuss the parameters of such a meeting and the venue for it jointly with our American colleagues now,\" Ushakov said additionally. \"By the way, I’d like to note that the venue, too, has been agreed in principle and will be announced a bit later,\" he added. Putin's office has described that the interest in a face-to-face meeting, which will mark the first of Trump's second term - was mutual. One location being already floated as a possibility is the United Arab Emirates. As for a Zelensky meeting, President Trump has indicated this would happen just bilaterally soon following his sit-down with Putin. Trump had been quoted Thursday as saying \"that there will be a meeting [with Putin] very soon\" and \"that we could be ending\" the Ukraine conflict. \"We haven’t determined where [the meeting would take place], but we had some very good talks with President Putin today.\" But this is all a bit surprising as nothing has fundamentally changed in the warring sides' stances. Moscow has not backed off its maximalist war goals, and will not budge from giving up the four eastern territories it has long declared part of the Russan Federation after a popular referendum, or what was fundamentlally annexation vote. The Zelensky government hasn't issued any indication that it's ready for territorial concessions - and it even wants to keep laying claim to Crimea. Meanwhile the tariffs offensive continues, with more taking effect overnight: After months of threats, delays and extensions, President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs took effect overnight, raising the overall average tariff rate to more than 17%, its highest since the Great Depression. Everything from European Union appliances and Japanese cars to food, furniture and toys from China TVs from South Korea will be hit. However, selected oil and gas imports, along with some smartphones and goods covered by a pre-existing trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, are not affected. Trump has indicated his trade offensive won’t stop. The president said he still plans to impose import taxes on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Amid that pressure, Apple said it plans to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years amid pressure from Trump to shift its supply chain to American soil. Meanwhile, Trump hiked the tariff rate for India to 50% because of the nation’s purchases of Russian oil, and he said he could raise the European Union’s tariff level to 35% from 15% if it reneges on an investment commitment. PUTIN AND TRUMP MAY MEET IN DUBAI, UAE \"The UAE is one of the suitable places for the meeting [with Trump],\" - Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, during his meeting with UAE's Mohammed bin Zayed at the Kremlin. pic.twitter.com/HqBYnT9Enu — Russian Market (@runews) August 7, 2025 As for the upcoming meeting, Anti-Kremlin punits have accused Putin of using the whole dialogue with Washington as a way to keep stalling - all while sustaining battlefield gains - and to gain a reputational boost. They see Putin as having everything to gain with a direct meeting with Trump, in terms of global standing and domestic opinion - but he's not expected to make any significant compromise. At this point from Moscow's point of view the fate of the war is being decided, but wholly on the battlefield. Ukraine's near-daily cross-border drone attacks also means the Russian military is unlikely to take its foot of the gas pedal operationally. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 08:25",

    "fullContent": "\"Chat Control\" - EU Proposal To Scan All Private Messages Gains Momentum Authored by Amin Haqshanas via CoinTelegraph.com, A controversial European Union proposal dubbed “Chat Control” is regaining momentum, with 19 out of 27 EU member states reportedly backing the measure. The plan would mandate that messaging platforms, including WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, must scan every message, photo and video sent by users starting in October, even if end-to-end encryption is in place, popular French tech blogger Korben wrote on Monday. Denmark reintroduced the proposal on July 1, the first day of its EU Council presidency. France, once opposed, is now in favor, Korben said, citing Patrick Breyer, a former member of the European Parliament for Germany and the European Pirate Party. Belgium, Hungary, Sweden, Italy and Spain are also in favor, while Germany remains undecided. However, if Berlin joins the majority, a qualified council vote could push the plan through by mid-October, Korben said. A qualified majority in the EU Council is achieved when two conditions are met. First, at least 55 percent of member states, meaning 15 out of 27, must vote in favor. Second, those countries must represent at least 65% of the EU’s total population. EU Chat Control bill finds support. Source: Pavol Luptak Pre-encryption scanning on devices Instead of weakening encryption, the plan seeks to implement client-side scanning, meaning software embedded in users’ devices that inspects content before it is encrypted. “A bit like if the Post Office came to read all your letters in your living room before you put them in the envelope,” Korben said. He added that the real target isn’t criminals, who use encrypted or decentralized channels, but ordinary users whose private conversations would now be open to algorithmic scrutiny. The proposal cites the prevention of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) as its justification. However, it would result in “mass surveillance by means of fully automated real-time surveillance of messaging and chats and the end of privacy of digital correspondence,” Breyer wrote. Beyond scanning, the package includes mandatory age verification, effectively removing anonymity from messaging platforms. Digital freedom groups are asking citizens to contact their MEPs, sign petitions and push back before the law becomes irreversible. An infographic explaining the proposed EU Chat Control bill. Source: Patrick Breyer France faces societal collapse over censorship Last month, Telegram founder Pavel Durov warned that France risks societal collapse if it continues down a path of political censorship and regulatory overreach. Durov was arrested in France in August 2024 after being accused of failing to moderate his app to reduce criminality.
