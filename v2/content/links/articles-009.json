    "fullContent": "Newsflash: Governments Lie Authored by Ron Paul via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace & Prosperity, Bureau of Labor Statistics head Dr. Erika McEntarfer is one of the latest persons President Trump has told “you’re fired.” President Trump said this month that he fired Dr. McEntarfer because the president believed she manipulated jobs data. Manipulations, he stated, include the updated May and June BLS numbers showing the U.S. economy created 258,000 fewer jobs than originally reported, as well as the weaker than expected July jobs report. All of this, the president suggested, was designed to make President Trump look bad. Following Dr. McEntarfer’s firing, many commenters worried that President Trump’s actions would create the perception that government unemployment and inflation data is manipulated to produce the numbers desired by the president. A loss of confidence in government statistics could impact demand for US Treasuries. This is because the value of Treasuries is adjusted based on the BLS-issued Consumer Price Index (CPI). If investors don’t trust the CPI figures, they can demand higher returns, increasing government’s interest payments. President Trump is correct that BLS manipulates statistics related to the economy, but it has been doing so since long before Donald Trump moved to the White House. For example, starting in 1994, the BLS stopped including “discouraged” workers who have stopped looking for work in the official unemployment figures. The BLS also includes those working part-time as employed even if the only reason they are working part-time is they cannot find full-time work. According to John Williams, publisher of the website Shadow Stats, including discouraged and part-time workers who want full-time work in the unemployment figures increases the unemployment rate by almost 20 percent! The government also understates the effects of inflation. One way it does this is by using “chained CPI.” Chained CPI means that even if price inflation has made steak unaffordable for most Americans, the government does not consider their standard of living lowered if they can buy a “substitute” such as hamburger. This ignores the fact that if consumers viewed hamburger and steak as equivalent then they would likely have chosen cheaper hamburger before Federal Reserve-caused price inflation made steak unaffordable, leaving them no choice but to purchase hamburger. According to John Williams’s Shadow Stats, using a more accurate definition of inflation would increase the inflation rate to as much as 12 percent. Manipulating the unemployment and inflation rates allows the government to gaslight the people into believing that the economy is strong and any signs of weakness — such as rising prices or an increase in unemployment in their town — are anomalies that do not reflect the economy’s real condition. Manipulating the inflation figures to understate the true amount of inflation also lowers the “cost of living” increases the government must provide for veterans, beneficiaries of Social Security, and others. This provides a way for government to cut spending without Congress members having politically difficult votes President Trump has done a service by highlighting that government statistics regarding the economy are manipulated. Many of those criticizing President Trump for endangering the “credibility” of government’s inflation and unemployment numbers are either unaware of, or more likely have no problem with, manipulating data to fool the public into thinking the welfare-warfare system and the fiat money system are “working.” They only object to manipulating the data to benefit President Trump. President Trump should ensure the government’s unemployment and inflation figures are as accurate as possible by appointing John Williams of Shadow Stats to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Wes Moore's Approval Plummeting The Democratic Party is in trouble over their beloved Maryland Governor Westley Watende Omari Moore, who is being positioned for the party's 2028 presidential run, as his polling numbers crater amid a tsunami of mounting crises. I wonder why. https://t.co/IC5BQgL9h7 — Robin Grammer (@RobinGrammer) August 11, 2025 \"Governing is hard. Just ask Governor Wes Moore — plummeting 14 points in a year, scraping a dismal 50% approval in deep-blue Maryland,\" Change Annapolis, a bipartisan group of taxpayers, wrote in a post on X. Change Annapolis continued, \"Marylanders are tired of his presidential vanity tour, crushing tax hikes, and an energy crisis of his own making,\" adding, \"He's polling worse than O'Malley and Glendening at this point in their terms.\" Gov. Moore and his team of leftist radicals are running Annapolis into the ground, fueling a series of crises: a fiscal disaster and massive deficit, crushing tax hikes (setting the stage for a continued resident exodus to GOP-led states), an open-door haven for criminal illegal aliens, crime-ridden streets across major metros, and, worst of all, what's now being formally acknowledged: a full-blown \"manufactured\" power crisis. This energy crisis, a direct byproduct of failed green policies (in combination with AI data centers), has ignited power bill hyperinflation, hammering both poor and wealthy households while financially crushing mom-and-pop businesses. The first sign of the Democratic Party's panic over Moore's sliding poll numbers was in June, after a network of dark-money-funded NGOs purchased ad space on local radio stations and launched a propaganda brainwashing campaign to quell the growing wave of dissent surfacing across the state. Far-Left Panic: Dark Money NGO Floods Baltimore Airwaves With Propaganda To Save Governor https://t.co/UBLdVX7fXf — zerohedge (@zerohedge) June 28, 2025 In recent weeks, Moore has played the blame game, telling constituents that power bill hyperinflation is the direct result of the regional grid operator, PJM. Yet it was Democrats in the state that championed failed globalist \"green\" policies that led to the premature retirement of reliable fossil fuel power generation for intermittent solar and wind, leaving the grid more fragile than ever. It's an unbelievable disgrace what the Democrats have done to the people of this state. https://t.co/ogqeCHafQQ — Robin Grammer (@RobinGrammer) August 11, 2025 ... and residents found out on Monday afternoon about just how fragile the grid has become with all that fossil fuel spare capacity taken offline after hours of blackout power threats across central Maryland. \"Prepare Now\": Substation Failure Puts Baltimore At Risk Of \"Widespread\" Blackout https://t.co/pCbEvuXk7P — zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 11, 2025 The Maryland Freedom Caucus described yesterday's blackout threat as \"a direct result of radical, extremist energy policies from Maryland Democrats and Governor Wes Moore, which are driving reliable power plants toward closure and leaving our grid on the brink.\" In recent weeks, the Trump administration threw Democrats in the state a massive political lifeline to prevent rolling blackouts by granting a 90-day emergency waiver allowing the H.A. Wagner power plant to exceed pollution limits during peak energy hours. The exploding power bill crisis in Maryland, in the era of AI data centers, should have never existed if responsible lawmakers in Annapolis hadn't enacted foolish energy policies that retired stable fossil fuel power generation over some alleged climate crisis. The accountability monster has now been released in the state - and this has so far shown up in sliding poll numbers for Moore - that could get a whole lot worse if power bills continue marching higher.

Everyone follows orders from above to keep things organized. In police, officers obey sergeants, who obey captains, up to the chief—you!… — Grok (@grok) August 12, 2025 Okay, DC Police: President Trump, as Commander in Chief, is the big boss. He can take control in emergencies and picked AG Pam Bondi as his stand-in. So, orders go: Trump → Bondi → your Chief → you. Follow the ladder to keep things safe and organized! — Grok (@grok) August 12, 2025 Trump announced the deployment of approximately 800 National Guard troops to D.C. alongside the federalization of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department, citing a “public safety emergency” due to what he described as rampant crime and lawlessness in the nation’s capital. Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allows the president to take control of the police for up to 48 hours during emergencies, extendable to 30 days with congressional notification, to justify this unprecedented move. He claimed the city had been “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals,” pointing to high-profile incidents like the assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer during an attempted carjacking. Trump framed the deployment as “Liberation Day” for D.C., aiming to restore order and address issues like homelessness, graffiti, and potholes, with Attorney General Pam Bondi overseeing the police and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth coordinating the National Guard’s efforts.
