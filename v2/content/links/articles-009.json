    "fullContent": "Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund Ups Its Indirect Exposure To Bitcoin Authored by Vince Quill via CoinTelegraph.com, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest state-directed wealth fund in the world, increased its indirect Bitcoin exposure by 192% over the last year, according to crypto research company K33 Research. The fund has indirect exposure to 7,161 BTC through its investment portfolio, which includes treasury companies Strategy and Metaplanet and crypto exchange Coinbase. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund continues to increase its Bitcoin and crypto exposure. Source: Vetle Lunde The fund currently holds over 11.9 billion Norwegian krone ($1.2 billion) of Strategy’s stock, a 133% increase from 2024. Similarly, the fund has increased its Coinbase holdings by over 96% since 2024. Norway’s increase in BTC holdings reflects a broader trend of sovereign wealth funds gaining indirect exposure through BTC investment vehicles and corporate proxies, as the world’s first cryptocurrency becomes integrated into the traditional financial system. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund also increased exposure to BTC holding company Strategy in 2025. Source: Norges Bank Investment Management Sovereign and state wealth funds enter crypto game through the side door Sovereign wealth and state pension funds legally mandate managers to invest only in pre-defined asset classes such as fixed-income securities, corporate bonds, equities and others. Because of these restrictions, fund managers who want to invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies must gain indirect exposure through an investment vehicle like an exchange-traded fund (ETF), a corporate bond or a company proxy like Strategy. The State of Wisconsin State Investment Board (SWIB), the organization that manages the US state’s pension system, was one of the first state-level pension funds in the country to disclose indirect Bitcoin exposure through a $164 million investment into BTC ETFs. In February, SWIB disclosed that its BTC holdings nearly doubled, surging to over $321 million, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. The pension manager sold off BTC holdings in May but retained a $50 million position in BTC proxy Strategy. Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund announced in July that it plans to convert a portion of its assets to crypto. Timur Suleimenov, head of the National Bank of Kazakhstan, said the prospective move is intended to generate more investment income for the wealth fund, and the government is also exploring converting other assets like gold and foreign currency reserves to crypto.

Soldier operates the milling machine in a 3D printing facility to complete a stainless steel part during Exercise Trident Warrior.

The event is designed to ensure only proven systems advance toward procurement, and it draws heavily on feedback from fleet personnel. Working alongside the Marine Corps, the Navy showcased 3D printing capabilities that are already in use, some installed in shipping container-sized mobile labs that can be deployed aboard vessels or sent to forward bases. The printers can produce parts ranging from a small hinge to a load-bearing titanium component, and in some cases deliver them off-site via drones or unmanned surface vessels, TheDefensePost.com reports. “This is Uber for manufacturing, delivered at the speed of Amazon across the globe for nuclear-grade propulsion parts,” Lt. Col. Michael Radigan of the Marine Innovation Unit said in an interview with FOX 5/KUSI. He added that operating such systems in contested environments is one of the program’s most promising - and challenging - aspects. Jacob Lopez, lead manufacturing technologist at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Corona Division in Fallbrook, Calif., emphasized that the ability to fabricate parts on-site is critical because neither ships nor aircraft can carry every spare they might require. “We’re using cutting-edge technology,” he said. “We need to make sure our warfighters are safe, we can get them home, and save lives.” Mr. Lopez cited one example in which a part with a six- to nine-month lead time and a $30,000 replacement cost was produced in just three days. He also trains service members to operate the equipment so they can make battlefield repairs themselves. The exercise also highlighted “cold spray” repair technology, which can restore a damaged helicopter beam mid-flight - a job that could otherwise require months of work and hundreds of labor hours. Officials said the capability has the potential to save significant time and resources across the fleet. Military planners see applications that extend beyond mechanical fixes. Lt. Col. Radigan said the same technology could one day be used to produce urgent medical supplies during deployments, further extending the resilience of forces operating far from established supply lines.
