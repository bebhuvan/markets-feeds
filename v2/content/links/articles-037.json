    "fullContent": "Goldman Finds \"Sharp Declines\" In Import Prices As Foreigners Absorb Trump's Tariffs Back in late June, we were first to point out something startling: contrary to conventional wisdom according to which prices of heavily-tariffed goods would surge and spark runaway inflation (just skim this from certified idiot Paul Krugman), we found just the opposite, namely that Japanese passenger car export prices had plunged by the most on record, demonstrating that it was foreign producers that were eating the bulk of the tariffs, certainly in this particular case. well would you look at that: guess who is eating all those tariff costs (hint, it's not US consumers) pic.twitter.com/iwdKyeqTII — zerohedge (@zerohedge) June 22, 2025 Three days later, our chart ended up in front of Fed Chair Jerome Powell during his periodic grilling in Congress, where he was unable to give a clear explanation as to why the export prices of Japanese autos would be plunging in response to sharply higher tariffs (the answer, of course, is simple: foreign producers simply can not pass through costs to the US market without losing much if not all of their market share, so they have no choice but to eat the loss). well would you look at that: three days later Powell has to discuss this chart https://t.co/6AfkRRSjJp pic.twitter.com/SOGjff2Fsl — zerohedge (@zerohedge) June 25, 2025 Fast forward to today when Goldman, similar to Morgan Stanley over the weekend, tried to analyze why those tariffs which it - and so many other economists predicted incorrectly - would already have sent inflation soaring, have failed to do so. While there is a bunch of stuff in the report (which pro subs can read at their leisure here), what was most notable is the \"discovery\" that it's not just Japanese car makers. As Goldman's Jan Hatzius reveals, \"we find that US import prices on tariffed goods have declined somewhat, suggesting that foreign exporters have absorbed some tariff costs by lowering their export prices to the US, unlike during the 2018-2019 trade war.\" Our updated analysis shows that a 1pp increase in the product-level tariff rate led to a 0.25% cumulative decline in import prices over the first three months of implementation, with minimal impact thereafter. Of course, here Goldman had to mix fact with projection to not sound like a bunch of wrong, confused career economists. When one strips away hypothesis and forecast, here is what actually happened: \"following the implementation of China and auto tariffs, import prices (exclusive of tariffs) of both consumer and non-consumer goods from China, as well as import prices of passenger cars (exclusive of tariffs) from the EU and Japan, all experienced sharp declines.\" Looking forward, Goldman concludes that whereas \"foreign exporters had absorbed 14% of the cost of all tariffs implemented so far through June, their share will rise to 25% if the more recent tariffs follow the same pattern as the earliest tariffs on China.\" This also means that the 9% increase in the effective tariff rate through June has reduced import prices by at least 1.3% so far, and that the total 14% increase in the effective tariff rate that Goldman expects in 2025 will likely reduce import prices by 3.7%, if not much more assuming foreign producers continue to keep prices reduced to remain competitive with lower-cost domestic producers. The rest of the Goldman note goes on to do what Morgan Stanley tried to do yesterday: forecast just when all those tariffs will eventually finally show up in inflation... an exercise they have to do because both giant banks were very wrong in incorrectly assuming that inflation would already be far higher than it is so far. Don't be surprise if tomorrow's CPI comes in tame yet again, prompting even more revisions to Goldman's inflation ETA. Much more in the full Goldman note, available to pro subscribers.

    "fullContent": "\"Prepare Now\": Substation Failure Puts Baltimore At Risk Of \"Widespread\" Blackout Over a million residents across central Maryland, particularly in the Baltimore metro, were warned moments ago by the local utility that a substation failure linked to a major power plant could trigger widespread blackouts this afternoon. The alert comes barely a week after President Trump handed Maryland Governor Wes Moore and the Democratic Party in Annapolis a political lifeline to prevent power blackouts, underscoring the fragility of the state's power grid under the weight of failed Democrat-driven green energy policies. It's an unbelievable disgrace what the Democrats have done to the people of this state. https://t.co/ogqeCHafQQ — Robin Grammer (@RobinGrammer) August 11, 2025 Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) has asked all 1.3 million of its electric customers in central Maryland \"to conserve electricity to reduce the potential for widespread outages this afternoon and evening, due to a power plant experiencing an unplanned disconnection from the BGE electric system.\" BGE is asking all customers to conserve electricity to reduce the potential for widespread outages this afternoon and evening as the result of a power plant experiencing an unplanned disconnection from the BGE electric system. — BGE (@MyBGE) August 11, 2025 The Maryland Freedom Caucus reports that a substation linked to the Brandon Shores Power Plant experienced a failure earlier today, which could leave the supply insufficient when demand peaks later. As a result, Baltimore City and surrounding areas may face rolling blackouts this afternoon. The Maryland Freedom Caucus blamed what it called \"irresponsible Democrats\" and their \"failed green energy policies\" for the crisis. The Maryland Freedom Caucus urges residents in affected areas to take precautions to limit the impact of any outages. But make no mistake—this crisis is the direct result of radical, extremist energy policies from Maryland Democrats and Governor Wes Moore, which are driving reliable power plants toward closure and leaving our grid on the brink. This situation has the real possibility of being a regular occurrence if we do not change course. We renew our call to Governor Moore to stop relying on federal bailouts and use his executive authority to protect Maryland's energy future: Keep our existing plants open and reopen recently closed facilities End the Green Energy Scam mandates strangling our economy Eliminate the EmPOWER surcharge that drains ratepayers without cooling their homes Immediately add nuclear to Maryland's Tier 1 energy options. A short time ago, we were alerted to a substation failure that feeds the Brandon Shores Power Plant that may result in brief blackouts in the Baltimore region. We are urging impacted residents to prepare now but also those who can be held accountable to step up and do the right… pic.twitter.com/vQjqutPNhl — Maryland Freedom Caucus (@MDFreedomCaucus) August 11, 2025 Last week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright granted Democrats in the state a massive political lifeline to prevent rolling blackouts by granting a 90-day emergency waiver allowing the H.A. Wagner power plant to exceed pollution limits to avoid rolling blackouts in the Baltimore metro area. We no longer need to explain how Maryland is becoming the epicenter of the Democratic Party's imploding policies - all on display for the nation to see, especially on the green issue. \"Another Reason To Leave\": Top Maryland Power Official Warns Of Regular Rolling Blackouts Maryland Democrats Scramble As Green Energy Agenda Sparks Power Bill Hyperinflation Democrats Spark \"Manufactured Power Crisis\" In Maryland As Left Begins To Panic \"You're Welcome\": Pennsylvania Boasts About Saving 'Green' Maryland From Near Power Grid Collapse Far-Left Panic: Dark Money NGO Floods Baltimore Airwaves With Propaganda To Save Governor Trump Admin Throws Maryland Democrats A Lifeline To Halt Power Blackout Threat After Green Policies Backfire Meanwhile, failed green policies and increasing baseload power demand, driven by data centers, EVs, and other electrification trends, have created a perfect storm of hyperinflated power bills for residents.

    "fullContent": "Massachusetts Teachers Demand New Wealth Tax Authored by Jonathan Turley, I have long opposed wealth taxes based on both constitutional and practical grounds. When Elizabeth Warren pushed her own wealth tax, I noted that the high starting income or wealth levels would likely be lowered with time if Congress were ever allowed to cross this constitutional Rubicon. The Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA) is now demanding an amendment to the state constitution to tax the “wealth of the richest 1%” to pay for free public college. Previously, the state passed a constitutional amendment to place a 4 % tax on income above $1 million. This would add a new wealth tax to that earlier “Fair Share Amendment.” In a press release, the teachers union president Max Page declared: “if we are serious about social and economic justice and nurturing a culturally rich and welcoming state of involved citizens, we will provide all residents with the best vehicle for a prosperous future – public education.” New York City socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has made a similar proposal that, in addition to taxing corporations, he will “tax the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers—those earning above $1 million annually—a flat 2% tax.” Not surprisingly, Warren recently declared Mamdani the future of the Democratic Party. Massachusetts is already in the top ten highest tax jurisdictions. These tax increases are why many of us have opposed the state and local (SALT) tax deduction. As high-tax states continue to increase their rates, they expect residents in low tax states to subsidize them. My forthcoming book, Rage and the Republic: The Unfinished Story of the American Revolution, discusses the wealth tax controversy and how these moves are likely to increase in the coming years.

    "fullContent": "Israeli Strike Kills 5 Al Jazeera Journalists In Gaza, IDF Says They Were Part Of Hamas Cell Israel's military (IDF) has stepped up its bombing of Gaza City, and already there are mounting civilian casualties and an international outcry, especially after a well-known regional reporter and his crew were killed in a weekend strike Five journalists and staff members working for Al Jazeera were among seven total people killed in a late Sunday night strike. They were sheltered in a press-marked tent near Al-Shifa hospital, various sources indicate. The Hamas-run Government Media Office in Gaza has condemned the attack on the press group as \"deliberate and premeditated\". It's identified prominent Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif as among the dead. The 28-year-old Al Jazeera Arabic journalist was known to have reported extensively from northern Gaza, and recently Israel identified him as among six 'compromised' journalists from Al Jazeera who have alleged ties with Hamas. The network has said Israel is falsely seeking to justify its war crimes against journalists. Anas al-Sharif. Source: Al Jazeera Also among the dead weere Mohammed Qraiqeh and three photographers: Ibrahim Zaher, Moamen Aliwa and Mohammed Noufal. However, Israel is claiming these were military targets and not journalists. The NY Times writes, \"The Israeli military confirmed that it had conducted a strike targeting one of the men killed, whom it accused of being a Hamas fighter posing as a reporter, an allegation that he and the network had rejected.\" The United Nations is not accepting Israel's defense of its actions, instead calling the attack a \"serious violation of international humanitarian law.\" The UN issued a statement on X saying, \"We condemn the Israeli military’s killing of six Palestinian journalists by targeting their tent — a grave breach of international humanitarian law,” and emphasized that “Israel must uphold its obligation to protect all civilians, including journalists.\" The UN further said at least 242 Palestinian journalists have died in Gaza since October 7, 2023, and is urging greater security and protection for journalists in the midst of the conflict. \"Israel must respect and protect all civilians, including journalists,\" it said. Funerals for the men are already underway on Monday. As for Anas Al-Sharif, the IDF alleges he was leading a Hamas cell. The Qatar-based Al Jazeera network is pushing back: Meron Rapoport, a veteran Israeli journalist and editor of the Local Call news site, has said the Israeli military’s accusation that Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif was a Hamas member “doesn’t make sense at all”. “The Israeli explanations are, at best, very lacking,” Rapoport told Al Jazeera from Tel Aviv. He said that if the claims were true, Israel would have been expected to have targeted or arrested al-Sharif a long time ago. He said Israel likely targeted al-Sharif now because of two main factors – first, his important role in “telling the world that there is famine in Gaza”, which “really hurt Israel internationally”; and, second, because of the planned upcoming invasion of Gaza City, which Israel wants to minimise coverage of. Al Jazeera offices in Israel and the West Bank have already long ago been raided and shut down by Israeli security forces. Israeli leaders have long conisdered the Mideast regional channel to be adversarial. Journalist Anas al-Sharif along with four other Al Jazeera staff have been killed by an Israeli attack which targeted a tent for the press outside al-Shifa Hospital’s main gate. pic.twitter.com/hfwWdDCCji — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) August 11, 2025 It was only in July that Al Jazeera warned that Israel threatened to directly target its correspondent Al-Sharif: Al Jazeera Media Network has denounced the Israeli military for what it called a “campaign of incitement” against its reporters in the Gaza Strip, including most notably Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Anas al-Sharif. In a statement on Friday, Al Jazeera said it “strongly condemns and denounces these relentless efforts, which have consistently incited against its staff since the beginning of its coverage of the ongoing Israeli war on Gaza”. In May of 2022, the IDF shot dead an even more well-known Al Jazeera journalist. Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian Christian, was killed while covering the siege of Jenin refugee camp. She had been wearing a press vest at the time and was huddled with other journalists at the moment she was shot. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 15:05",

    "fullContent": "Fatal 'Laughing Gas' Poisonings Skyrocket As Recreational Use Spreads Authored by George Citroner via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), The last decade has seen a 578 percent rise in deaths due to nitrous oxide poisoning, a new research letter shows, revealing a sharp rise in U.S. fatalities linked to the gas—often called “laughing gas”—over the past 13 years. Ink Drop/Shutterstock The colorless, odorless gas is used recreationally as a euphoric and hallucinogenic drug. The same drug used as anesthesia in dentists’ offices is now easily purchased by teenagers at corner stores and inhaled for a quick high—and it’s proving increasingly deadly. “On the streets, the slang term for nitrous oxide is ‘whippits,’” Brian Townsend, a retired supervisory special agent with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and not involved in the study, told The Epoch Times. “The gas comes from canisters, typically released into balloons before the user inhales it. This gives them a brief euphoric feeling or ‘high.’” Fatalities have climbed from 23 in 2010 to 156 in 2023, with researchers linking the increase to the spread of whippits among American youth. A Steep Increase In the letter, recently published in JAMA, researchers examined death records from 2010 to 2023 using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database. The study focused on fatalities among Americans ages 15 to 74, where nitrous oxide poisoning was identified as the cause of death. They found a mortality rate of 0.01 per 100,000 population in 2010, which climbed to 0.0622 per 100,000 by 2023. While deaths showed a consistent upward trend, researchers noted a particularly sharp increase after 2016, when fatalities jumped from 120 to 149. “At that continued rate, we could be looking at a much larger problem,” Andrew Yockey, University of Mississippi assistant professor of public health and author of the research letter, stated in a press release. “We have evidence that nitrous oxide poisoning is a very real danger, but this is very often ignored or trivialized,” said letter co-author Rachel Hoopsick, assistant professor of health and kinesiology at the University of Illinois. “Sellers of nitrous oxide rarely, if ever, provide health warnings. I think the public sees it as a party drug.” The findings also highlight a growing public health concern related to the misuse of nitrous oxide, with researchers emphasizing the importance of increased awareness and prevention strategies to reduce these preventable deaths—especially as recreational use appears to be rising. Researchers also noted that young people were the most common users of nitrous oxide, with eighth graders making up a large portion of those misusing inhalants. Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an advisory warning consumers not to inhale nitrous oxide products, which are not federally controlled, due to the potential for severe adverse health events if used recreationally. Flying Under the Radar Nitrous oxide is readily sold in canisters from smoke shops. Researchers and addiction specialists point to concerning marketing practices that may target young people. Nitrous oxide products come in flavored varieties with names like bubblegum and mango. “There is no age limit, and this is available online and in gas stations across the country,” Yockey stated in another press release. Townsend said homeless people with substance use disorders often use nitrous oxide because it’s inexpensive and easy to get. Nitrous oxide is one of those substances that “flies under the radar” because it seems harmless, said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, quadruple-board certified in pulmonary, sleep, internal, and critical care medicine and chief medical advisor for Sleepopolis. “This study highlights a problem that’s quietly gotten worse over the years,” Dasgupta said. Serious Health Risks Recreational use can deprive the brain of oxygen, leading to short-term effects like dizziness or unconsciousness and long-term issues like nerve damage or even paralysis. “There’s also a serious risk of addiction and mental health decline when use becomes habitual,” said Sarah Grado, chief programs officer at notMYkid, a nonprofit dedicated to helping youth overcome addiction challenges. It is unclear how nitrous oxide causes side effects, but inhaling large amounts of it can cause asphyxiation, and heavy use can cause vitamin B12 deficiency over time, which can cause nervous system issues like lasting nerve damage or difficulty walking. Inhaling large amounts of the gas in a short period can cause nitrous oxide poisoning, Grado said. Symptoms of nitrous oxide overdose include seizures, psychosis, rapid heartbeat, and tightness in the chest. Prolonged inhalation of nitrous oxide recreationally can also lead to weakness in the limbs, problems with bowel and bladder control, and psychiatric problems such as dissociation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and depression. Recreational nitrous oxide is unregulated and used without medical supervision, said Jessica Tate, chief clinical officer at Milton Recovery Center. In medical settings, the drug is mixed with oxygen, but recreational users often inhale it in its pure form, making it far more potent and dangerous. Social Media Influence According to the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, more than 13 million Americans have misused nitrous oxide in their lifetimes. Social media exposure showing people using nitrous oxide is also driving increased use, according to Michele Bowers, clinical director and therapist at Sophros Recovery. “Think back to big tobacco; they deliberately targeted young people with cartoons, fun flavors, and flashy colors,” Hoopsick said. “That is a parallel we’re seeing now with nitrous oxide.” Bowers noted that many health care providers lack sufficient training to recognize nitrous oxide abuse and often do not screen for it.
