Also, it has been shown that, for the most part, Consumers aren’t even paying these Tariffs, it is mostly Companies and Governments, many of them Foreign, picking up the tabs. \" Then took direct aim at Goldman Sachs: \"But David Solomon and Goldman Sachs refuse to give credit where credit is due. They made a bad prediction a long time ago on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves, and they were wrong, just like they are wrong about so much else. I think that David should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ, and not bother running a major Financial Institution.\" Ouch! Meanwhile, just between us girls, Goldman has been somewhat more in the 'one-time, marginal' incremental impact of tariffs (as opposed to the UMich terror tantrum), with one of their latest notes highlighting the \"\"Sharp Declines\" In Import Prices As Foreigners Absorb Trump's Tariffs.\" well would you look at that: three days later Powell has to discuss this chart https://t.co/6AfkRRSjJp pic.twitter.com/SOGjff2Fsl — zerohedge (@zerohedge) June 25, 2025 ...even though Jan Hatzius did claim that US firms are eating up to two-thirds of the increased tariff costs most recently (even though that was not evident in the earnings data this season). American consumers have absorbed roughly 22 percent of the costs from President Donald Trump’s tariffs through June, but that is expected to swell to 67 percent by year‑end if the pattern of past levies holds, Goldman Sachs economists said in a note this week. Businesses have so far carried around 64 percent of the costs, and foreign exporters about 14 percent, according to the analysis led by Jan Hatzius. By December, Goldman expects businesses’ share to fall below 10 percent and foreign exporters’ share to rise to 25 percent. The bank projects the shift will lift core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation—a key Federal Reserve gauge—to 3.2 percent in December versus 2.4 percent without tariff effects. In June, core PCE inflation came in at 2.8 percent. * * * With a new boss looming at The BLS, one wonders what the 'old boss' has in hand for today's CPI data (with consensus seeing both headline and core YoY price changes ticking higher) after June's consumer prices came in cooler than expected, disappointing the Trump Tariff Tantrum crowd. Will this time be different... Will the dreaded tariff-flation show up this time? Headline CPI rose 0.2% MoM in July (as expected) and +2.7% YoY (cooler than the 2.8% expected) and in line with the June print... Source: Bloomberg Headline CPI rose 0.2%, after rising 0.3% in June. CPI Core rose 0.3% in July, following a 0.2% increase in June. Indexes that increased over the month include medical care, airline fares, recreation, household furnishings and operations, and used cars and trucks. The indexes for lodging away from home and communication were among the few major indexes that decreased in July. Core CPI rose 0.3% MoM (as expected) but YoY rose 3.1% (hotter than the 3.0% expected) - the highest since February... Source: Bloomberg Under the hood, Fuel Oil and Transportation costs rose the most but Gasoline and Food at Home costs fell MoM... Core CPI MoM Details: The shelter index increased 0.2 percent over the month. The index for owners’ equivalent rent rose 0.3 percent in July as did the index for rent. Conversely, the lodging away from home index fell 1.0 percent in July. The medical care index increased 0.7 percent over the month, following a 0.5-percent increase in June. The index for dental services increased 2.6 percent in July and the index for hospital and related services increased 0.4 percent. The physicians’ services index rose 0.2 percent over the month, while the prescription drugs index fell 0.2 percent. The index for airline fares increased 4.0 percent over the month, after declining 0.1 percent in June. The recreation index increased 0.4 percent over the month, as did the household furnishings and operations index. The index for used cars and trucks rose 0.5 percent in July and the index for personal care rose 0.4 percent. The new vehicles index was unchanged over the month while the communication index fell 0.3 percent. Annual changes: The shelter index increased 3.7 percent over the last year. Other indexes with notable increases over the last year include medical care (+3.5 percent), household furnishings and operations (+3.4 percent), motor vehicle insurance (+5.3 percent), and recreation (+2.4 percent). Goods inflation is accelerating (some will argue 'tariffs', some will argue fuel) while Services inflation has stabilized... Source: Bloomberg The latest inflation report continues to show no negative impact from tariffs. Core goods prices were up 0.2% in July. They are up just 1.1% over the past 12 months and are actually up a lesser 0.8% since President Trump began phasing in tariffs. — Joseph Lavorgna (@Lavorgnanomics) August 12, 2025 There is one problem in the data... SuperCore CPI (Services ex-Shelter) rose 0.55% MoM (hottest since January) and up 3.59% YoY (hottest since February)... Source: Bloomberg The jump in Transportation costs and Medical Care Services stood out for SuperCore (neither seem like they are affected in any way by tariffs)... 3m and 6m annualized CPI is also refusing to bow to the terror predicted by Trump tariff haters... So, not exactly the screaming spike in prices that Democrats interviewed by UMich have hallucinated about? It is worth noting that 32% of the inputs for CPI are now 'imputed' using the un-preferred \"different cell\" method... Different cell imputation expands the search to include prices for similar items or prices in a broader geographic area. While different cell imputation does not introduce bias, it can lead to greater volatility in the CPI data. Tiffany Wilding, Pimco economist, tells Bloomberg TV that tariff-related pressures are contained within certain areas of the report: “It’s very concentrated within goods, it’s happening slowly, and outside of that, inflationary pressures look very manageable. So I think for a Federal Reserve, that is a very good sign.” Art Hogan, B. Riley Wealth chief market strategist, weighs in: “Core goods are the real driver of the move up in the index, while being somewhat offset by energy and shelter cost. The report will likely not change the path forward for the Fed, as we expect to see rate cuts at the next three meetings.” Rate-cut expectations rose after the CPI print with September now trading at 95%... But there is a silver lining... The new BLS commissioner will not be fired today — zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 12, 2025 So, Airfares, Dental Care, Auto Insurance, Medical Care, and Rent were among the biggest drivers of upside in CPI... NONE of which have ANYTHING to do with tariffs (even if you squint) And tariff-related items such as New Cars, Apparel, and Toys barely budged. And cue the \"just wait until next month\" arguments!!... Liesman: \"I don't want to rain on the market's parade here\" Kernen: \"You do\" — zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 12, 2025 Tyler Durden Tue, 08/12/2025 - 14:11",

    "fullContent": "DoT Makes DEI Revisions In EV Charging Infrastructure Funding Rules Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled revised guidance for an electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure federal funding program, removing several diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requirements, the Department of Transportation (DOT) said in an Aug. 11 statement. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program had allocated $5 billion to states for developing an interconnected network of fast chargers across the United States. NEVI was part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), with the program a key aspect of the Biden administration’s push to make America reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The program mandates that states submit plans detailing how they intend to use the federal funds. The Interim Final Guidance issued by Duffy on Monday, and effective immediately, rescinds many DEI policies included in the program. For instance, a requirement that state plans ensure the deployment and operation of EV charging infrastructure achieve equitable and fair distribution of benefits and services has been removed, DOT said. Another requirement, according to which projects under NEVI target at least 40 percent of the benefits toward disadvantaged communities, has been rescinded, it added. States were earlier asked to ensure that NEVI implementation creates opportunities for minority-owned and women-owned small businesses. This has now been revoked. As Naveen Athrappully details below for The Epoch Times, the update “eliminates requirements for states to address consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience, and terrain considerations,” said the DOT. It minimizes the need for states to consider electric grid integration and renewable energy in their plans, simplifies the approval process, and accelerates project deliveries. The revised guidance for NEVI will ensure that “charging stations are actually built, and federal funding is spent effectively and efficiently,” DOT said. According to a July 22 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the IIJA had set aside $7.5 billion for NEVI and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program (CFI) combined, to support development of public EV charging infrastructure. However, as of April 2025, only 384 charging ports had been built nationwide under these initiatives, the report stated. In its Aug. 11 statement, DOT said that the NEVI program was “established to fund States’ deployment of EV charging infrastructure, but Biden and [Pete] Buttigieg added requirements that were difficult to understand and implement.” Buttigieg was the secretary of transportation under the Biden administration. “The Biden-Buttigieg Administration wasted time, money, and public trust in implementing the program,” the DOT statement said. “The updates streamline applications, provide states with more flexibility, and slash red tape.” DOT said the new guidance was in line with President Donald Trump’s Jan 30 executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy.” In the order, Trump criticized “burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations” in recent years that have impeded the development of America’s abundant energy and natural resources. The Transportation Department said the NEVI program is being aligned with “the Trump Administration’s priorities of safety, efficiency, and innovation,” the statement said. Legality of Funding Cancelation DOT’s revised guidance for NEVI funding follows the department’s suspension of funds for the program in February, which had faced criticism and legal challenges. In a Feb. 6 letter sent to state departments of transportation, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)—an agency under DOT—informed them that it was suspending the commitment of NEVI funds. A May 22 GAO report criticized the decision, arguing that DOT violated regulations in canceling the funding. “DOT is not authorized to withhold these funds from expenditure, and DOT must continue to carry out the statutory requirements of the program,” the report said. In May, a coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration over its suspension of NEVI funding. The lawsuit accused the termination of violating several regulations, including the Administrative Procedure Act and the Separation of Powers Doctrine. In a June 24 ruling, District Judge Tana Lin of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington granted a preliminary injunction barring DOT from withholding funding. Lin ruled that DOT “attempted to override the express will of Congress” and overstepped its constitutional authority by withholding funding that was already approved by Congress. Under the preliminary injunction, DOT was asked to release NEVI funds to 14 states. In its Aug. 11 statement, DOT said that when Duffy and FHWA launched a review of NEVI earlier this year, 84 percent of the program’s funds were still unobligated, which it said was a “clear signal” of the initiative’s failure. “If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy said. “The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure. While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’s will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.” Tyler Durden Tue, 08/12/2025 - 14:00",
