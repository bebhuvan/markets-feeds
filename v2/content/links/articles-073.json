    "summary": "The Census Bureau released the Residential Vacancies and Homeownership report for Q2 2025 today. The results of this survey were significantly distorted by the pandemic in 2020. This report is frequently mentioned by analysts and the media to track household formation, the homeownership rate, and the homeowner and rental vacancy rates.  However, there are serious questions about the accuracy of this survey. This survey might show the trend, but I wouldn't rely on the absolute numbers. Analysts probably shouldn't use the HVS to estimate the excess vacant supply or household formation, or rely on the homeownership rate, except as a guide to the trend. National vacancy rates in the second quarter 2025 were 7.0 percent for rental housing and 1.1 percent for homeowner housing. The rental vacancy rate was higher than the rate in the second quarter 2024 (6.6 percent) and not statistically different from the rate in the first quarter 2025 (7.1 percent). The homeowner vacancy rate of 1.1 percen",

Below are the YoY% changes in real spending on services (dark blue) vs. real retail sales (light blue), which covers about 50% of the same territory. On a YoY basis as of the last report real retail sales was up 1% and real spending on goods up 3%; the below graph norms those to the zero line:Now let’s look at the same series, identically normed to 0, since the 1990s:Real spending has typically been this tepid YoY going in to recessi",

Thematic investing is presented in a model framework in the new paper, \"Thematic Investing: A Risk-based Perspective\". In the paper, the authors cite several definitions: “Themes are structural trends expected to significantly impact economies and redefine business models.” .... “Thematic investing can be seen as an additional dimension in portfolios.” and  “.... themes may pertain to macroeconomic or structural trends that transcend the traditional business cycle.” More formally, their model looks at the residuals for a set of assets. Cross-sectionally, these residuals should be uncorrelated after accounting for their main factors. In the case of a theme, there should be positive pairwise correlation across the set of assets identified in a theme. There is a relationship that cannot be accounted for by other known factors.
