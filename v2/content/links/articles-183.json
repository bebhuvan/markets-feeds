    "fullContent": "Trump Admin Unveils Rule 'To Unleash American Drone Dominance' Authored by Jackson Richman via The Epoch Times, The Trump administration has announced a proposed rule on drones aimed at stimulating the U.S. drone market. “We are going to unleash American drone dominance,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at an Aug. 5 press conference. Duffy noted that China dominates drones with 90 percent control of the market. “We’re turning over our skies to one of our main adversaries,” he said. The new rule would allow people to get products such as a Starbucks cup of coffee via drone, he said, adding that it will also change energy production, farming, manufacturing, and filmmaking. This regulation deals with drones being flown beyond the visual line of sight. It will be open to public comment for 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. “Operators in the past would have to get individual waivers to operate these drones, very complicated. They were issued on a case-by-case basis, and because of that complication, I don’t think we saw the innovation that we should have in America,” Duffy said. “We are going to eliminate that prior process, and the approval will be done in a far different way. The rules are going to completely change the way that drone use is going to be approved, and what this is going to do is, again, allow our innovators and businesses to continue to create and innovate and change the way our industry works with the use of these drones.” Under the regulation, commercial drones would operate at under 400 feet above ground, and operators would need Federal Aviation Administration approval to fly them in certain airspaces. The drones can weigh up to 1,320 pounds, including what they’re carrying. The proposed regulation was developed under an executive order that President Donald Trump signed on June 6 titled “Unleashing American Drone Dominance.” “The United States must accelerate the safe commercialization of drone technologies and fully integrate UAS into the National Airspace System,” it stated. “The time has come to accelerate testing and to enable routine drone operations, scale up domestic production, and expand the export of trusted, American-manufactured drone technologies to global markets. “Building a strong and secure domestic drone sector is vital to reducing reliance on foreign sources, strengthening critical supply chains, and ensuring that the benefits of this technology are delivered to the American people.” The rule would also require operators to address security risks, such as protecting drones from intentional electronic interference.

    "fullContent": "Texas Deputy Threatens To Ticket \"Everyone\" Because She Didn't Get Laid The Night Prior A Texas deputy is learning the hard way that TikTok clout doesn’t mix well with police work—especially when your viral joke involves ticketing everyone because you “didn’t get cracked last night.” The now-deleted video featured Harris County Precinct 5 Deputy Jennifer Escalera in full uniform, scribbling on a notepad, with the caption: “Didn’t get cracked last night so everyone is getting a ticket.” She blurred parts of her uniform but left her nametag clearly visible—because nothing says “low-profile investigation” like tagging yourself in your own controversy., according to the NY Post. The constable’s office was not amused. “Our administration is aware and internal affairs has opened an investigation. We have no other comment at this time,” they told Fox 26. Translation: please stop sending us screenshots of her TikTok. The Post writes that Escalera, sworn in back in September 2021, has a TikTok history filled with uniformed posts, sometimes about the balancing act of being a cop and a mom. In one video she’s seen getting ready for work with the text: “contemplating if I really need this job, knowing that I do.” After this week, she might be contemplating it even harder. Local residents weren’t impressed with her attempt at humor. “I think it’s really inappropriate and disrespectful,” said Alex Fitch, who added, “It makes them look unprofessional when they start posting videos like that. You can’t take them seriously… Then they wonder why, when you see them, they say, ‘Why don’t you respect me?’ Well, you don’t treat yourself like a woman, and you ain’t treating yourself like a police officer.” \"I feel like they're playing. They're childish. They ain't taking nothing serious. You gon write me a ticket because you ain't get cracked? That's crazy, but that's the society and world we live in today,\" one resident said to Fox 26. In other words: less thirst-trapping TikTok, more traffic safety.

    "fullContent": "Ghislaine Maxwell Reportedly Cleared Trump's Name In DOJ Interview Authored by Ken Silva via Headline USA, Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly told the Justice Department in a recent interview that she never observed President Donald Trump doing anything around her that “caused concern.” Maxwell was recently interviewed by the DOJ about roughly 100 people who were associated with her and her accomplice, deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. “Maxwell said nothing during the interview that would be harmful to President Donald Trump,” ABC reported, citing anonymous sources. “There is also an audio recording of the interview, the sources said, but it’s not clear whether the administration plans to release the audio to accompany any public release of the transcript,” the outlet added. “The public release of the transcripts could come as soon as this week.” Maxwell was moved from federal prison in Florida to a cushier, lower-security camp in Texas after her DOJ interview. Maxwell was previously housed in the “honor dorm” of a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida. “Maxwell’s cushy new digs in D South – the so-called ‘honor dorm’ – are reserved for 30 to 40 of the low-security Florida lockup’s best-behaved prisoners,” the Daily Mail reported in March 2024. She has an appeal pending before the Supreme Court, and rumors are swirling that President Donald Trump may pardon her in exchange for information about his political enemies. A potential pardon would give Maxwell every incentive to clear Trump’s name - which is what she did, according to a Wednesday report from ABC News. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 17:00",

    "fullContent": "Howard Stern's SiriusXM Show In Dire Straits As $500M Contract Nears End Howard Stern was the undisputed king of U.S. media throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. But somewhere along the way, he squandered his status and morphed into a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, proudly proclaiming, I am a woke motherfucker.\" That was the inflection point, where he lost not just the narrative but also ratings. His once-massive audience evaporated, and now a new report suggests Stern's future at SiriusXM remains highly uncertain. Insiders confirm to the Daily Mail that Howard Stern's long-running SiriusXM radio show is in dire straits, with his $500 million, five-year contract winding down. The odds of SiriusXM renewing a long-term deal appear grim, as the radio host's negotiators are now pushing for a short-term agreement. \"He may do a one- to two-year contract if they can meet him where he wants financially. He doesn't want to pull the plug on his employees like this,\" one source told the Daily Mail. Another source said, \"He is off in the summer but this year has been saying 'Maybe I should retire.'\" At his absolute peak, Stern's morning show was syndicated in over 60 markets, reaching tens of millions of listeners daily. By 2006, he jumped to SiriusXM in an unheard-of $500 million deal, ushering in a new era of subscription-based, uncensored audio content. However, over time, Stern lost the plot and fell into the abyss by becoming an unhinged mouthpiece for the Democratic Party.... A new case of go woke, go broke: Howard Stern’s going to be cancelled at SiriusXM when his contract ends. In recent years Stern said he hates Trump voters, that he thinks we’re stupid and that he would deny unvaccinated people hospital care if it was up to him.

Stern has ceded his cultural media news crown to newer voices in the podcast and streaming world, most notably Joe Rogan. The report comes just weeks after CBS canceled Stephen Colbert's \"Late Show,\" joining a growing list of left-leaning media figures, like CNN's Don Lemon and MSNBC's Joy Reid, who have been kicked to the curb by their respective networks for abysmal ratings.

    "fullContent": "As America Soul-Searches, The Rest Of The West Is Falling Apart Authored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.us In terms of geopolitics one could argue that allies don’t have to like each other, they just have to provide a mutual benefit that serves the greater purposes of peace. One could also argue that through cultural exchange the good habits of one country could easily influence the bad habits of another, but that kind of influence can also happen in reverse. Though we might think of American culture as the content driver of the planet, the reality is that our ideals are an exceedingly rare dynamic found in no other society. We provide sanctuary to a fragile ember of free thought in an otherwise gloomy world of globalist oppression. It is something that must be protected at all costs. Over the years I’ve heard many arguments from ignorant liberals about the grand progressive accomplishments of the European experiment and its centralized system. I’ve been told many times about how much safer Canada and Australia are. How the UK has near zero gun crime and how socialism works so well in Norway and Sweden. Leftists in the US have long embraced this messaging as gospel and for generations they have told us that we MUST join the rest of western civilization by sacrificing certain liberties for the sake of future generations. We must become more like our allies in “more civilized” and liberal nations, or be left behind and labeled an “embarrassment”. In reality, progressive leaders have abandoned western civilization, forsaking it in exchange for the elitist “Great Reset”. The political landscape in the UK, Canada and Australia has turned decidedly sour. They are speed running into technocracy and communism and abandoning any semblance of “democratic” governance. The mask is coming off to reveal Orwell’s “Big Brother”. Europe Is Now A Third World Cesspool Western civilization has been a net positive for humanity over the centuries and the only people that deny this are those that don’t know history and those that refuse to look at what is happening in the EU today with any honesty. When you truly study the history of third-world societies you will find that life in these environments is brutal, devoid of compassion and bereft of freedom. The majority of their conflicts are solved with violence, often to the point of barbarism. No woke liberal today stands a chance living within these societies. They would be laughed at over their calls for “equity” and slaughtered for their activism. Yet, leftists aggressively lobby for open borders so the third-world can invade. It’s important to understand that Multiculturalism is a weaponized ideology. It’s not about coexistence, or labor markets, or population decline; it’s about eliminating western culture. The goal of globalists is to destabilize the connective tissue of the west, to saturate and dilute our shared cultural principles and make us as weak as possible. They hope to use migrants as enforcers. It’s a classic strategy implemented by many tyrannical regimes that prefer to recruit foreign mercenaries as leverage to control an otherwise rebellious peasantry. Third world migrants are creating an atmosphere of crime and decay that globalists think will terrorize native Europeans into submission and apathy. If you’re afraid to walk the streets of your own country, then your country no longer belongs to you. The Muslim/Leftist Alliance It’s no coincidence that the EU is importing migrants primarily from Islamic societies: They have no intention of integrating and they openly brag about how they’re coming to Europe to plunder and conquer. As these groups enter the west they bring with them a philosophy of exploitation – Their religious rules only apply to believers; non-believers are fair game and can be freely targeted. One might wonder how an alliance between the leftists and the Muslims is even possible. They seem to be diametrically opposed to each other on almost everything. But consider for a moment what they share: A parallel hatred of western civilization and a desire to destroy it. Muslims see atheist progressives as disgusting, but they also see them as useful for opening the gates to predominantly Christian nations. Leftists, being generally weak and unable to project physical power, see Muslims as much needed hired muscle. This relationship is made obvious in Britain where Muslim gangs are able to roam the streets brandishing knives and machetes with impunity while British patriots are consistently targeted by the government for censorship and intimidation. It’s no secret that the champagne socialist leaders of the UK want to eliminate the patriot threat and they see Muslim migrants as an effective tool. If patriots fight back, they are simply labeled as “racists” and thrown in prison. The government and the migrants operate as a team. There is a growing counter-movement among British conservatives (real conservatives, not party conservatives) to turn the tide, but I have my doubts. Marches provide visibility, but not necessarily change. It might take a civil war to enact the reforms required to save the UK. Canada Shakes Hands With Beelzebub My relationship to centralized religious institutions is complicated but I am thoroughly convinced that key elements of Christianity are ideals that best represent the western world – Our values of hard work, meritocracy, independence, self improvement, freedom, charity, and moral compass are rooted in the Christian tradition. Western civilization cannot exist without the fundamentals of Christian doctrine. Remove those fundamentals, and the west will collapse. Moderate liberals cannot keep the west going, their vision is superficial and devoid of soul. One thing that pushes me ever closer to Christianity is the fact that leftists and globalists are so keenly preoccupied with crushing it. I used to think that the globalist agenda was mostly concerned with whittling down personal freedom, but after 20 years of observing their schemes and propaganda it’s clear to me that freedom is a secondary issue. Instead, the globalists are focused intensely on creating a world in which Christians cannot exist while playing hands-off with every other religion and ideology. It suggests that Christianity is a specific threat to them. Case in point: In Montreal last week an American Christian singer by the name of Sean Feucht was set to hold a small concert, but had his permit for the event revoked by city officials. They stated that they were preventing the show because the content “runs counter to the values of inclusion, solidarity, and respect that are championed in Montreal.” This was just one of six Christian shows that Canadian politicians tried to cancel. They accused Fuecht of promoting “hate”, and the Canadian government is taking actions to remove religious exemptions from existing hate speech laws. This was the goal of hate legislation all along. No official in Canada is trying to shut down Muslim events; they are singling out Christians with censorship. Feucht decided to hold the concert in a local church instead, which triggered a bizarre series of incidents. Local police tried to disrupt the concert and demanded Feutch produce a permit which they knew he didn’t have. Antifa and LGBT activists showed up to harass concert goers and one of them threw smoke bombs into the church. They then threatened the singer with fines and arrest. The media attacked him for not having a permit to which he stated: “You don’t need a permit to sing in a church.” The church has since been fined $2500 for hosting the show. Keep in mind that the Canadian government has been flooding the country with Muslim migrants over the past ten years and is allowing them extreme latitude to run their own communities. There has been no government effort to silence the anti-LGBT rhetoric of Islamic speakers. Canada has been quickly sinking into authoritarianism with draconian censorship laws and woke indoctrination. The Carney government is currently implementing a mass gun ban with over 300 models of firearms abruptly prohibited. Conservative Canadians in provinces like Alberta believe that the Carney government is trying to disarm them to prevent secession, a serious possibility under the current conditions. Our conservative brothers to the north have a difficult path ahead of them. The legal changes in Canada will leave the US as the only nation left in the west with widespread civilian gun ownership, not to mention the only nation left with legitimate free speech rights. America Soul Searches At The Edge Of The “Great Reset” Incrementally, the majority of the western world has been turned into a pit of dystopian despair. Australia, for now, is the only region not burying their population in hostile migrants but it’s enforcing all of the same speech and thought control laws. The US is the only country trying to reverse course, but our soul searching is, frankly, too slow. The defeat of woke doctrine in the US is certainly a relief. Clearly most Americans are done with deconstructionism and liberal mental illness. Most people hate leftists and want nothing to do with them. However, there is a deep divide among populists, from conservatives to libertarians to moderates. Their isn’t a strong bond except for our opposition to wokeness, and this is a problem. Loving freedom is not enough. Having a shared enemy is not enough. There needs to be more for a society to survive and thrive. There needs to be a greater purpose. In the meantime, we still have millions of illegal migrants to deal with as well as a small army of unhinged woke militants that are roaming the streets when they should be locked up in padded rooms. The will to take necessary action is limited by a refusal among many people to accept that we are alone, and we are at war. There are millions of patriots in the EU, the UK, Australia and Canada that want to join the fight. We’ll have to wait and see if their civil disobedience bears fruit. I believe that they are waiting for us to make a move. They’re hoping we spark a greater rebellion against globalism. This requires that we clean our own house first and rediscover the unifying ideals that make the west something worth fighting for. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 16:20",

    "fullContent": "Lies, Damn Lies, And Statistics Authored by Eric Salzman via Racket News, When I was told Friday that President Trump fired the BLS commissioner due to a poor July payroll report (a less-than-expected monthly job add of 73,000 and very large negative two-month revision of 258,000), I waited for a laugh track that never came. He did what? Really? I spent most of the weekend shaking my head and laughing that the president would fire BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer for a lousy Non-Farm Payroll report. Then I thought about it a bit more. Most of us who have been in the markets have probably spent at least six of the 12 first Fridays of the month every year scratching our heads when the monthly report is released. Our staff economist leads us through the various seasonal adjustments, model adjustments, survey participation rates, data revisions to the last two reports and other assorted “kinks” in the reporting, and by the end it usually sounds like nonsense. I believe these monthly reports warrant a good dose of skepticism. Year-over-year however, I always thought the numbers were relatively accurate, which is why I was pretty surprised when in February the BLS revised the total 2024 non-farm payroll employment level down 598,000, a revision of −0.4%. That’s the largest revision in 10 years. Annual benchmark revisions have averaged 0.1% in the last decade, ranging from less than .05% to 0.3%. Trump already had his suspicions back in August 2024 when the BLS estimated that the 2024 revision would be a whopping 818,000 fewer jobs than previously reported. A big negative revision for 2024 annual job creation meant that his Democratic opponent had been campaigning on inflated employment numbers. While it was probably just poor data, as Racket’s Matt Taibbi has been tirelessly reporting, the president has a very justified “trust issue” with other supposedly non-partisan organs of government, so why not the BLS as well? It has not been a good decade for the BLS in the “trust” department. In 2022, BLS investigated a suspicious event and found it did nothing wrong. Then, in 2024, senior BLS officials blatantly lied about a release of material nonpublic information to a select group of people. “Super Users” The New York Times reported that in January 2024 a BLS staff economist engaged in highly inappropriate communication revealing material nonpublic information to a select group of banks and hedge funds. From the Times: In an email addressed to “Super Users,” the economist explained a technical change in the calculation of the housing figures. Then, departing from the bureaucratic language typically used by statistical agencies, he added, “All of you searching for the source of the divergence have found it.” To the inflation obsessives who received the email — and other forecasters who quickly heard about it — the implication was clear: The pop in housing prices in January might have been not a fluke but rather a result of a shift in methodology that could keep inflation elevated longer than economists and Federal Reserve officials had expected. That could, in turn, make the Fed more cautious about cutting interest rates. That kind of information had tremendous value in the wrong hands. There was an uproar when news of the Super User group leaked. When confronted in early March 2024 by news outlets, the BLS called what happened a mistake and denied there was an actual “Super Users” group, but rather a one time reply to multiple inquiries. From Bloomberg News: “To expedite a response, the employee blind-copied a number of requesters and referred to them as super users — this was a mistake,” said Jeffrey Hill, a BLS associate commissioner. The New York Times filed a FOIA with BLS, and found there was indeed a “Super User” list, kept by at least one “low ranking” staff economist who was communicating with a number of banks, money managers and hedge funds. The emails show that the employee did engage in extended, one-on-one email exchanges with data users about how the inflation figures are put together. Such details, though highly technical, can be of significant interest to forecasters, who compete to predict inflation figures to hundredths of a percentage point. Those estimates, in turn, are used by investors making bets on the huge batches of securities that are tied to inflation or interest rates. In at least one case, emails to super users appear to have shared methodological details that were not yet public. On Jan. 31, the employee sent an email to his super users describing coming changes to the way the agency calculates used car prices, at the time a crucial issue for inflation watchers. The email included a three-page document providing detailed answers to questions about the change, and a spreadsheet showing how they would affect calculations. “Thank you all for your very difficult, challenging and thoughtful questions,” the email said. “It is your questions that help us flesh out all the potential problems.” The questions also seemed to have fleshed out for the Super Users important changes to how the BLS was changing their calculations of the CPI two weeks before their official release in mid-February! The Times identified several “Super Users.” Among them: Barclays, Nomura, BNP Paribas, Millennium Capital Partners, Breven Howard and Citadel. Bloomberg News, after reviewing the documents, found JP Morgan, BlackRock and Moore Capital were also part of the group. In response, an external team of experts was formed to investigate the incidents and suggest improvements. While the team’s report stated that “none of the incidents were related to the quality or accuracy of the agency's core data work,” the issue of the Super User group had nothing to do with the quality of the agency’s work. Rather, it had to do with disseminating that work to a select group before it was made public. Here is what McEntarfer had to say about the Super User incident: It was an idiosyncratically collected group of emails of people who had been asking him questions that he put together against policies and procedures that BLS outlined, so, yeah, it was limited to one person and ceased at the moment its attention was brought to the agency. Idiosyncratically collected group of emails? I have to give McEntarfer credit for some fantastic, institutionalized bullshit there! How many times did this “idiosyncratic” behavior take place, who did it take place with, and what was discussed in each of these idiosyncratic exchanges? What did the members of the Super User group do with the information that they knew was material and non-public? Why did the employee provide this service? Regarding the expert report, the McEntarger concluded: I want to emphasize that throughout their conversations with me, the team emphasized that overall, their investigation revealed a really excellent organization with a highly capable staff, deeply committed to their mission and their agency,\" Nothing to see here, please move along You might remember that back in 2022, inflation was raging. On the morning of December 13, 2022, the markets were on pins and needles waiting for the 8:30 a.m. November Consumer Price Index report. About one minute before the release, 10-year U.S. Treasury Futures began to skyrocket, along with equity futures. At 8:30 the BLS reported that inflation for November came in much lower than expected, something that would have caused bond and equity futures to surge higher, like they did 60 seconds prior to the release! The March 2023 Ten-Year Treasury futures saw the buying of 13,000 contracts seconds before the release, a notional value of nearly $1.5 billion. Interestingly, while there was much hand-wringing, the incident passed without any investigation. This was a bit “disconcerting” since the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) could have discovered who traded right before 8:30 a.m. The CFTC could have rounded up all the Futures Clearing Merchants and had them divulge which clients placed the trades. It might have taken subpoenas and some investigative work, but the government has folks who do that sort of thing. As far as we know, this was never done, or at least disclosed. Hilariously, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre contorted herself into a pretzel later in the afternoon, essentially telling the press it was no big deal and if it was, the White House wasn’t the leaker! The Labor Department conducted an initial investigation as to whether the data was hacked and dismissed the possibility of a data leak. The BLS denied any awareness of an early release of the data. Not exactly The Inquisition! What is true is the report got into the wrong hands at the wrong time. Either somebody at BLS leaked the report, or it was a very senior official from either the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, or the president and/or his senior economic advisors. The odds point to the former. Either way the BLS seemed to want no part in finding out the answer to this mystery. Personally, I don’t think that the July Non-Farm Payroll report was rigged. However, I do think the BLS has a credibility problem, which unfortunately extends beyond its statistical acumen. Once the lying and potential covering up begins, credibility is shot. There has been much talk this week about how casting doubt on our economic data is another blow to democracy. Interestingly, I have not seen any mention of either the “Super User” or the December 13, 2022, scandals in the reporting. The timing and optics of Commissioner McEntarfer’s firing could have been much better, but it’s past time to clean house at the BLS. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 15:45",
