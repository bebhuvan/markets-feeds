In this episode, we delve into critical questions based on recent data: 1. What factors contribute to net household financial savings reaching a 50-year low of 5%? 2. How does India's household debt, at 34% of income (excluding home loans), fit into the broader economic picture? 3. Despite a significant increase in demat accounts, why has the base of income taxpayers remained consistent? 4. What implications does the rise of AI hold for affluent individuals?
