    "fullContent": "Florida Highway Horror: Migrant Truck Driver Leaves 3 Americans Dead Amid CDL Crisis Submitted by American Truckers United, In yet another tragic incident underscoring the dangers on America's highways, a Punjabi migrant truck driver allegedly executed an illegal U-turn on Florida's Turnpike near Fort Pierce on August 12, resulting in a catastrophic collision that killed three innocent Americans. The semi-truck, attempting the prohibited maneuver in an \"official use only\" area, was struck by a minivan carrying a 30-year-old driver from Pompano Beach and his passengers‚Äîa 37-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man from Miami. All three perished, with two dying at the scene and the driver succumbing later in the hospital. Video footage captured the horrifying moment, showing the 18-wheeler blocking lanes and causing the fatal impact. The driver, reportedly an Indian migrant suspected of being part of a California Eco-System that exploits cheap labor, walked away uninjured. This crash mirrors a disturbing trend we've repeatedly highlighted: untrained migrant drivers flooding U.S. highways, leading to preventable deaths. As American Truckers United has warned in previous reports, the Biden-era surge in foreign and non-domiciled CDLs has turned interstates into killing fields. From the deadly pileups in Austin, Terrell, Thomasville, and Chattanooga involving suspected non-citizen truckers, to cargo thefts by \"ghost carriers,\" these incidents are no coincidence. We've urged Transportation Secretary Duffy to ban CDLs issued to non-citizens and probe these threats, but inaction persists amid record migrant influxes into the industry. This Florida tragedy, involving a California-based trucking profile from this cheap labor ecosystem, fits the exact mold: reckless actions by undertrained foreigners endangering American lives. Multilingual signs at Walmart and Amazon depots signal the scale, yet mom-and-pop U.S. truckers face bankruptcy while migrants fuel fraud and fatalities.\" For the edification of the group, here are the most common last names of trucking companies started since 2018. pic.twitter.com/IPz80w3H30 ‚Äî may be danielle üíªüöõüá∫üá∏ (@maybedanielleee) August 16, 2025 How many more Americans must die before we secure our highways? American Truckers United demands immediate federal intervention to halt this national security nightmare.

    "fullContent": "Watch: Hellfire Missile Launcher Hidden Inside Civilian Box Truck Concealing missile and rocket artillery launchers, or even swarms of kamikaze drones, inside civilian-style trucks and shipping containers fits directly into next-generation warfare, especially under the umbrella of deception and the ability to distribute lethality in plain sight. The latest setup to pique our interest is a truck-mounted launch system for AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, developed by the 209th Arsenal, a production facility within Taiwan's Armaments Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense. According to military blog The War Zone, the twin-rail Hellfire launcher inside the bed of a box truck has a roof-mounted sensor mast that carries a small radar and an electro-optical/infrared sensor turret. The system can fire laser-guided Hellfires and radar-guided AGM-114L Longbows. Video of the box truck with missiles in the rear first appeared on the Military News Agency's YouTube page on Thursday, in a short feature from Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense showcasing the latest military technology. TWZ noted, \"Missile and rocket artillery launchers hidden in plain sight inside civilian-style trucks, as well as unassuming shipping containers, have become something of a trend globally in recent years. China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and even the United States have all been developing and/or fielding systems that fall into these categories,\" adding, \"Terrorists and other non-state actors have also employed improvised concealed launch systems over the years.\" Which brings us to the other side of the world, where Ukraine recently launched a brazen drone swarm attack deep inside Russia using shipping containers packed with armed drones. These containers were hidden in plain sight, allowing the drones, armed with mini warheads, to penetrate far into Russian territory and strike Moscow's fleet of long-range bombers, damaging several. We found a warehouse where containers with drones were collected. Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk tract 28A. It was rented for 350,000 rubles. That's why the truck in the Amur region had Chelyabinsk license plates - they were leaving from there. pic.twitter.com/rf5DJy8RDa ‚Äî Elizaveta Igorevna üá∑üá∫ üá∑üá∫ (@ElisaIgorevna) June 1, 2025 Ukraine just mounted an attack that marks a turning point in the history of warfare Hundreds of drones were pre-deployed and then struck 40+ aircraft 1000+ km inside of Russia $1B in damage by Critical infra is no longer safepic.twitter.com/qaPS3oKD1Y ‚Äî Shaun Maguire (@shaunmmaguire) June 1, 2025 The bigger picture here is that militaries are disguising weapon systems as ordinary vehicles, shipping containers, and likely other in-plain-sight platforms that can bypass traditional countermeasures.

    "fullContent": "Boiled Frogs: AI Slop, Phishing, Deep-Fakes, & Spam, Spam, Spam Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog, We're frogs in a pot that's being heated so gradually that we no longer notice the sewage is extinguishing the utility of the Web. Let's take \"Show me the incentives, and I'll show you the outcome\" and direct it on the Internet, the digital realm that is now central to modern life The incentives are making money from attention, i.e. clicks, engagement, etc. by any means available, and a burgeoning universe of cons, deception, extortion and fraud. And with those incentives, the outcome is an ever-expanding river of toxic sewage, a river of AI slop, deep-fakes, phishing, clickbait and spam, spam, spam on every device, every platform, every screen. This is not inconsequential. A physician-correspondent recently reported that he was researching a cardiovascular condition online and realized the article he was reviewing was AI slop, a conglomeration of inaccurate diagrams and plausible-sounding nonsense slapped together to get whatever meager income would be generated by a modest number of views. That's the incentive the Big Tech platforms set up: since it's a low-odds gamble that any post will go viral on a large enough scale to make serious income, the incentive is to post 1,000 AI slop posts which each collect 1,000 views. In other words, make it up on volume. Since the Internet is global, people in low-income nations have an incentive to generate AI slop to earn what is a pittance in developed nations. The barrier to entry is low--anyone can produce veritable mountains of AI slop with free tools and low-cost bandwidth--and the gains, however modest, are welcome if paid work is scarce. The same \"make it up on volume\" approach incentivizes churning out millions of phishing and spam SMS, emails and posts on every platform under the sun. If there's only one sucker per 10,000 entreaties, then send out 10 million. Since views and engagement generate income, the more outrageous the clickbait, the better. And of course, the greater the volume of clickbait, the greater the income stream flowing to platforms hosting the clickbait. AI tools incentivize creating deep-fakes of celebrities' voices and personas which can then be deployed to con older Internet users who are often credulous enough to believe that yes, Owen Wilson is talking to me, see, it's him. Every legitimate institution is now a tripwire for phishing and spam. Your USPS package can't be delivered, here's your Social Security Statement, and so on. AI Search is broken, too. I couldn't find the original PropOrNot \"fake-news about fake-news\" list from 2016, and AI search concluded it was not available. Then a correspondent sent me a post on Zero Hedge which prominently displayed the entire original PropOrNot list. (oftwominds.com was on the list, thank you very much.) Washington Post Names Drudge, Zero Hedge, & Ron Paul As Anti-Clinton \"Sophisticated Russian Propaganda Tools\" (November 25, 2016) The burden of shadow work required to delete, unsubscribe and purge our lives of all this sewage is growing heavier by the day. This calls to mind the boiled-frog analogy: we're frogs in a pot that's being heated so gradually that we no longer notice the sewage is extinguishing the utility of the Web. And the reason is--drum roll--that's how everyone makes money: views, engagement, scams, cons, fraud and above all, sheer volume. And who makes money from volume? The Big Tech platforms. So what if it's misleading AI slop, deep-fake scams or clickbait, the more \"engagement\" we get, the more money we make. So where's the incentive to staunch the flood of sewage? There isn't one. The incentive is to shrug and let the user sort it out by burning their own time. If we want a different outcome, we have to change the incentives. * * * Check out my new book Ultra-Processed Life and my updated Books and Films.

    "fullContent": "WoodMac Sounds Alarm On Transformer Shortage Amid AI Data Center Boom The AI data center boom could soon face some serious headwinds, and the problem isn't a shortage of Nvidia GPUs, but America's fragile power grid. A combination of disastrous green policies and soaring data center power demand has already sparked a power bill crisis across the Mid-Atlantic states, while a nationwide grid-tightening crisis unfolds. This has triggered a growing wave of discontent among residents in Maryland and New Jersey, who are angered by Democrats' prioritization of green policies that have retired stable fossil fuel power generation in favor of unreliable solar and wind, resulting in power bill inflation like never seen before. Making matters worse, AI data centers are counting on an upgraded grid to handle new base loads of power. This massive, multi-layered supply chain needed to upgrade the grid spans raw materials, transmission lines, circuit breakers, cables, control systems, and power generation systems. Yet one of the most critical components in that upgrade cycle, transformers, is already in dangerously short supply. A new report from global research and consultancy group Wood Mackenzie highlights that U.S. efforts to upgrade power grids for AI-driven data centers will push transformer demand beyond supply by 30% this year, driving up costs and delaying projects. Analysts warn the shortage will only worsen and persist well into the decade's end. The supply deficit, fueled by AI-related data center growth and broader electrification trends, threatens grid reliability and the whole data center buildout. Viewed as a national security threat, the U.S. production of transformers can't keep pace, meaning about 80% of units will be imported, mostly from South Korea, Mexico, and other countries. \"We have seen such a large increase in power demand,\" said Ben Boucher, a senior analyst of supply chain and data analytics at Wood Mackenzie, adding, \"AI is necessitating data center expansion, which is pushing up electricity usage.\" Just weeks ago, we warned that U.S. transformer wait times have ballooned from 50 to 127 weeks, crippling grid resilience, whether it's upgrading power grids or replacing units damaged by storms, wildfires, or domestic terrorism attacks by radical leftists. In short, the AI data center boom is colliding with a power grid already under strain from failed green policies, surging electricity demand, and a worsening transformer shortage. This is far from ideal in the era of massive data center buildouts, and wait until outrage over skyrocketing power bills goes fully mainstream. We bet that's coming.

    "fullContent": "Sanctions Are Just As Deadly As War: Lancet Study Via The Libertarian Institute Ron Paul, the libertarian leaning former Texas congressman and GOP candidate for president, has always maintained that sanctions are acts of war. The Lancet Global Health recently published a study that proves him right. Economists Mark Weisbrot, Francisco Rodr√≠guez, and Silvio Rend√≥n have found that the yearly total excess human death toll associated with economic sanctions across the world is roughly equivalent to the annual human death tolls of active wars and combat. In fact, the study reveals that on average the civilian deaths caused by sanctions exceed battle-related casualties in kinetic conflicts each year. AFP/Getty Images According to the study, the worst effects on populations across various age groups are caused by unilateral US and EU sanctions against targeted countries. The researchers argue ‚Äúunilateral sanctions imposed by the USA or the EU might be designed in ways that have a greater negative effect on target populations.‚Äù UN sanctions, they add, ‚Äúhave been framed as efforts to minimise their impact on civilian populations, although the extent to which they have achieved this goal remains debated.‚Äù In the period of 2012-2021, for example, the unilateral sanctions‚Äô annual global death toll on average was 564, 258. The study also notes that most of the civilian deaths attributeable to sanctions between 1970 and 2020 were children less than five years old. Economic and unilateral sanctions kill the most vulnerable members of a population including primarily children, the elderly, and the sick. The press release regarding the study, published by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, states ‚ÄúThe researchers studied sanctions‚Äô effects on age-specific mortality rates. They found that children under five made up 51 percent of total deaths due to sanctions over the 1970‚Äì2021 period. Most deaths (77 percent over the same period) were aged 0‚Äì15 and 60‚Äì80.‚Äù The press release continues, ‚ÄúThe study is the first to systematically examine the effects of sanctions on age-specific mortality in cross-country data using methods designed to address causal questions on observational data.‚Äù The researchers conclude that ‚Äúthe effects of sanctions on mortality generally increase over time, with longer-lived sanctions episodes resulting in higher tolls on lives.‚Äù Washington has imposed brutal ‚Äúmaximum pressure‚Äù or ‚Äúcrippling‚Äù sanctions on poor countries across the world such as Venezuela, North Korea, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Cuba. Over the years, it has been documented that these sanctions have contributed to the preventable deaths of tens of thousands and in some cases hundreds of thousands of people in Venezuela and Iraq alone. The US also imposes extensive sanctions regimes on more powerful countries than those listed above such as Russia and Iran. By cutting off the possibility of economic cooperation and interdependence, war has resulted in both cases during the last three years. In 2021, erstwhile Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared that Washington was absolutely committed ‚Äúto [opposing] the reconstruction of Syria‚Äù absent regime change. To that end, the US implemented a callous sanctions regime on Syria using the bipartisan Caesar Act, a law which targeted any person or entity of any nationality that attempted to do business with the war-torn country. These sanctions deliberately targeted the country‚Äôs engineering and construction sectors. As a result, the civilian population was devastated. In 2022, Alena Douhan, a UN special rapporteur on unilateral coercive measures, visited Syria. She explained at the time that the sanctions ‚Äúseverely harm human rights and prevent any efforts for early recovery, rebuilding and reconstruction.‚Äù Douhan stressed that ‚Äú12 million Syrians grapple with food insecurity‚Äù and ‚Äú90% of Syria‚Äôs population currently lives in poverty,‚Äù with limited access to food, shelter, water, electricity, healthcare, heating, cooking, fuel, and transportation. Partly as a result of the bipartisan economic war on Syria, Al Qaeda offshoots were able to seize Damascus and take over the country. Since then, sectarian violence has seen thousands of civilians slaughtered. The use of sanctions, largely spearheaded by the US, has spread across the world over the last several decades. ‚Äú25% of all countries [were] subject to some type of sanctions by either the USA, the EU, or the UN in the 2010‚Äì22 period, by contrast with an average of only 8% in the 1960s.‚Äù Rodr√≠guez insists the entire policy of economic warfare must be reevaluated. ‚ÄúWe have seen economic sanctions ‚Äî especially those imposed by the US ‚Äî contribute substantially to economic collapse in targeted countries, such as Venezuela‚Ä¶ Sanctions often fail to achieve their stated objectives and instead only punish the civilian populations of the targeted countries. It is well past time that the US, EU, and other powerful actors in the international community seriously reconsider this cruel and often counterproductive mechanism.‚Äù Tyler Durden Sat, 08/16/2025 - 10:30",
