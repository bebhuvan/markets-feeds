    "fullContent": "Devastating US Report Lays Bare The Abuses Of 'Settled' Climate Science And Its Role In Net Zero Authored by Chris Morrison via DailyScheptic.org, Net Zero is dead in the United States and the last rites have been administered in the devastating official report from the Department of Energy. Released earlier this week, the report cancels the decades-long censorship imposed by so-called ‘settled’ climate science. It is compiled by five eminent scientists and is a systematic take-down of the claims, methodologies and motivations driving activist scientists, politicians and opinion formers promoting the hard-Left Net Zero fantasy. Despite its ground-breaking importance, to date it has been largely ignored by mainstream media including the BBC and Guardian. Computer models are said to offer “little guidance” on how much of the climate responds to higher levels of carbon dioxide, most extreme weather events are not increasing, sea levels in North America show no increasing trend while weather attribution claims are challenged by natural climate variation along with an admission that they were originally designed with ‘lawfare’ in mind. For Anthony Watts, who has spent decades challenging the ‘settled’ politicised science, the most important consideration is that the report, “directly confronts the exaggerated and politicised rhetoric that has dominated headlines for decades”. Watts, who runs the Watts Up With That? (WUWT?) site that was responsible for publicising the infamous Climategate scandal, argues that the new report is unique in that it has both official status and author independence. It is not a think tank paper or an article in a ‘dissenting’ journal. “It’s rare to see scientists of this calibre (with backgrounds at NASA, IPCC and major universities) allowed to directly challenge prevailing policy narratives with government resources behind them”, he notes. The work is a “comprehensive critique” quoting extensively from peer-reviewed literature with clear explanations of scientific uncertainties and climate model error. For regular readers of WUWT? and other inquiring publications such as the Daily Sceptic, many of the issues discussed in the report will be familiar. In the last four years, your correspondent has written nearly 500 articles on climate science and Net Zero in an attempt to fill in the significant reporting gaps left by the narrative-driven mainstream media. Many of the papers quoted are familiar, not least in the section that deals with the sensational ‘greening’ of the planet caused by higher levels of CO2. The report quotes from recent work that shows extensive plant and crop growth due to the atmospheric fertilisation that has enhanced photosynthesis and improved water use efficiency. Over the past 60+ years, the authors observe that there have been thousands of studies on the response of plants to rising CO2 levels, and the overwhelming theme is that they benefit from the extra gas. In 2016, Zhu et al detected greening over 25%–50% of the planet. But there is a near official news blackout on the subject. A few mentions can be found in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports but overall, observe the authors, “the Policymakers Summaries, Technical Summaries and [IPCC] Synthesis reports of AR5 and ASR6 do not discuss the topic”. Needless to say there are few kind words for the climate projections based on the notorious IPCC emission scenario known as RCP8.5. Most academic climate impact studies in recent years are based on this extreme scenario, “that is now considered implausible”. Why is this castigation important – because RCP8.5 litters the scientific clickbait literature and has a key role in promoting the Net Zero plan. Most stories in mainstream media debunked in recent years by the Daily Sceptic and others – from the future collapsing Gulf Stream to the disappearing coral – are based on this trash “business-as-usual” computer model pathway. Climate models are noted to be the primary tool used to project future climate changes in response to higher levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. It might be added that their outputs are the basis of 40 years of fear mongering designed to drive Net Zero and the destruction of the hydrocarbon industrial economy. “Of great concern”, continue the authors, “is the fact that after several decades of the climate modelling enterprise involving approximately three dozen models operated by research centres around the world, the range of future warming they produce in response to a hypothetical doubling of CO2 extends over a factor of three”. This range of disagreement among models has not decreased for decades, they add. Those inclined to use less charitable language might comment that climate models are useless for the purpose of providing genuine science upon which reasonable public policy can be determined – and always have been. Much of the recent climate fear mongering surrounds ‘extreme’ weather events and the suggestion that something Nature has always thrown at life on Earth can now be directly attributed to the actions of humans. The most prominent in this field is the Green Blob-funded World Weather Attribution (WWA) run out of Imperial College in London and headed by BBC favourite, Dr Friederike Otto. “WWA’s extensive promotion of non-peer-reviewed findings, its open admission to shaping analyses to serve litigation, and its methodological challenges have sparked controversy”, it is noted. The biggest problem (apart from using computer models) is the lack of past data on extreme weather events. A few years of data allied to an unproven conviction that all current warming is caused by humans, cannot provide guidance for events that crop up as outliers. If paleoclimate reconstruction are considered, “it becomes very difficult for an event to pass thresholds of what is expected from natural variability”, it is concluded.

    "fullContent": "Meta Found Guilty Of Eavesdropping On Period-Tracker App Users: Jury A San Francisco Jury found on Friday that Meta had eavesdropped on the users of a popular period-tracking app, Flo. The lawsuit, was filed in 2021 by eight women against Flo and a group of other tech companies including Google and Facebook, now known as Meta. The app asked users about their sex lives, mental health and diets before guiding them through menstruation and pregnancy. The women, who based their claims on a 2019 Wall Street Journal story and a 2021 FTC investigation, allege that Flo then shared some of that data with the tech giants, SFGATE reports. Google, Flo, and analytics company Flurry all settled with the plaintiffs, however Meta fought through the entire trial and lost. The case against Meta focused on its Facebook software development kit, which Flo added to its app and which is generally used for analytics and advertising services. The women alleged that between June 2016 and February 2019, Flo sent Facebook, through that kit, various records of “Custom App Events” — such as a user clicking a particular button in the “wanting to get pregnant” section of the app. Their complaint also pointed to Facebook’s terms for its business tools, which said the company used so-called “event data” to personalize ads and content. In a 2022 filing, the tech giant admitted that Flo used Facebook’s kit during this period and that the app sent data connected to “App Events.” But Meta denied receiving intimate information about users’ health. -SFGate The jury didn't buy Meta's argument - ruling against them in a unanimous decision, and finding that Flo's users had a reasonable expectation that they weren't being overheard or recorded, and found that Meta did not have consent to eavesdrop or record. The company was found to have violated California's Invasion of Privacy Act. According to a June filing about the case's class-action status, over 3.7 million women in the United States registered for Flo between November 2016 and February 2019 - with potential claimants expected to be notified via email and on a case website. Meta told SFGATE that the company \"vigorously\" disagrees with the verdict, and is \"exploring all legal options.\" \"The plaintiffs’ claims against Meta are simply false,\" said company spokesman Chris Sgro. \"User privacy is important to Meta, which is why we do not want health or other sensitive information and why our terms prohibit developers from sending any.\" The plaintiffs, of course, celebrated - with their attorneys Michael Canty and Carol Villegas telling the outlet that the \"verdict is a wake-up call to companies that view consent as a formality and transparency as optional.\" Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 19:40",

    "fullContent": "The Green Hydrogen Hype Is Fading Authored by Tsvetana Paraskova via OilPrice.com, The green hydrogen market is facing significant challenges, including high production costs and insufficient market demand, leading to the cancellation or delay of numerous multi-billion-dollar projects globally. Major energy companies are withdrawing from green hydrogen ventures and returning focus to their core oil and gas businesses, while government policy measures have been insufficient to create the necessary demand for scale-up. Regulatory uncertainties, financing hurdles, and operational challenges are key reasons for the slow uptake of low-carbon hydrogen, impacting projects in regions like Australia, Europe, and the United States. The green hydrogen drive is losing momentum as start-ups face rising costs and uncertain demand while energy majors back out of multi-billion-dollar projects as they return to their core oil and gas business. Low-emissions hydrogen, including the “green” variety produced with electrolysis using renewable energy, remains a small portion of global hydrogen use, which currently is mostly of the type using fossil fuels to make. Despite the promises of zero emissions in green hydrogen use and the environmentally-friendly way of producing green hydrogen, the market has faced up to the fact that the low-carbon type of hydrogen made from renewables remains very expensive and needs a lot of subsidies, incentives, and government support to exist. The promise of green hydrogen is enormous—low-carbon fuels that can help decarbonize heavy industries, including refining and chemicals. But the reality on the ground is quite different. Green hydrogen remains too expensive to warrant multi-billion-dollar investments when demand is not there. Demand is being created by policymakers and governments, which isn’t a good sign of market demand. “Policy measures are still insufficient to create the level of demand needed to scale up production to meet government expectations,” the International Energy Agency (IEA), which has pushed for energy transition for years now, acknowledged in its latest report on hydrogen in October last year. “Stronger government action will be needed to stimulate demand for low-emissions hydrogen as an essential requirement to underpin investments on the supply side,” the agency said. The IEA itself admitted that green energy demand simply isn’t there—and it will not be, unless governments prop up the industry. World demand for hydrogen rose by 2.5% to 97 million tons in 2023, with demand concentrated in refining and chemicals, and mostly covered by hydrogen produced from unabated fossil fuels, the IEA said in its annual hydrogen review. Yet, “several projects have faced delays and cancellations, which are putting at risk a significant part of the project pipeline,” the agency said. According to the IEA, the main reasons for the slow uptake of low-carbon hydrogen “include unclear demand signals, financing hurdles, delays to incentives, regulatory uncertainties, licensing and permitting issues and operational challenges.” The agency said this in October 2024, shortly after Shell and Equinor had ditched plans for low-hydrogen production and transportation in northern Europe, due to a lack of demand. This canceled project was the first of many that followed as the pace of abandoned projects accelerated in 2025. Australia, Europe, and the United States have all seen halted or canceled green hydrogen projects. Major energy firms have backed out of huge joint venture plans, too. In the United States, President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” accelerated the deadline for phasing out tax credits, adding to the regulatory headwinds to green hydrogen projects, which had been struggling with economic feasibility and commercialization anyway. This has led to several projects being scrapped or halted. Australia’s energy and metals group Fortescue is now reconsidering the timeframes of its planned Arizona Hydrogen venture to produce liquid green hydrogen in the United States. Initially, the project was expected to begin production by the middle of 2026. It’s uncertain now when it would launch, if at all. In Australia, Stanwell has discontinued its involvement in the Central Queensland Hydrogen Project (CQ-H2) and other hydrogen development activities. The multi-billion-dollar CQ-H2 project was worth $9.1 billion (AUS$14 billion) and had planned to start exporting green hydrogen to Japan and Singapore by 2029. Australia, one of the world’s top LNG exporters, last year said it would develop a domestic green hydrogen industry and export clean hydrogen in a bid to become a global hydrogen leader. Another big hit to Australia’s green hydrogen ambitions came last week, when oil and gas supermajor BP withdrew from operatorship and its majority stake in Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH), one of the world’s top renewable energy projects that could generate 26 GW of combined solar and wind power and would cost $36 billion (AUS$55 billion). “They were particularly looking to produce hydrogen, and that really was the weakness of the project,” Ray Wills, University of Western Australia adjunct professor and director of Future Smart Strategies, told Australia’s ABC News.

    "fullContent": "Florida Man Turns In 50 Pounds Of Cocaine He Discovered Floating In The Ocean A Florida boater stumbled upon the plot of a Netflix cartel drama—23 tightly wrapped bricks of suspected cocaine bobbing five miles off Islamorada—and, in a shocking twist, didn’t grab them and speed away. Instead, he called the cops, according to the Daily Mail. The Monroe County Sheriff’s Office says the mystery mariner found over 50 pounds of black brick-shaped packages drifting in turquoise waters on Thursday. Deputies, with help from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, hauled the 23 kilos ashore. The stash was turned over to federal agents, who are now testing it, though officials are pretty confident it’s cocaine. Photos show the “party favors” floating serenely before being scooped up by law enforcement. Whether the Good Samaritan will get a reward—or just bragging rights—is unclear. The Daily Mail writes that holding onto cartel-marked cocaine isn’t just reckless; it’s a legal time bomb. “It should go without saying that retaining possession of (a washed-up block of drugs) is an incredibly bad idea…” Florida law firm Perlet & Shiner warned, noting that keeping a $100,000 brick could mean “grand theft in the first degree, which can carry up to 30 years in prison, plus significant fines.” The Keys are no stranger to “blow bales.” Just weeks ago, a Panhandle beachgoer stumbled across $500,000 worth of cocaine. Last year alone, authorities recovered over 180 pounds statewide, from floating bricks near Key West to stashes buried in Volusia County sand. Smugglers often dump cargo when chased by law enforcement, letting the currents—and occasionally storms like Hurricane Debby—deliver it ashore. It’s not just a human problem, either. Scientists have even raised concerns that dumped cocaine could be affecting Florida’s marine life—yes, including sharks. Which is one more reason to leave floating cartel care packages to the professionals. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/06/2025 - 18:50",

    "fullContent": "The Linguistic Kill-Switch: Inside The Modern Propaganda Playbook Authored by Nick Giambruno via The Epoch Times, The next time someone sneers “conspiracy theorist,” “anti-vaxxer,” “climate denier,” “far right,” “hate speech,” “terrorist,” or the ever-popular “racist,” understand what they are really saying: stop thinking. These words are a linguistic kill-switch—engineered to short-circuit thought by triggering a reflexive emotional spasm. If you encounter someone using these words, you can be certain you are not dealing with someone interested in a good faith effort to find the truth. These terms are precision-guided psychological weapons, fired by unseen hands to herd the public mind. Recall the CIA’s own 1967 memo coining “conspiracy theorist” expressly to silence anyone doubting the magic-bullet fairy tale that supposedly killed JFK. Although they are a poor substitute for an actual argument, these propaganda terms unfortunately work on many people. Call someone one of these words and you no longer need to refute their ideas with facts, logic, or reason. The slur does the work like magic. Take the granddaddy of all elastic scare-labels: terrorism. One hundred years ago the word barely existed. Today it vaporizes civil liberties on contact. Glenn Greenwald nailed it: the T-word is “simultaneously the single most meaningless and most manipulated word in the American political lexicon.” The only difference between a freedom fighter and a terrorist is who controls the narrative. Greenwald elaborates: “There is this common paradox which is that the words that are most frequently used and have the greatest impact are often the words that are the most ill-defined. And therefore subject to manipulation, deceit, and propaganda. So the word ‘terrorist’ for example is something that pervades countless political discussions of great significance. And we are essentially at the point, literally, where if the government points to somebody and simply utters the word ‘terrorist,’ and large numbers of citizens… will cheer for whatever it is that is done… No matter how lawless, no matter how little evidence has been presented to justify it, the mere fact that they have been labeled a ‘terrorist’ is something that will basically cause a majority of people to sanction whatever is done. And yet what is so fascinating about the word ‘terrorist’ is that it really is a term that has absolutely no fixed meaning, it’s simply a term that means whatever the person wielding it wants it to mean.” Greenwald continues: “Because the word terrorism is so potent and shuts down all debate, the mere application of that label by the government, anonymously and with no evidence… has made huge numbers of people stand up and cheer the most radical power a government can seize, which is the power to target one’s own citizens for death, for assassination, in total secrecy and with no due process. And that to me really illustrates the potency of how these propagandistic terms are wielded…. If we’re really going to vest virtually unlimited power in the government to do anything it wants to people they call ‘terrorists,’ we ought at least to have a common understanding of what the term means. But there is none. It’s just become a malleable, all-justifying term to allow the US government carte blanche to do whatever it wants. ‘Terrorism’ is really more of a hypnotic mantra than an actual word.” In short, say the magic T-word and—poof—your rights, your property, your life evaporate, all without trial, all to thunderous applause. The Antidote Using these words is almost like casting a spell—most people who hear them become hypnotized, immediately stop thinking, and turn into easily herded automatons. Fortunately, the counter-spell is simple: demand consistent and logical definitions. Make them spell out exactly what they mean by “terrorist,” or “science denier.” Watch their argument collapse into ad hominem attacks, straw men arguments, appeals to emotion, and crocodile tears. And if that all fails they will play the “racist” card. That’s the playbook. In short, when sophistry is all they have, facts become kryptonite. The propaganda spell breaks the moment you refuse to flinch at the linguistic kill-switch. The good news is that it’s a fragile method of control; people can snap out of their hypnosis. And once they do, they never go back. It’s like pulling back the curtain to see the Wizard of Oz and still being intimidated by him… that just doesn’t happen. So never stop asking questions and thinking critically. Don’t be intimidated by cowards, intellectual midgets, charlatans, and petty tyrants who use propaganda words to get you to shut up and stop thinking. And when they reach for the next emotionally-charged empty label, smile and say: “Is that all you’ve got?” * * * You’ve just seen how a handful of engineered words can disarm an entire population. Refusing the verbal trap is only half the battle—real protection requires action before the next wave of crises rolls in. Currency debasement, confiscatory policies, and the weaponization of language are accelerating. We’ve built a concise, free briefing that shows exactly what’s coming next and the three moves you can make right now to safeguard your money, your mobility, and your freedom.

    "fullContent": "The Dark Side Of Big Solar Exposed As The Fight To Save Farmland Heats Up This is precious farmland. Now this is precious farmland bulldozed in the name of the so-called \"green\" energy movement - all to fight a 'climate crisis' that exists more in the headlines of leftist corporate propaganda media outlets than in the actual world. Remember this... Citizens around the world have been spoon-fed doomsday climate propaganda for decades - and warned of an impending climate apocalypse that never arrives. Yet every year, climate taxes increase and energy costs soar, as well as power grid reliability crumbles. Why? Because climate alarmist progressives have hijacked energy policy, pushing reckless green agendas that are now backfiring. Spain's blackout a few months ago provided a glimpse into what it truly means to be 'net zero' for a day... Now, households and businesses across the U.S. Mid-Atlantic are feeling the pain as their power bills skyrocket, courtesy of Democrat-led green energy delusion... Since 2015, global solar installations have outpaced all fossil fuels combined. In 2024, the U.S. solar sector grew significantly, and public support for solar is at an all-time high. Yet there's a dark side to solar. We already know it's an unreliable form of power generation, but did you know one of its major drawbacks is the massive land requirement? Solar projects are now surpassing 200 megawatts in size, and to support them, companies are gobbling up vast swaths of precious farmland. This land grab has ignited the early stages of a global revolt. \"From Spain to Texas and India to England, solar projects are encroaching on prime agricultural land. Farmers and ranchers are fighting back,\" energy expert Robert Bryce explained in a new short-form documentary titled \"SUNBLOCK: The Global Fight To Save Farmland From Big Solar.\" Here’s a trailer for my short new documentary on the global fight to save farmland from Big Solar. You can watch the entire 10-minute film by clicking here: https://t.co/XBoesYprxJ pic.twitter.com/WbDIM4fKjG — Robert Bryce (@pwrhungry) August 5, 2025 Bryce highlighted the glaring inefficiency of the green energy push: a 270-megawatt solar plant in Texas that consumes 2,300 acres of farmland, while a 1,200-megawatt natural gas facility down the road delivers 88 times more power on just 26 acres... So for the \"efficiency\" of the green revolution... Bryce pointed out - and we agree - that the most efficient forms of power for fueling AI data centers and other emerging electrification trends are nuclear and natural gas. Solar may work well on the rooftops of homes or businesses, but as the energy expert warned, its dark side lies in the massive land grab of valuable farmland. Is there a secret agenda behind the destruction of farmland for sprawling fields of unreliable solar panels? It's time to reevaluate the solar agenda - and hold leftist lawmakers accountable in elections, from city halls to Capitol Hill, for pushing climate crisis propaganda that's devouring our farmland in pursuit of a utopian green fantasy that will never materialize (well, it will with nuclear).

    "fullContent": "Trump Admin Unveils Rule 'To Unleash American Drone Dominance' Authored by Jackson Richman via The Epoch Times, The Trump administration has announced a proposed rule on drones aimed at stimulating the U.S. drone market. “We are going to unleash American drone dominance,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at an Aug. 5 press conference. Duffy noted that China dominates drones with 90 percent control of the market. “We’re turning over our skies to one of our main adversaries,” he said. The new rule would allow people to get products such as a Starbucks cup of coffee via drone, he said, adding that it will also change energy production, farming, manufacturing, and filmmaking. This regulation deals with drones being flown beyond the visual line of sight. It will be open to public comment for 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. “Operators in the past would have to get individual waivers to operate these drones, very complicated. They were issued on a case-by-case basis, and because of that complication, I don’t think we saw the innovation that we should have in America,” Duffy said. “We are going to eliminate that prior process, and the approval will be done in a far different way. The rules are going to completely change the way that drone use is going to be approved, and what this is going to do is, again, allow our innovators and businesses to continue to create and innovate and change the way our industry works with the use of these drones.” Under the regulation, commercial drones would operate at under 400 feet above ground, and operators would need Federal Aviation Administration approval to fly them in certain airspaces. The drones can weigh up to 1,320 pounds, including what they’re carrying. The proposed regulation was developed under an executive order that President Donald Trump signed on June 6 titled “Unleashing American Drone Dominance.” “The United States must accelerate the safe commercialization of drone technologies and fully integrate UAS into the National Airspace System,” it stated. “The time has come to accelerate testing and to enable routine drone operations, scale up domestic production, and expand the export of trusted, American-manufactured drone technologies to global markets. “Building a strong and secure domestic drone sector is vital to reducing reliance on foreign sources, strengthening critical supply chains, and ensuring that the benefits of this technology are delivered to the American people.” The rule would also require operators to address security risks, such as protecting drones from intentional electronic interference.
