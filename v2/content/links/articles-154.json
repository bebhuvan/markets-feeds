    "fullContent": "To Kill An Operation Mockingbird: Tulsi Goes To War With The CIA's Propaganda Yobbos Authored by Kevin Downey Jr via PJMedia.com, Former Democratic Party presidential hopeful and current Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is giving the CIA an enema, and she's putting the hose where it is most needed: in the sketchy, unofficial offices of Operation Mockingbird, the CIA's not-so-secret department dedicated to propaganda. The CIA has been bribing/threatening/installing journalists to do their bidding since the beginning of the Cold War. It is believed they had/have roughly 400 journalists, news reporters, and publishers throughout the world, writing what the CIA tells them to write. In the mid-1970s, Operation Mockingbird was exposed by the Church Committee, led by Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho). The committee found that the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and various other alphabet agencies were illegally bugging, wiretapping, and harassing people, even Americans, the most notable of whom was Martin Luther King, Jr. The Church Committee slapped the CIA on the wrist and told them to end Operation Mockingbird, but, exasperatingly, the committee didn't provide any oversight to make sure that Mockingbird was dead. According to the Church Committee Report on Foreign and Military Intelligence of 1976 (page 455), Mockingbird thrives to this day. Watch Robert Kennedy, Jr. explain how some of the fake news crims, including Rolling Stone and Vox, are nothing more than CIA-run rumor mills. So that leads us to where we are now. Tulsi Gabbard believes Operation Mockingbird isn't merely still alive and kicking, but that it's being used to slander President Trump. 9In my opinion, it is also being used to spread globalist codswallop.) Even better, Gabbard is dedicated to tearing it down. SCARY: Tulsi Gabbard CONFIRMS That ‘Operation Mockingbird’ is STILL Ongoing inside the CIA and she is actively trying to Shut it Down. Tulsi says Deep State intel agents are still actively colluding with left-wing media outlets to attack President Trump from within: “There are… pic.twitter.com/CZWMERFsa3 — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) July 31, 2025 What you're about to see is not comedy. It's tragically cringeworthy propaganda being progenerated by a globalist shill who needs to be drummed out of the comedy community forever. Welcome to late-night brainwashing, courtesy of, I believe, Operation Mockingbird: Watch former CIA Director John Brennan squirm like a worm under the magnifying glass of the Trump administration's take-down of swamp wigglers like himself: 🚨BREAKING: Former CIA Director John Brennan confirmed @DNIGabbard's claim that Operation Mockingbird remains active. He stuttered after realizing what he just said. \"Intelligence really undergirds a lot of the political efforts underway...\" pic.twitter.com/xG9NLbXmja — Gunther Eagleman™ (@GuntherEagleman) August 1, 2025 DNI Gabbard claims she is dedicated to ending the unofficial \"Operation Mockingbird.\" I can't be more giddy. I suspect there are no hallway signs at the Pentagon stating \"Operation Mockingbird Offices This Way,\" and thus stabbing the problem in its heart may prove difficult. Operation Mockingbird is likely why your hirsute thing-in-law believes Trump said to take \"horse pills\" to beat COVID, which came from a bat salad, and so many other lies we've seen pushed by the media. Operation Mockingbird gave us all of this flapdoodle: pic.twitter.com/KzmE9CaG1F — The Kevin Downey, Jr. Show Mon- Fri. 9-11 am EST! (@KDJRadioShow) August 3, 2025 I believe the darker threat isn't fake news, but the seemingly unquenchable thirst for more of the same. Killing Operation Mockingbird is integral, but teaching leftoids they've been lied to for decades is the true challenge. Watch this video, and the meaning of the name \"Operation Mockingbird\" will become terrifyingly clear: Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 15:25",

    "fullContent": "Biden Handlers Ready To Unleash Trove Of Embarrassing Kamala Stories In Response To Her Book Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, Joe Biden’s inner circle are reportedly preparing to spill all the beans on just how awful Kamala Harris was as Vice President should her upcoming book put him in a bad light. That’s according to journalist Mark Halperin, who claims Biden loyalists have a store of embarrassing stories they’re holding back but will make public should Harris negatively reference Biden’s cognitive decline. It’s now common knowledge that Biden’s camp, particularly his wife, despise Harris for going along with the Democratic Party coup against Joe. Biden allies prepared to unload ‘Palinesque’ stories about Kamala Harris if she discusses his cognitive decline: report https://t.co/wkCzzxmhCW pic.twitter.com/Wd4KNyOoZs — New York Post (@nypost) August 2, 2025 In an appearance on The Morning Meeting show, Halperin stated “I will tell you, and this has never been reported, barely at all: if the Biden people decide that Kamala Harris is coming after Joe Biden, wait till you hear the ‘Palinesque’ stories about how much they tried to help her be prepared to be vice president and be in a position to run.” Halperin further claimed that the details will expose “How much they decided, ‘Not happening. She’s not up to this.’” “If the Biden people feel threatened, you will hear stories about Kamala Harris as Vice President that will not make her look good,” Halperin urged. “It’s not like they’re at war currently, but I’m telling you, if Joe Biden feels threatened, if his people feel threatened by her, this is gonna escalate in a big way,” he added. Halperin further asserted that the Biden inner circle pulled out all the stops “in trying to help her do the job of vice president.” “They gave her every opportunity. And they did — they found in some instances that she had some issues,” he emphasized. Yeah, we noticed. Harris announced the upcoming memoir this week with several bizarre cackling social media posts and appearances reminding the entire world just how much of a bullet we all dodged. Meanwhile, one of Biden’s top aides Mike Donilon has revealed that he made a whopping $4 million working for him in 2024 alone. According to Axios, Donilon was also slated to receive another $4 million if Biden was somehow able to get reelected. The details came out in closed-door testimony to the House Oversight Committee which is investigating the cover up of Biden’s cognitive decline.

    "fullContent": "Netanyahu Has Reportedly Opted For Permanent Military Occupation Of Gaza Israel's Channel 12 broadcaster is reporting that the Israeli government has made the decision to occupy the Gaza Strip on a permanent basis. Correspondent Amit Segal reports Monday, \"Senior official in Netanyahu’s office: The decision has been made — we’re going to occupy Gaza.\" Via euromedmonitor.org The top official has been further quoted as saying: \"If we do not act now, hostages will die of starvation and Gaza will remain under Hamas control.\" But the last days have seen conflicting reports over the status and future of the ground operation, dubbed 'Gideon's Chariots'. What has become clear in the last week is that negotiations are off, as Prime Minister Netanyahu ordered an expanded ground incursion in central Gaza. With much of the Strip already decimated, and inhabitants on the verge of mass starvation, a big question has remained for Netanyahu: what's next? Hardline politicians in his own cabinet have called for the total removal of the Palestinian population, after President Trump months ago talked about turning the enclave into the 'Rivera of the Mediterranean'. Indeed a key question remains, will Trump back a plan of permanent Israeli military occupation? This would certainly open up the likelihood of eventual annexation of the territory. ⚡️ Israel decides to ‘OCCUPY’ Gaza — Channel 12 Top official: ‘If we do not act now, hostages will DIE of starvation and Gaza will remain under Hamas control’ Will Trump support this? pic.twitter.com/vuQFFEg1mg — RT (@RT_com) August 4, 2025 But without doubt, a Hamas insurgency will remain active for the time being. But the race will be on to save the remaining hostages, who have been filmed in starving and extreme conditions by their Hamas and Islamic Jihad captors. Also on Monday, US House Speaker Mike Johnson travelled to the Israeli occupation settlement of Ariel in the West Bank, declaring while there that the Palestinian territory is the \"rightful property\" of the Jewish people. mike johnson, who literally shut down the house last week to block the release of the epstein files, is now praying at the western wall in a yarmulke… pic.twitter.com/TV3XUe1HzR — Jon Miller (@MillerStream) August 3, 2025 In response, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry (PA) condemned his visit and \"inflammatory statements on the annexation of the West Bank.\" It further said, \"The ministry considers this a blatant violation of international law, international legitimacy resolutions, and the Arab and American efforts to stop the war, halt the cycle of violence, and achieve calm.\" Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 15:05",

    "fullContent": "Don't Overlook Hillary Clinton Authored by Kenin Spivak via RealClearPolitics, Before Barack Obama’s CIA Director John Brennan and 50 other intelligence analysts deceived Americans in the run-up to the 2020 election by warning that Hunter Biden’s laptop had “all the earmarks of a classic Russian information operation” – and before Obama, Brennan, Obama’s FBI Director James Comey, and National Intelligence Director James Clapper falsified an Intelligence Community Assessment in December 2016 to destabilize Donald Trump’s first term – there was Hillary Clinton. The media’s focus these days is on President Trump’s possible cameo in the so-called “Epstein files” and Obama’s role in advancing the Russia collusion hoax. These stories crossed when DNI Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe released compelling evidence that six weeks before his term concluded, Obama pressed the intelligence community to ignore its previous assessments and instead rely on the sham Steele dossier and an ambiguous and unverifiable sentence fragment to smear Trump and undermine his presidency before it began. But let’s not forget the Clinton campaign’s role in this kabuki dance. Clinton, not Obama, was Trump’s opponent in the 2016 election. As we learned last week from the declassification of reports issued by Gabbard and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, the weight of the heretofore concealed evidence is that if Putin had a preference, it was most likely Clinton – not the wildcard first-time officeholder who surprised the world by winning. According to the now declassified September 2020 majority staff report of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Putin’s principal goal was to undermine faith in the U.S. democratic process, not help any particular candidate. Thus, he chose not to leak the most compromising allegations about Clinton, presumably so that he could later use them to weaken her expected presidency. If Russia really wanted to help Trump, the purported information – whether true or not – would have been released during the campaign. The intelligence community and media, which did have a clear favorite in 2016, carefully hid the compromising accusations, including secret meetings in which State Department representatives are alleged to have unlawfully offered assistance to religious groups in exchange for their support in the 2016 election, along with emails from Democratic National Committee officials describing Clinton’s “psycho-emotional problems,” including “uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression, and cheerfulness.” Clinton was said by these sources to be on a daily regimen of “heavy tranquilizers.” Recently declassified intelligence files show that Clinton authorized the bogus Steele dossier during the 2016 campaign to deflect attention from her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state, and to discredit Trump. Obama, his senior intelligence team and Democratic leadership used the dossier to push the dishonest Russia narrative, Trump’s first impeachment, and a largely successful effort to block his first-term agenda. Just a year earlier, a bombshell New York Times report disclosed that Clinton breached core security protocols by exclusively using a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. She may have done so to shield emails about improper Clinton Foundation fundraising efforts, her hiring of private consultants, and other political conflicts. In a highly inappropriate press conference before the 2016 election, Jim Comey took it upon himself to excuse Clinton’s security lapses, curiously asserting that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring a criminal case. An investigation led by Chairman Grassley found that Comey intended to exonerate Clinton even before the FBI interviewed her. On July 21, 2025, Grassley released a long buried June 2018 FBI Inspector General report that concluded the FBI never fully investigated Clinton’s use of the private server. Further, contrary to sound investigative protocols, witnesses were permitted to attend each other’s depositions, and no action was taken when Clinton’s lawyers accessed confidential information, or when her aides used hammers to destroy BlackBerry phones and BleachBit software to erase the emails. According to Grassley, then-DNC chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz confirmed that Obama scuttled the investigation to protect Clinton’s candidacy. When Clinton served as Obama’s secretary of state, foreign governments and corporations donated hundreds of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and paid Bill Clinton premium prices for speeches, including governments that obtained substantial State Department assistance. Clinton personally attended meetings with foundation donors and sought favors for them, a practice begun when she was New York’s junior senator. Bill Clinton’s White House run was rocked by allegations over investments Bill and Hillary made in the Whitewater Development Corporation. Despite the disappearance of key documents from the White House private quarters, evidence of Hillary’s questionable activities, and the conviction of one of their business partners, neither Clinton faced prosecution. In 1978 and 1979, while first lady of Arkansas, Clinton invested $1,000 in cattle futures, generating almost $100,000 in profit in less than a year. Despite suspicions suggesting that the profits were disguised pay-offs from Tyson Foods and the improbability of such returns, there was no official investigation. While Hillary Clinton’s time on the national stage may be sunsetting, she remains the epitome of the disparate standards to which Republicans and Democrats are held by American elites. Kenin M.
