But given that at this point scores of people are dying each day from hunger, air drops are increasingly a risk everyone (or Western countries) is willing to take - even as Israel's military is still exercising a tight grip on what aid is allowed into Gaza and who distributes it.

Meanwhile, T.J.Muscaro reports for The Epoch Times that Munson Healthcare posted on social media that 11 people were being treated at a hospital in northern Michigan, and a spokeswoman further said that all 11 were stabbing victims. Spokesperson Megan Brown said late Saturday that six were in critical condition and five were in serious condition. The Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office later said in a statement on social media that the suspect was a 42-year-old man who entered the store around 4:45 p.m. A sheriff’s deputy arrived within minutes of the suspect drawing his knife.

The Epstein Affair may be the second type of watershed, only recognized in the rear view mirror. In his post Jeff Epstein, MAGA, and Monopolies, Matt Stoller made two noteworthy observations: 1.
