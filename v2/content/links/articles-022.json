    "fullContent": "HHS Reboots 'Task Force On Safer Childhood Vaccines' Authored by Jon Fleetwood, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Thursday announced the reinstatement of the Task Force on Safer Childhood Vaccines, a federal panel “created by Congress to improve the safety, quality, and oversight of vaccines administered to American children.” “[T]oday’s action reaffirms the Department’s commitment towards continuous improvement in childhood vaccine safety oversight,” the HHS press release reads. “HHS will transmit its first formal report to Congress within two years, with updates every two years thereafter.” The original Task Force had been disbanded in 1998. “By reinstating this Task Force, we are reaffirming our commitment to rigorous science, continuous improvement, and the trust of American families,” said National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. “NIH is proud to lead this effort to advance vaccine safety and support innovation that protects children without compromise.” The Task Force is made up of senior leadership from NIH, FDA, and CDC. Director Bhattacharya will serve as Chairman of the Task Force, per the release. The Task Force will produce recommendations for: “The development, promotion, and refinement of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions than those vaccines currently on the market.” “Improvements in vaccine development, production, distribution, and adverse reaction reporting — along with supporting research to make vaccines safer.” The Defender, a news outlet operated by Children’s Health Defense (founded by current HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.), noted that the announcement came just one day before the agency’s deadline to respond to a lawsuit alleging Kennedy violated federal law by failing to convene the task force after taking office. Filed in May by attorney Ray Flores and funded by CHD, the suit claims Kennedy has been in breach of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which mandates that the HHS secretary establish a vaccine safety task force and submit progress reports to Congress every two years. The Defender explained that the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires HHS to form a task force made up of the health secretary, the FDA commissioner, and the directors of NIH and CDC, and to report to Congress every two years on vaccine safety improvements. Flores says no such reports have been filed in over 35 years. A 2018 lawsuit by Kennedy and Aaron Siri confirmed the absence of any reports, noting that the original task force, created in 1990, was disbanded in 1998. The law allows citizens to sue if these requirements aren’t met, which Flores cited in his case. Whether HHS’s sudden move is a genuine step toward long-overdue vaccine safety oversight—or simply a legal maneuver to head off a citizen-led lawsuit (or both)—remains to be seen. If the Task Force follows through on its mandate, it could finally bring long-absent transparency, accountability, and meaningful safety reforms to the nation’s childhood vaccine program.

    "fullContent": "DC Attorney General Sues Over Trump's 'Hostile Takeover' Washington DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb (D) filed a lawsuit against President Trump early Friday after the administration installed the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) head to command the city's police force. Members of the National Guard patrol at Union Station in Washington on Aug. 14, 2025. Madalina Kilroy/The Epoch Times In a 33-page (!) complaint, Schwalb claims that DEA Administrator Terry Cole's appointment as \"emergency police commissioner\" exceeds the administration's authority in the DC Home Rule Act that Trump invoked in order to clean up the city. The lawsuit seeks to cancel Cole's appointment and keep the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under the command of Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and Police Chief Pamela Smith, who doesn't know what \"chain of command\" means - and says she still reports to Bowser. \"We are suing to block the federal government takeover of D.C. police. By illegally declaring a takeover of MPD, the Administration is abusing its temporary, limited authority under the law. This is the gravest threat to Home Rule DC has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it,\" reads the lawsuit. \"There is no greater risk to public safety in a large, professional police force like MPD than to not know who is in command.\" Trump announced on Aug. 11 that the federal government would take over the capital city's police department in an effort to combat crime and homelessness in the city. He also deployed the National Guard. The Home Rule Act requires the mayor to provide law enforcement \"services\" to the president when special emergency conditions are declared. City leaders initially agreed to comply, but now they say the Trump administration has gone too far. \"By declaring a hostile takeover of MPD, the Administration is abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the District’s right to self-governance and putting the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk. The Administration’s unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call DC home,\" Schwalb said in a press release. Hours earlier on Friday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi issued an order appointing Cole to take command of the force, and required MPD leaders to receive his approval before issuing new directives. Bondi also reportedly rescinded MPD orders limiting how officers could aid immigration enforcement. In response, Schwalb issued a legal opinion stating that the order is unlawful and instructing Smith not to enforce it. \"Section 740 does not authorize this brazen usurpation of the District’s authority over its own government,\" the lawsuit reads.

    "fullContent": "The Usual Suspects: Disclosure On The Scuttled Clinton Foundation Investigation Reveals Familiar Names Authored by Jonathan Turley, As the Trump Administration finally releases the underlying documents related to prior scandals and investigations, the public has learned a great deal about the origins of the Russian collusion investigation and other subjects. This week, another document was released explaining why the investigation into the Clinton Foundation seemed to go nowhere. What is less surprising are the characters involved in shutting down the investigation. It is, as Claude Rains would say, “the usual suspects” from former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates to former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Many of us had written about the allegations of influence peddling by the Clintons. While Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the Clintons raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign sources. Clinton Foundation officials were shown to have intervened for donors at the State Department. Those funds were used not only for the Clinton Foundation programs but also for travel and support for the Clinton family members. (Tellingly, donations reportedly plummeted after Clinton left office). What is striking is that officials who relentlessly pursued Trump and his associates on little evidence were reportedly opposed to aggressive efforts involving the Clintons. I was one of the loudest critics of Sally Yates, who ordered the entire Justice Department not to assist Trump on immigration efforts after his inauguration. In my view, Yates’s conduct (just days before she was scheduled to leave the department) was a raw political move that shattered standards of professional conduct. It would also make her a heroine on the left and in the media. Ultimately, Trump prevailed on the underlying claims of authority raised in the immigration orders before the Supreme Court. In these documents, Yates is shown in an email shutting down the investigation into the Clintons. Despite findings of good cause for further investigation into these allegations of pay-to-play corruption, Yates (then-Deputy Attorney General) is quoted as saying, “Shut it down!” FBI Director Kash Patel released a memo showing a timeline of the interference, including the message from Sally Yates, whom Trump fired as acting attorney general. McCabe, who is now a CNN contributor, is again shown intervening in a crushingly predictable way. The declassified timeline revealed that as early as February 2016, the Justice Department “indicated they would not be supportive of an FBI investigation.” The timeline also shows that, in mid-February 2016, McCabe ordered that “no overt investigative steps” were allowed to be taken in the Clinton Foundation investigation “without his approval” — a command he allegedly repeated numerous times over the coming months. […] The timeline detailed how Yates ordered one of the federal prosecutors to “shut it down,” likely in the March 2016 timeframe. Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) and Eastern District of New York (EDNY) purportedly said in August 2016 that they “would not support the investigation” into the Clinton Foundation, according to the timeline, and that “no explanation was given.” Special Counsel John Durham found that the FBI’s Little Rock and New York investigations “included predication based on source reporting that identified foreign governments that had made, or offered to make, contributions to the Foundation in exchange for favorable or preferential treatment from Clinton.” Nevertheless, the FBI timeline stated that DOJ “indicated they would not be supportive of an FBI investigation” on February 1, 2016. For those of us who closely followed these investigations and wrote about them, this is hardly surprising but still very valuable for historical purposes. The consistent efforts of figures like McCabe only magnify concerns over the role of key figures in pushing investigations of Trump while discouraging investigations of top Democrats. Once again, the media is largely ignoring the disclosures. The same reporters who exhaustively pushed the false Russian collusion claims have little interest in these countervailing disclosures. As with the conduct of Yates and McCabe, that is also an all-too-familiar pattern. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 15:05",

    "fullContent": "Putin Hails 'Heroic' North Korean Troops In Warm Letter To Kim Russian President Vladimir Putin has praised North Korean troops deployed as part of the Ukraine war as \"heroic\" in a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, North Korean state media has revealed Friday. The timing of the letter's revelation is interesting, given that President Putin is currently in Anchorage, Alaska - hours away from meeting with President Donald Trump and the US delegation to talk all things Ukraine war and its resolution. Is this a bit of a troll move by Pyongyang? Via The Associated Press The Putin letter also commemorated Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule, with Putin recalling the joint efforts of Soviet and Korean forces during World War II. He hailed those wartime bonds of \"military friendship and mutual assistance\" and compared them to today, where DPRK troops are deployed in support of Russian forces, reportedly in the Kursk region and possibly even within eastern Ukraine itself. Reports stretching back to last year suggest over ten thousand North Korean troops are there, and possibly more cycling through. In particular Putin highlighted the Korean troop sacrifice to secure the Kursk region as \"heroic\" and said the Russian people would always remember their bravery, according to the state-run KCNA news agency. \"This was fully proved by the heroic participation of the DPRK soldiers in liberating the territory of Kursk region from the Ukrainian occupationists,\" he said The Russian leader also emphasized the two countries' work toward creating a stronger \"multipolar global order\". According to more context via The Guardian: About 600 North Korean soldiers have been killed and thousands more wounded fighting for Russia, Seoul has said. South Korea’s intelligence agency said in June that North Korea was potentially ready to send more troops to Russia. The letter was delivered by the chair of Russia’s Duma – Vyacheslav Volodin – who met Kim during an official visit to Pyongyang on Thursday. Volodin thanked Kim for “dispatching excellent soldiers to the Kursk liberation operations for driving out the Ukrainian aggressors”, according to KCNA. ❗️ Putin CALLS North Korea’s Kim Jong Un DAYS before Trump summit Shares info ahead of talks Leaders agree on MORE direct contact Russian President ‘HIGHLY appreciates’ Pyongyang’s support in liberation of Kursk region from Ukrainian forces https://t.co/a791S16jDF pic.twitter.com/PwlDXg9jjZ — RT (@RT_com) August 12, 2025 Earlier this summer, in July, North Korea's state-run media aired footage showing leader Kim Jong-un mourning the deaths of North Korean soldiers said to be killed while fighting in Russia's war in Ukraine as part of allied forces. The occasion for the memorial footage was the return of the soldiers' remains from Russia, though no details were given as to the number of the deceased being remembered. But the event was significant, offering high-level confirmation of troop deaths related to the Ukraine war. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 14:45",

    "fullContent": "MSNBC Mouthpiece Claims Climate Change Is More Dangerous Than Crime In D.C. Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, An MSNBC talking head claimed Tuesday that climate change is more of a threat in Washington D.C. than crime. Commenting on President Trump’s decision to deploy the National Guard to the capital and federalise some policing, Anand Giridharadas claimed it’s all an authoritarian take over and that crime isn’t a big issue. “Crime is real. It is blown out of proportion. People are feeling much more unsafe than they statistically are—but the feeling matters. People deserve to be safe, but they also deserve to feel safe,” Giridharadas blathered. MSNBC's @Anandwrites: \"When I go to D.C., I’m not afraid of losing my wallet so much as I’m afraid of losing my vote. I’m not afraid of losing my wallet so much as I’m afraid that my children’s freedom to breathe will be stolen in a world where climate change policy is… pic.twitter.com/SR8y91lw7t — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) August 12, 2025 He continued, “I think it is true that Democrats have sometimes ignored or lectured people, holding a spreadsheet of statistics. That said, it’s really important to be clear about what is going on here: a relatively small crime problem is being used for specific authoritarian purposes that we know and understand.” “Let’s be clear—D.C. does have one really big crime problem, which was the January 6th insurrection incited by the current president of the United States,” he continued adding “His first act in coming back was pardoning all the people who tried to overturn constitutional order in Washington, D.C.” “When I go to D.C., I’m not afraid of losing my wallet so much as I’m afraid of losing my vote,” the pundit further remarked. “I’m not afraid of losing my wallet so much as I’m afraid that my children’s freedom to breathe will be stolen in a world where climate change policy is nonexistent,” Giridharadas crowed. “I’m afraid that the future of middle-class people will be stolen by the very things you were talking about cutting—the safety net, Medicaid, rural hospitals,” he further waffled. D.C. murder victims' families: Actually the murderers are scarier than climate change https://t.co/9ujv8BBZvt — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) August 12, 2025 D.C. resident says she welcomes Trump trying to make the city safer: \"I think it's a very good call.\" pic.twitter.com/6AZExBKLlZ — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) August 12, 2025 “We need all the protection we can get … this city is really getting dangerous” https://t.co/Uy0qhgdHcS — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) August 12, 2025 People who talk like this are just outing themselves as elitists. When someone steals your car or assaults you, your perspective changes. When you sit in an ivory tower and conflate politics with safety, you’re so rich you’re unaffected — paige s. (@PaigeSully88) August 12, 2025 Meanwhile, the people actually live in DC are quite concerned about losing their wallets, and their lives. When I lived in DC, someone once broke the window of my car and stole my umbrella because it was raining. That's the utter disregard some people have for others. I saw… — Shoestring Lab (@Shoestring_Lab) August 12, 2025 @AnandWrites claims he's worried about losing his vote, while supporting a party that cheats in elections, pushes illegals to cast ballots and utilizes lawfare against its political opponents. It's hard to measure the level of hypocrisy in his commentary. — Jason Sesler (@jmsesler) August 13, 2025 Nothing screams out of touch more than a bunch of media elites telling the “common” people that they’re much safer than they think. Don’t believe your own experiences — believe us. @MSNBC gaslighting is what they do. — Russ Walker (@RWalkerFW) August 12, 2025 This was all on Morning Joe, the show on which host Joe Scarborough earlier admitted crime is a massive problem in the city. Joe Scarborough reads a text from a \"very liberal\" friend who lives in D.C.: \"I'm not totally opposed to Trump's National Guard move in D.C… crime remains rampant. I've had too many friends carjacked, shot at. None of us will walk more than 3 blocks after 8 P.M.\" pic.twitter.com/LSPLCJj671 — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) August 12, 2025 * * * Your support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.
