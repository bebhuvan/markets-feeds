It makes no sense at all,” said Max Steier of the Partnership for Public Service.

Araghchi said that his message to Witkoff has been that there needs to be a “win-win” deal and that the US needs to show real “confidence-building” measures.</p> <p>“The road to negotiation is narrow but<strong> it’s not impossible</strong>. I need to convince my hierarchy that if we go for negotiation, the other side is coming with real determination for a win-win deal,” he said.</p> <p>The US has also shown no sign that it’s willing to give Iran assurances that it won’t be attacked again, since President Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb the country again if it restarts its nuclear enrichment program. Araghchi reaffirmed that Tehran wouldn’t agree to a deal that doesn’t allow it to enrich uranium at low levels.</p> <p>“We can negotiate, they can present their argument and we will present our own argument,” Araghchi said.<strong> “But with zero enrichment, we don’t have a thing,”</strong> Araghchi.</p> <p>He also reaffirmed that Iran didn’t want a nuclear bomb and would continue to abide by a 2003 fatwa from the Iranian Supreme Leader that prohibited the production of nuclear weapons.</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T16:50:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 12:50</span>",

This full-blown affordability crisis is hollowing out the middle class from within. Add years of mass migration of millions of illegal aliens, and the wealth and opportunities once available to the native population have eroded even further. It's becoming impossible to ignore that many policymakers in Washington, seemingly aligned with the globalist billionaires, have deliberately waged economic war on America's middle class. This is precisely why President Trump rose to power. </p> <p>Two of the core bedrocks of the middle class include homeownership and family formation.

Vance with ensuring that no funding went to “exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy.”</p> <p>The Smithsonian’s announcement on Friday came as another publicly funded nonprofit under fire for its political bias announced that it was closing shop.</p> <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which bankrolled outlets like <a href=\"https://headlineusa.com/tag/npr\">NPR</a> and <a href=\"https://headlineusa.com/tag/pbs\">PBS</a> through its congressional grants, announced its closure following Congress’s passage of the Rescissions Act last month, which clawed back some $9 billion in partisan public funding and <a href=\"https://headlineusa.com/tag/federal-spending\">spending</a> excesses.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">BREAKING: The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is shutting down citing loss of federal funding. <a href=\"https://t.co/JmmJ92J9NG\">pic.twitter.com/JmmJ92J9NG</a></p> — ALX 🇺🇸 (@alx) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alx/status/1951343528652710024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>CPB stood to lose $1.1 billion from the rollback, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/18/nx-s1-5469912/npr-congress-rescission-funding-trump\">according to NPR</a>.</p> <p>Leftists lashed out following the legislation’s passage, insisting—despite a <a href=\"https://headlineusa.com/25-year-npr-vet-admits-far-left-coverage/\">preponderance of evidence</a> to the contrary—that it was nonpartisan and that its programming performed a critical service to the public interest.</p> <p>“Parents and children, senior citizens and students, tribal and rural communities—all will bear the harm of this vote,” said <a href=\"https://headlineusa.com/tag/katherine-maher\">Katherine Maher</a>, NPR’s president and CEO, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/18/g-s1-78150/unprecedented-rescission-bill-defunds-public-media\">in a statement</a> responding to the cuts.</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T15:40:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 11:40</span>",

Churches in this southern area have also been burned and destroyed.</p> <p data-end=\"484\" data-start=\"227\">This has brought Damascus under greater international scrutinty and spotlight, though Washington has tended to overlook the atrocities carried out also against Christians and Alawites. However, the <strong>US did oversee the initial truce which now appears in shambles due to this latest fighting</strong>.</p> <p data-end=\"484\" data-start=\"227\">The southern Syria region is poised to unravel, also as Israel appears engaged in <strong>more land-grab</strong> <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/one-killed-after-armed-groups-attack-syrian-security-forces-sweida\">activity</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>A security source told the outlet the armed groups had violated a ceasefire agreed in the predominantly Druze region, which has seen more than 1,000 killed in fighting over the past month.</em></p> <p><em>Violence in Sweida erupted on 13 July between Bedouin fighters, Druze factions and government forces. Israel also carried out strikes on Syrian cities, claiming they were coming to the assistance of the Druze.</em></p> </blockquote> <p data-end=\"1674\" data-start=\"1398\">According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based anti-Assad monitoring group, the Sweida clashes left one Druze fighter dead and at least nine others wounded. The violence occurred at the Tal al-Hadeed heights, a strategic area overlooking neighboring Daraa province, the latter long being a hotbed of unrest.</p> <p data-end=\"1674\" data-start=\"1398\">In the north, the HTS-run Syrian Defense Ministry claimed that SDF rocket attacks injured three civilians and four soldiers. But this narrative was rejected by SDF officials.</p> <p data-end=\"1674\" data-start=\"1398\"><em>Pentagon troops still occupy portions of northeast Syria, while Western intelligence agencies set the stage for Jolani's (President Sharaa) rise...</em></p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Video from last night shows <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CIA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CIA</a>-backed Al-Julani militias launch rockets towards <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pentagon?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Pentagon</a>-backed Kurdish SDF militias positions in Deir Hafir, east of Aleppo, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Syria?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Syria</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/RqZEv7USUm\">pic.twitter.com/RqZEv7USUm</a></p> — Southern Africa Eye (@eye_southern) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eye_southern/status/1952016625357738478?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p data-end=\"2967\" data-start=\"2692\">Meanwhile, in Quneitra province near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, the Israeli military conducted another raid and there are reports of <strong>IDF convoys now situated a mere 11km from Damascus</strong>.</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T15:05:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 11:05</span>",

I find it a little frustrating to read this, because in Europe it does not feel like we are getting a free ride at all. In fact it seems like the opposite: <em><strong>The most common complaint on the populist German right is that our political class refuses to represent our interests and will not stop carrying water for the Americans.</strong></em></p> <p>I recognise that I’ll never be able to put this right, but it’s worth trying, because it is important to understand the world as it is. The truth is that the United States is an imperial power. Generally speaking, it does not give foreign nations free rides and it does not hand out unearned favours. <strong>There is however a lot of confusion here, because hardly anybody bothers to describe honestly the geopolitical strategy pursued by the United States or the nature of the American empire. </strong></p> <p>Western liberalism cannot conceptualise imperial politics, and while empire generally benefits political elites on both sides of the Atlantic, it is not necessarily or always in the interests of ordinary Americans or ordinary Europeans, which is yet another reason not to talk about it.</p> <p><strong>The Americans and the British before them expended enormous effort to preempt the emergence of a dominant power on the European Continent that might challenge their successive naval empires.</strong> They fought two world wars to stop Germany from becoming just such a power. This great struggle ended in 1945 with Western Europe as a fully subjugated imperial province. Since then, the Americans have coordinated the NATO alliance and guaranteed the security of European countries not out of charity, but because Europe is their provincial possession. As a rule, they have not wanted Europe to assume full responsibility for its own defence, because a world in which America no longer guarantees the security of Europe is a world in which Europe is no longer an American province. It’s that simple.</p> <p>To fend off the Soviets, the Americans nevertheless rebuilt and rearmed the nations of Western Europe. Everyone involved in this project had to come up with a way to allow the Germans to become a dominant economic power again, without displacing the United States or provoking the hostilities of wary postwar neighbours like France. <strong>One solution here was the European Union, which promoted economic interdependency as a counterweight to nationalist concerns. </strong>Another solution came at the cultural level, where Germany sought to allay European anxieties over possible Teutonic aggression by developing a national cult of historical guilt for World War II, which steadily blossomed into a full-blown civic religion. This exercise in self-effacement has grown more and not less extreme over time, in part as a response to nervousness about the consequences of German reunification. Many voices on the right like to portray Germans as victims of an externally imposed guilt regime, but the truth is that we did most of this to ourselves. The German left in particular has profited from and encouraged this mindset from the beginning.</p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"https://store.zerohedge.com/multi-function-survival-flashlight/\" data-image-href=\"https://store.zerohedge.com/multi-function-survival-flashlight/\" data-link-option=\"2\" href=\"https://store.zerohedge.com/multi-function-survival-flashlight/\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b895d05f-00e6-438f-acec-93b26b9313e2\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"289\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/survival%20flashlightJPG_0.jpg?itok=x5lhZCBz\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p> <p>German political self-effacement had one unexpected feature, in that it proved to be contagious. <strong>Within a generation of 1945, many of the victorious allied powers were striving to develop their own historical guilt cults after the German example, in each case centred around a national original sin like slavery or colonialism.</strong> Just as the German political class found it expedient to foreground collective European concerns at the expense of a more narrowly construed German nationalism, so did the broader West develop an overarching obsession with global issues and the plight of the developing world. This has caused the proliferation of a lot of silly people in our political culture, a lot of profoundly stupid organisations, and at least two cancerous ideological systems in the form of climatism and migrationism. We have had a nearly incalculable gift in the form of 80 years of peace, which may yet be offset by the equally incalculable costs of the lunacies this peace has encouraged.</p> <p><strong>Trump’s greatest geopolitical ambition is to reorient American foreign policy away from Europe and the minor rivalry with Russia, towards East Asia and the far greater rivalry with China.</strong> This pivot entails a demotion of provincial Europe in the pecking order of empire. The Americans will want Europeans to pay more for their place in the broader imperial system, and they will be inclined to extend the Europeans fewer benefits. That is what a lot of the low-resolution MAGA rhetoric about free-riding Europeans adds up to, it is the meaning of Trump’s demands that European nations massively increase NATO spending, and it has been an important subtext in the tariff negotiations too. So far, NATO member states and the EU have folded to Trump’s demands with very little resistance, despite their extravagance.</p> <p><strong>The truth is that we could fund our own defence for less than 5% of our collective GDP, but this is as yet unthinkable, because European independence would spell the end of our present system. </strong>Basically, there can be no united Europe without the Americans. If and when the Americans leave, some European nations will pursue closer trade relations with Russia; others will oppose them in this. It has been four generations since any major European nation plotted an independent geopolitical agenda; the very idea is a nightmare for our rulers, and many of the resulting alliances would remind people of unfortunate early 20th-century geopolitical configurations. This is primarily why European leaders have developed such a fanatical obsession with the war in Ukraine. For the moment, the conflict defines Russia as an external threat and suppresses all discussions about the different national interests of EU member states. It is yet another way for Germany’s political class to practice their conventional self-effacement in favour of notional pan-European interests.</p> <p>As in many other cases, <strong>Trump’s policies with respect to Europe represent the culmination of forces and trends that are much bigger than his presidency.</strong> The era of unchallenged American global hegemony is over with, and in this environment being a province of the American empire will just become a steadily worse deal for Europe as a whole.</p> <p><em>Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ZeroHedge.</em></p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T14:30:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 10:30</span>",
