    "fullContent": "US Reactivates Military Intelligence Unit On Korean Peninsula In Latest Build-Up Via The Libertarian Institute The Pentagon activated a military intelligence unit in South Korea. The move comes after the US established a second fighter \"super squadron\" on the Korean Peninsula. According to a statement from the US Army, the 528th Military Intelligence Company (MICO) is now operating in South Korea. The 528th will be part of the Second Infantry Division. US Army file image \"2ID is the last remaining permanently forward-stationed division in the U.S. Army. Its purpose is to deter aggression and maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula, and if deterrence fails, ‘Fight Tonight’ in support of the U.S.-Republic of Korea Alliance,\" the Army’s statement explained. The 528th was established during World War II and deployed to the Korean Peninsula during the Korean War. The 528th was disbanded in 2005, after deployments during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. According to the statement, the MICO will be \"utilized to collect, analyze, and disseminate information about enemy forces, terrain, and potential threats to support decision-making and ensure mission success.\" The reestablishment of the military intelligence company follows the Pentagon repositioning dozens of F-16s in South Korea closer to the demilitarized zone. Additionally, Washington and Seoul are set to kick off large-scale war games that often lead to a spike in tensions on the Korean Peninsula. However, the US and South Korea agreed to divide the war games, and will conduct half of the planned military exercises in September. Last month, Pyongyang said it was not interested in bilateral talks with Seoul, but was open to talks with Washington so long as the US dropped its demand for North Korean denuclearization.

    "fullContent": "Netanyahu Says He Backs 'Greater Israel' - Drawing Outrage From Arab States Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has unleashed fresh controversy and anger among Arab countries and leaders by suggesting a huge land expanse of Israel's borders in an interview he gave to i24 News. In the newly published interview he said he is on a \"historic and spiritual mission\" and expressed strong attachment to the vision of a Greater Israel, which is a longtime reference to Israel encompasing parts of Jordan, Egypt and Syria - along with the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Map of 'Greater Israel'. Source: DeviantArt It comes on the heels of some hardline Israeli officials and settler groups loudly proclaiming that soon Israeli forces will be in Damascus. This is all based on Biblical concepts of what God is said to have promised the Jews thousands of years ago. The interviewer had presented Netanyahu with an amulet featuring what he described as a \"map of the Promised Land\" - with the image symbolically depicting the greatly expanded vision of Israel's future. Netanyahu when asked if he feels a connection with this concept of a Greater Israel, responded \"Very much\". The interviewer himself is known to back radical settler ideologies which seek to take land by force from neighboring Arab communities. Among the first regional governments to condemn the remarks has been Jordan. Jordan’s Foreign Ministry highlighed the 'Greater Israel' remarks, commenting that it constitutes \"a dangerous and provocative escalation, a threat to the sovereignty of states, and a violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.\" The ministry further emphasized \"the need for the international community to act immediately to stop all provocative Israeli actions and statements that threaten the region’s stability and international peace and security.\" Netanyahu claims he is on a ‘historical and spiritual mission’ to realize ‘Greater Israel’ pic.twitter.com/T2z3L1mnQd — HatsOff (@HatsOffff) August 12, 2025 Some war monitors fear that the Netanyahu government is in effect already trying to enact this - given that from the start of post-Assad Syria (last December), Israel's military quickly expanded the Golan occupation far beyond, into southern Syria. This is to the point where currently there are reports saying IDF ground forces are a mere dozen kilometers from the outskirts of the capital Damascus. Tyler Durden Wed, 08/13/2025 - 18:50",

    "fullContent": "Financial WMD: How Iran Could Trigger A Global Economic Collapse Authored by Nick Giambruno via InternationalMan.com, Warren Buffett once referred to derivatives as “financial weapons of mass destruction.” He wasn’t being dramatic—he was warning that if things went wrong, these complex financial instruments could cause massive, far-reaching damage to the global economy. What Buffett feared most was how a sudden, unexpected market shock could set off a dangerous chain reaction through the financial system, fueled by the hidden risks and tangled interconnections that derivatives create. These instruments link major banks, hedge funds, and corporations in an intricate web of bets on the future prices of oil, interest rates, currencies, and more. For example, airlines and energy companies routinely use oil-linked derivatives to hedge or speculate. If oil prices were to surge unexpectedly, the counterparties on the losing end—often large financial institutions—would be on the hook for enormous payouts. That, in turn, would trigger margin calls, liquidity crunches, and potentially forced asset sales. The fear spreads quickly, because many of these derivative contracts are opaque—no one really knows who is exposed or by how much. That uncertainty can lead to panic in the markets, as everyone starts pulling back at once. Losses like these rarely stay contained. A default in one part of the system spreads risk outward. If a major player can’t cover its exposure, it endangers its counterparties. If one of those is a major bank, the problem quickly becomes systemic. This is precisely the kind of domino effect Buffett was describing—a market shock lighting fuses in unexpected places, turning financial interconnectivity into financial fragility. Because derivatives are so interconnected and can involve huge sums of money, the damage can grow quickly and unpredictably, much like a series of explosions. That’s why Buffett saw them not just as risky tools, but as potential threats to the entire financial system. In other words, financial WMD. So why bring this up now? Because the recent war between Israel, the US, and Iran is far from over. At some point, a far more serious confrontation between the US and Iran appears inevitable—and when it comes, it will almost certainly disrupt the flow of oil and gas from the Persian Gulf. To call that a severe supply disruption would be an understatement. Consider this. The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow strip of water that links the Persian Gulf to the rest of the world. It’s the world’s single-most important energy corridor, and there’s no alternative route. Five of the world’s top 10 oil-producing countries—Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait—border the Persian Gulf, as does Qatar, the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The Strait of Hormuz is their only sea route to the open ocean… and world markets. At its narrowest point, the space available for shipping lanes in the Strait of Hormuz is just 3.2 kilometers wide. According to the US Energy Information Administration, around 20 million barrels of oil transit the Strait daily, accounting for roughly 20% of global oil production—worth about $1.4 billion per day at current prices. Another 20% of global LNG exports also move through the Strait. It’s hard to overstate the importance of the Strait of Hormuz to the global economy. If someone were to disrupt the Strait, it would ignite a full-blown energy crisis, sending prices soaring and financial markets into chaos. Thanks to its commanding geography and expertise in unconventional and asymmetric warfare, Iran can shut down the Strait, and there’s not much anyone can do about it. It’s Iran’s geopolitical trump card. Analysts believe it could take weeks to reopen, if at all. Pentagon war games have shown that in a full-scale war, the US Navy would be unable to keep the Strait open. Faced with swarming missile attacks, American forces would either have to withdraw or risk total annihilation. Worse still, Iran could target oil infrastructure across the Persian Gulf, destroying production facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait. Even if the Strait reopened, there could be nothing left to export. Military strategists have known this for decades, yet no viable strategy has ever emerged to neutralize Iran’s leverage. Tehran has made it clear: if a full-scale war breaks out, it will close the Strait and destroy the Persian Gulf’s energy infrastructure. In short, Iran holds a knife to the throat of the global economy. Since the 1979 Revolution, the US has sought to overthrow Iran’s government. But Iran’s control over the Strait has long served as a powerful deterrent to regime change. That deterrence, however, may be breaking down. We are now in the midst of World War 3—and Iran has become the decisive battleground. The US and Israel may be willing to risk global economic collapse to topple the Iranian government, a move that would dramatically shift the global balance of power in their favor. If a war with Iran shuts down the Strait of Hormuz, the impact would dwarf every oil crisis in modern history. During the first oil shock in 1973, about 5 million barrels were removed from the global oil market. At the time, daily global oil production was around 56 million barrels. That means roughly 9% of the world’s supply vanished. Oil prices roughly quadrupled. In the second oil shock of 1979, about 4 million barrels disappeared from the market. Daily production was around 67 million barrels—so about 6% of global supply was lost. Oil prices nearly tripled. Then, in 1990, during Saddam’s invasion of Kuwait, about 4.3 million barrels were removed. With global production at roughly 66 million barrels per day, that was a 7% supply loss. Oil prices more than doubled. Now compare that to a Strait of Hormuz shutdown, which could instantly remove 20 million barrels from a global market producing about 100 million barrels per day—a staggering 20% of supply gone overnight. This would be the largest supply shock in history. By far. If war with Iran proceeds and Tehran closes the Strait of Hormuz, I think the effect on the price of oil will be at least as severe as it was during the 1973 oil shock, which saw oil prices go up 4x. A similar move today could see oil prices above $275 a barrel. However, I consider that a conservative estimate because closing the Strait of Hormuz would cause a much larger supply shock than the 1973 OPEC oil embargo. And unlike financial crises of the past, this one can’t be fixed with printed money. Central banks can inject liquidity, but they can’t manufacture oil. Physical supply shortages aren’t solvable by monetary policy. Even the combined efforts of the US and Russia to increase oil production couldn’t replace the missing 20 million barrels per day quickly enough to prevent market chaos. This kind of price shock would hit derivatives markets like a sledgehammer, where oil and gas are heavily traded via futures, options, and swaps. Any firm on the wrong side of the trade would face steep losses, triggering margin calls, liquidity demands, and potential defaults. Big banks that serve as counterparties or intermediaries would be directly exposed to the fallout. This could set off a cascade of defaults and margin calls that ripple through the global financial system—and make 2008 look tame by comparison. A closure of the Strait of Hormuz is a credible trigger for a catastrophic global economic depression. Iran’s true nuclear option isn’t a warhead—it’s a financial WMD, setting off a chain reaction by shutting down the Strait and sending oil prices through the roof, detonating the derivatives bomb at the heart of the global financial system. * * * As tensions escalate and the risk of a full-scale conflict with Iran grows, so too does the potential for a financial chain reaction unlike anything we’ve seen before. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz wouldn’t just trigger an oil shock—it could ignite a global economic crisis that dwarfs 2008.

    "fullContent": "\"Price-Spikes & Blackouts\": America's Power Crisis Is Just Getting Started The epicenter of America's power crisis appears to be on the PJM Interconnection grid, with the Mid-Atlantic area at ground zero. Power bills in the Baltimore area are skyrocketing, driven mostly by disastrous green policies that have shuttered reliable, low-cost fossil fuel power generation plants in favor of unreliable solar and wind energy, allegedly to address a climate crisis. Now demand is surging, whether from AI data centers, EVs, or other electrification trends, which means there's a massive mismatch in power supply versus power demand. Goldman analysts led by Hongcen Wei have been tracking the power crisis and warned in a note on Wednesday that power market tightening has expanded from the three grids they covered last month (read here) to all regional markets. \"We find that 9 out of 13 US regional power markets have already reached critical tightness this summer, while expecting all but one to reach critical tightness by 2030,\" Wei wrote in the note to clients. The analyst continued, \"For the rest of this summer, we highlight power reliability risks in PJM (Mid-Atlantic), MISO (Mid-Continent), the Northeast (New York and New England) and the Southeast (Florida and Tennessee), given both critical tightness and forecasted August heatwaves.\" He warned: \"Critical tightness could lead to power price spikes and blackouts with significant social and economic losses.\" As of mid-August, 9 of the 13 U.S. regional power grids have already reached dangerously low spare capacity levels that are at or below the critical reliability threshold. This raises blackout threats and results in power price spikes during high-demand usage hours. On the subject of critical reliability issues, it took just one substation failure earlier this week in Baltimore to put more than a million Baltimore Gas and Electric customers on notice for potential hours-long blackouts. The issue was resolved within hours, but it underscores how fragile the local grid has become after years of epic mismanagement by the state's Democratic leadership under the guise of going 'green'... Delegate Robin Grammer of Baltimore County... It's an unbelievable disgrace what the Democrats have done to the people of this state. https://t.co/ogqeCHafQQ — Robin Grammer (@RobinGrammer) August 11, 2025 Goldman's Wei warned clients: \"Most US regional markets remaining critically tight through 2030.\" \"Since we published on the US peak summer power market tightening, solid power demand growth further fueled by heatwaves has significantly tightened multiple regional markets, especially PJM (Mid-Atlantic), where power demand and prices have reached record-highs,\" the analyst said. Wei outlined three contributing factors to power market tightening: Solid power demand growth, which remains the most important factor impacting all regional markets, Insufficient renewable and natural gas power build-up to offset scheduled coal retirements, and Power storage and other newer technologies remaining too limited to fill the gap. What a mess. Green energy policies purged grids of stable coal power generation. Back to the epicenter of the power crisis. Marylanders are not thrilled about the power bill hyperinflation. And the power bill crisis is tanking the ratings of the far-left Maryland Governor Wes Moore and the Democratic Party in Annapolis. Folks are mad. This will only worsen. Like Goldman, our view is that the power bill crisis cycle is just in the early innings. Just wait until this winter in the Mid-Atlantic. And just like that, the rush to \"go green\" to save the planet from a manufactured crisis - merely a marketing and PR ploy by Democrats for fundraising - has led to mismanaged grids nationwide, now dangerously teetering on the verge of becoming third-world, like Cuba, with constant rolling blackout threats. Somewhat good news: President Trump has been proactive, issuing an order to delay the retirement of coal-fired power plants and boosting investments in nuclear power. Timestamp.
