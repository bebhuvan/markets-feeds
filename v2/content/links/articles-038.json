    "summary": "Sinem Hacioglu-Hoke, Leo Feler, and Jack ChylakUsing zip-code median income as a proxy for household income is common in economics but can mask heterogeneity and yield misleading conclusions. Using zip-code median income and self-reported household incomes from a representative panel of 150,000 U.S. households, we decompose average retail spending for 2018-2024. When using self-reported incomes, we observe substantial divergence in spending between low- and high-income households starting in mid-2021. When using zip-code aggregates as a proxy, this divergence disappears. Our findings indicate a 35 to 75 percent discrepancy between zip-code aggregates and self-reported incomes, highlighting the limitation of zip-code aggregates as a proxy for household incomes.",

    "summary": "Oleg SokolinskiyThis paper estimates trading costs in the off-the-run Treasury market using comprehensive transactions data and machine learning techniques. The analysis reveals several key findings that enhance the understanding of the off-the-run Treasury market liquidity. First, the indicative bid-ask spread is shown to be a biased measure of liquidity, even when not considering transaction volume. Specifically, bid-ask spreads systematically overstate trading costs of more seasoned Treasuries, and the liquidity of benchmark, on-the-run securities affects how off-the-run bid-ask spreads map to trading costs. Second, the paper demonstrates that trading costs may scale non-monotonically with transaction volume, which suggests selective, opportunistic liquidity-taking. Additionally, transaction size has greater effect on off-the-run securities’ trading costs when benchmark, on-the-run liquidity is lower. Finally, indicative bid-ask spreads may notably overstate trading costs for larger",

    "summary": "Shantanu Banerjee, Paul Cordova, Michiel De Pooter, and Olesya V. GrishchenkoWe apply natural language processing tools to news articles in the financial press to construct a sentiment index—an index of the perceived semantic orientation of monetary policy communications around scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. To that end, we develop several dictionaries that capture various monetary policy tools: conventional monetary policy, asset purchases, and forward guidance. The surprises in the sentiment index around FOMC meetings announcements explain variation in major asset prices classes between May 1999 and November 2022. Sentiment index surprises are important for explaining the variation in asset prices beyond monetary policy surprises.",

    "summary": "Eric EngstromAmid ongoing trade policy shifts and geopolitical uncertainty, concerns about stagflation have reemerged as a key macroeconomic risk. This paper develops a probabilistic framework to estimate the likelihood of stagflation versus soft landing scenarios over a four-quarter horizon. Building on Bekaert, Engstrom, and Ermolov (2025), the model integrates survey forecasts, structural shock decomposition, and a non-Gaussian BEGE-GARCH approach to capture time-varying volatility and skewness. Results suggest that the probability of stagflation was elevated at around 30 percent in late 2022, while the chance of a soft landing was below 5 percent. As inflation moderated and growth remained strong through 2024, these probabilities reversed. However, by mid-2025, renewed tariff concerns drove stagflation risk back up and the probability of a soft landing lower. These shifts highlight the potential value of distributional forecasting for policymakers and market participants navigating",

This is the premise of my upcoming book, The Wealth Ladder, which comes out in 2 weeks. The core idea: the strategy that got you to one point in your financial life may not get you to the next. This is true whether you're trying to build wealth or simply earn more. Too often we get stuck in the same routines while expecting different results. But, when it comes to making more without working more, the answer isn't necessarily to work harder, but to work differently.

    "summary": "- by New Deal democratLast month the new orders components of the economically weighted ISM manufacturing and services indexes warranted the hoisting of a yellow flag “Recession Watch.” This month that continued.To recap, because manufacturing is much less important to the economy than in the decades before the Millennium, the economically weighted average of the ISM services index (75%) as well as manufacturing (25%), especially over a three month period, has been much more accurate since 2000.Last week the ISM manufacturing index for June came in at 49.0, and its three month average was 48.7. The new orders subindex came in at 46.4, and its three month average was 47.1. On Thursday the non-manufacturing index was reported at 54.2, and the new orders index at 51.3. The three month average for the headline index was 52.6, and for new orders 50.0.Here is the manufacturing and services numbers for the past three years:The economically weighted average for the month of June alone is 52.9,",

This does not feel expected or normal.One of my favorite exercises is to play out scenarios - what would you have expected to happen if a particular event occurred, and then examine the reality. No one would have expected the current outcome.
