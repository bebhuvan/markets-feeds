    "fullContent": "The Global Inflation Outlook After the policy prescriptions surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused accelerated inflation all over the world, what do those numbers look like in 2025? Statista's Katharina Buchholz reports that, according to the International Monetary Fund, inflation is projected to remain elevated significantly above the recommended 2 percent in much of the world even this year. This is despite the fact that 30 countries are expected to have returned to target inflation between 2022 and the end of 2025, including many in Western Europe. Inflation meanwhile stayed elevated in parts of Africa, the Americas - including in the United States -, Asia and Oceania. While eastern Europe recovered slightly, Russia and its neighbors are seeing inflation pressures that are not subsiding as the war in Ukraine continues. You will find more infographics at Statista After the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, the IMF measured inflation of 7.3 percent for developed countries and 9.5 percent for developing nations that year. In 2025, this is projected to have decreased to 2.5 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. Due to eastern European inflation remaining high, emerging Europe is driving inflation here at 13.5 percent, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa at 13.3 percent as well as the Middle East and Central Asia at 11.1 percent. In many nations, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine is only a continuation of inflation pressures brought about by government interventions surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, when disrupted global supply chains caused inflation to soar. Because many developing nations are experiencing economic growth, inflation is generally higher on average in this group of countries. But this doesn't mean that inflation cannot hit non-industrialized countries hard if it happens at a time when their economies are struggling. Countries experiencing conflict, upheaval or major economic problems are expected to see inflation rates far above the global average. Among them are Venezuela, Sudan, Zimbabwe, South Sudan and Iran, which will see the highest rates overall (of between 43 percent and 180 percent). Countries that have long struggled with inflation issues, like Turkey and Argentina, are also continuing to see inflation upwards of 35 percent per year. Nations where inflationary pressure increase significantly in the past three years include Nigeria, Egypt, Bolivia, Myanmar and Burundi. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 04:15",

    "fullContent": "US, Gulf Tie Lebanon Reconstruction Funds To Total Hezbollah Disarmament Via The Cradle Lebanon is under pressure from the US and Gulf nations to completely disarm Hezbollah in exchange for loans and investments needed to rebuild the country following a devastating war with Israel last year, Bloomberg reported Saturday. US President Donald Trump has presented Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam with recommendations for dismantling the group, according to Tom Barrack, the US envoy to the country. Barrack said the US has told Aoun it is willing to serve as an intermediary if he moves to disband Hezbollah. Source: AFP At the same time, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait have told President Aoun and Prime Minister Salam that “funds for reconstruction and investment in Lebanon are contingent upon a timetable-bound plan to fully disarm Hezbollah,” Bloomberg wrote, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter. US envoy Barrack also emphasized that disarming and dismantling Hezbollah, the Shia resistance movement that has defended the country from Israel for decades, is the key to unlocking Gulf funding. “Gulf countries have said, ‘if you do these things, we will come to the south of Lebanon, and we will fund an industrial zone, renovation, and jobs,’” he said. Much of southern Lebanon was destroyed by relentless Israeli bombing during the two-month war last fall. Prime Minister Salam has asked the Lebanese military to present a plan by the end of August to dismantle all non-state armed groups by the end of the year. Hezbollah issued a statement on Wednesday saying it would not respect the government’s demand that it disarm. The group accused Salam of committing a “grave sin” by pursuing a “surrender strategy” amid “ongoing Israeli aggression and occupation.” Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem said Tuesday that Hezbollah “won’t engage on disarmament just because the US or a certain Arab country is seeking and applying all the pressure it can muster.” During a cabinet session earlier this week, Lebanese Minister of Labor Mohammad Haidar spoke against US envoy Barrack’s proposal to disarm Hezbollah. “I am one of the people – how can I face the mother of a martyr or a young man living in existential anxiety and tell him he must give up the only guarantee that protects him?” Haidar stated. He emphasized that any discussion of Hezbollah giving up its weapons is premature without Israel’s withdrawal, the return of prisoners, an end to attacks, and a serious reconstruction process. ⚡️ Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem: \"We don't accept to be slaves to anyone, neither to America nor to some Arab countries nor to anyone in the world... Either Lebanon, all of Lebanon, will come out victorious, or all of Lebanon will lose.\" pic.twitter.com/vn9R8gf4SO — COMBATE |🇵🇷 (@upholdreality) August 5, 2025 Despite the ceasefire reached between Israel and Hezbollah in November last year, Israel continues to occupy five positions inside Lebanon and regularly bombs Lebanese territory, killing dozens. On Thursday, an Israeli strike targeted a vehicle in eastern Lebanon near the Masnaa border crossing with Syria, killing five people. Among the dead was Mohammed Wishah, a member of the central committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and his bodyguard. Another drone strike the same day killed a Lebanese civilian in the town of Kfar Dan, west of Baalbek. The Israeli air force bombed 10 sites in south Lebanon the day before, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA). Tyler Durden Mon, 08/11/2025 - 03:30",
