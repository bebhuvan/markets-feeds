    "fullContent": "Trump Orders New Census To Fix 2020's Rigged-Count Favoring Democrats Authored by Matt Margolis via PJ Media, President Trump is putting America first again. This time, he’s going after the rigged system that counts illegal aliens in the U.S. Census, skewing congressional representation and rewarding sanctuary states with more power. On Thursday, Trump announced he’s directing the Department of Commerce to conduct a new, corrected census - one that actually counts American citizens and excludes those here illegally. “I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,” Trump announced in a post on Truth Social. “People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Naturally, the mainstream media isn’t thrilled. CNN described Trump’s proposal as “a dramatic shift from longstanding census practices” while insisting that the census “has historically counted all residents regardless of immigration status.” But, this is hardly just about illegal immigration. In fact, this move is long overdue. The 2020 Census, overseen by the Biden administration and its Deep State allies, was an unmitigated disaster - and the fallout is still being felt. Even the Census Bureau itself - hardly a bastion of conservative thought - admitted that its 2020 Census was incorrect in at least 14 states. According to the Bureau’s own Post-Enumeration Survey (PES), eight states were overcounted while six were undercounted. But here’s where it gets truly absurd: The Census Bureau claims it can’t identify which groups were miscounted or where the errors occurred, citing “sample sizes within most states do not support such estimates.” Translation? They know it was wrong, but they can’t — or won’t — say how or where. This isn’t just bureaucratic bungling; it’s a dereliction of duty. And it’s exactly why President Trump is right to call for a new, citizen-focused census. If the federal government can’t even tell us who they miscounted or where, how can anyone trust the results? These weren’t random clerical errors, either. They were systemic failures that just so happened to benefit Democrats. Florida was robbed of not one, but two congressional seats. Texas lost out on another. Meanwhile, blue states like Minnesota and Rhode Island held onto seats they should have lost — and Colorado was gifted a seat it was never entitled to. The fix was in. The Heritage Foundation: To put the scope of these mistakes into perspective, contrast the errors in the Census Bureau’s latest recount (the 2020 Post-Enumeration Survey, or PES) with the recount from a decade ago (the 2010 Post-Enumeration Survey)—in which there was a net overcount of a mere 0.01 percent (36,000 people), a statistically insignificant error. “The harms flowing from these mistakes impact more than just congressional representation, which also affects the number of electors from those states since they are calculated by the number of Senators and Representatives in each state,” explains the Heritage Foundation. “Because the Treasury and other federal departments will continue to use the original, official Census numbers (and not the new numbers contained in the PES), these errors will affect $1.5 trillion in funding received by states in federal appropriations during the next decade in disbursements that are distributed based on the population of each state. When the system cheats the American people, someone must blow the whistle. President Trump’s new census directive takes on the rigged counting of illegal aliens that the mainstream media buries.

    "fullContent": "Israel To Take Control Of All Of Gaza, But Netanyahu Claims Not Forever There have been reports all week which have said that Israel is now intent on conquering and occupying the whole of the Gaza Strip, and when asked about it Tuesday Presdient Trump responded, \"It is going to be pretty much up to Israel.\" In a fresh Thursday report, Axios writes that Trump \"does not oppose Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to launch a new military operation to occupy the entire Gaza Strip, U.S. and Israeli officials say.\" There's been some nuance in Netanyahu's position, however, as he's sought to distance himself from claims that he's planning a permanent occupation by Israeli forces. Source: Israeli army via Reuters \"We intend to,\" Netanyahu affirmed to Fox News when asked if he aims to take over the whole the strip. But then he said it would eventually be given over to a responsibly governing entitiy. \"We don’t want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We don’t want to govern it. We don’t want to be there as a governing body,\" he said. Also, Netanyahu's office has told Axios, \"We are not willing to remain in the current limbo and we are not willing to surrender to Hamas' demands — so essentially only one option is left, to take a drastic step. This is the last card we have left.\" Critics and skeptics have said Israel has long been deceptive at many points about its war aims. The whole counter-Hamas operation was launched with limited goals initially articulated, centered on taking out Hamas leadership and gaining the liberation of all captives - but the scope of operations have clearly shifted and been extended. Military leadership has taken a more cautious approach, warning that efforts to permanently control Gaza would be falling into a \"trap\" - as we reported earlier. Kan News public broadcaster previously stated \"The prime minister's direction is to go and conquer the Gaza Strip.\" The Israeli military's (IDF) chief of staff, Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir, has argued in a closed-door cabinet meeting that this \"will significantly endanger their lives and cause the army to burn out.\" Aerial view showing utter destruction of the Gaza Strip... The past year has seen Netanyahu clarify to political allies and opponets alike that he's opting for a military solution. Criticis have said he's putting the remaining hostages in danger. As for what group might one day take over, it is entirely doubtul that any Palestinian body - such as the Palestinian Authority - will actually be allowed to step in and govern by Israel. This is indeed a recipe for permanent occupation and annexation. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 15:05",

    "fullContent": "Trump Admin Throws Maryland Democrats A Lifeline To Halt Power Blackout Threat After Green Policies Backfire Maryland Governor Wes Moore and the Democratic Party in Annapolis have managed to spark a 'manufactured power crisis' in the Mid-Atlantic state through failed green energy policies, which have driven power bill costs up more than 1,000% over several years and are now financially crushing working-class households and mom and pop businesses. The Democrats' promise of a progressive 'utopia' in the imploding state has failed to materialize - and frankly, never will. Now, the Trump administration is throwing Governor Moore and the far-left Democrats, who are running the state into the ground, a massive lifeline to prevent a power grid collapse in the Baltimore region. According to Fox Baltimore reporter Gary Collins, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has granted a 90-day emergency waiver allowing the H.A. Wagner power plant to exceed pollution limits to avoid rolling blackouts in the Baltimore metro area. Traditionally coal-fired, but also capable of burning oil and natural gas, the Wagner power plant is owned and operated by Talon Energy and is located near Curtis Bay, Maryland. It provides hundreds of megawatts, playing a key role in supplying on-demand baseload power to Baltimore Gas & Electric (BG&E) Zone, part of the PJM Interconnection grid (Goldman spotted this power crisis from a mile away). Democrats who run the state have placed strict pollution controls on the Wagner power due to its coal usage, often reaching emissions caps during peak demand hours. Trump's lifeline for Democrats will help prevent rolling blackouts - like a third-world country - that would ultimately spark more doom for Gov. Moore's 2028 presidential ticket - if he ever had one. But apparently he does, because the Democratic Party has fired up its NGO complex and has been buying air time on local radio stations - and one state lawmaker told us the propaganda has shifted to purchasing social media influencers, all to quell growing dissent as the power bill crisis crushes everyone. We no longer need to explain how Maryland is becoming the epicenter of the Democratic Party's imploding policies - all on display for the nation to see, especially on the green issue. \"Another Reason To Leave\": Top Maryland Power Official Warns Of Regular Rolling Blackouts Maryland Democrats Scramble As Green Energy Agenda Sparks Power Bill Hyperinflation Democrats Spark \"Manufactured Power Crisis\" In Maryland As Left Begins To Panic \"You're Welcome\": Pennsylvania Boasts About Saving 'Green' Maryland From Near Power Grid Collapse Far-Left Panic: Dark Money NGO Floods Baltimore Airwaves With Propaganda To Save Governor Maryland must undergo an urgent course correction on its power grid policies or face a harsh winter of darkness.

Photo released by Netanyahu’s office. AIPAC Tracker, a group that tracks donations to US lawmakers from pro-Israel lobby groups, identified 20 House GOP members from a picture posted online by Netanyahu’s office. US House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) is also in Israel this week and visited illegal Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including one where he dined with Netanyahu. According to Punchbowl News, about 20 House Democrats are also headed to Israel during the recess on an AIPAC-sponsored trip. The strong show of support for Israel from so many US lawmakers comes as Israel is regularly massacring over 100 Palestinians a day in Gaza, including many desperate people seeking aid, and Palestinians are starving to death in Gaza every day due to the US-backed Israeli blockade.
