For me, it's the pool.Each year, I spend about 60 nights in hotel rooms — but I'll only book a stay after I've scanned a property's website and socials to confirm it has a pool that looks like the epitome of relaxation.Honestly, I care about having a pool more than I do a great view from my room or a rainfall shower. I love swimming, and I'm even happir when I can enjoy comfy lounge chairs and poolside service between dips.Such lounging is exactly what ",

Revenue rose 9.6% to $94 billion in the period, which ended June 28, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts estimated $89.3 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple had projected a $900 million headwind from tariffs during the period, saying that revenue would grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Though US tariffs are still expected to weigh on results in the long run, they likely provided a boon to Apple in the latest period — with consumers rushing to stores to get out ahead of expected price increases. The company also has been staging a comeback in China, a market where local phone brands have made inroads with consumers.

There will likely be payback in the July report, and it is possible we will see a seasonally adjusted decline in state and local education of 50 thousand or more for July. From Goldman Sachs: We forecast a 100k increase in payrolls in July. Big data indicators point to a rebound in private sector job growth, though to a still soft pace. ... We expect the unemployment rate to rebound to 4.2% based on the signal from other measures of labor market slack such as continuing jobless claims.emphasis addedFrom BofA: July NFP are likely to rise by 60k.
