    "summary": "The Government Is Not Your Friend Authored by 'Shinobi' via BitcoinMagazine.com, This week’s guilty verdict for Roman Storm on the count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money service business is absolutely insane.",
    "fullContent": "The Government Is Not Your Friend Authored by 'Shinobi' via BitcoinMagazine.com, This week’s guilty verdict for Roman Storm on the count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money service business is absolutely insane. FinCEN, the regulator responsible for licensing, monitoring, and enforcement actions concerning criminal activity in money transmission has itself explicitly stated that self-custodial tooling that facilitates the transmission of value using cryptocurrencies are not money transmitters and are not subject to the relevant regulations. So, how did we get here? Eight months after the election of a president who describes himself as a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency advocate, after the Department of Justice themselves have explicitly stated that they are not going to engage in regulation by prosecution, or prosecute mixing services, how was Roman Storm found guilty? There is nothing to describe this situation except pure, unbridled insanity. Incoherence. Hypocrisy and contradiction. There is a lesson here, though, one that I think it’s time more people in this space learn. The government’s word is worthless. It means nothing. They will continue cracking down on privacy, they will continue pushing KYC surveillance through things like the GENIUS Act and through the backdoor, applying them to just stablecoins (for now). They will continue treating the desire for privacy as evidence of criminal intent. They will do all these things while talking out of the other side of their mouth about supporting Bitcoiners and the “importance of self custody.” This is what the government does. This is what politicians do. It is inherent in their very nature. We need to stop treating these people as our friends. We need to stop pretending and lying to ourselves that they can be won over and become powerful allies to push the values and tools that we wish to see in the world. They are not our friends. They will not become allies, sharing a common cause with us. They are our enemies. It is time to stop pretending. These people must be treated as hostile, and dealt with as such. We need to stop begging them for clauses and riders in bills. We need to take them to court. We need to stop kissing their ass and pandering to their egos and notion of public persona. We need to call them out as the two-faced spineless people they are. If there is any legitimacy whatsoever to the legal foundations of the United States government, we do not need new laws, we do not need these people’s permission — we have the Constitution. Remind them of that in court. If, at the end of all of that, this system is so corrupt and hypocritical that it functionally ignores the constitutional rights of Americans (and non-Americans), then we need to ignore them. Civil disobedience is the last mechanism we have to hold the government accountable to the foundational constraints they are built upon short of violence. It is time to use it. Free human beings do not ask for their freedom; they take it. In a digital age creeping ever closer to Orwellian totalitarianism, that is the only way you will ever attain it. * * * Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ZeroHedge.

Japan and South Korea come in second place, with its citizens able to visit 190 countries, followed by EU countries Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Denmark and Spain in joint third, with access to 189 countries. As Statista's Anna Fleck reports, even though the United States is a little further down the list, coming in 10th place, it still yields considerable power, enabling citizens to enter 182 countries without major restrictions. It’s a level of freedom also enjoyed by passport holders in Lithuania and Iceland. You will find more infographics at Statista At the other end of the scale, the situation is very different. For passport holders in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, for example, travel is much more restrictive. The Afghan passport wields the least power of the ranking, with just 25 destinations permissible visa-free. The situation in Syria and Iraq isn’t much better, at 27 and 30 destinations, respectively. The Henley Passport Index draws from data from the International Air Transport Authority (IATA), including 199 different passports and 227 different travel destinations.

    "fullContent": "Three Years Later, The American People Deserve The Truth About Mar-a-Lago Raid Authored by Julie Kelly via declassified.live, No photo other than his mugshot is more representative of the unprecedented lawfare against Donald Trump than the photo of alleged classified documents discovered during the nine-hour armed raid of Mar-a-Lago on August 8, 2022. On one hand, Democrats, the news media, and even some NeverTrumpers (clears throat, side-eyes National Review) believed the iconic picture proved Trump had absconded with secret government records and carelessly left them around his Palm Beach mansion, endangering national security. Trump supporters, on the other hand, viewed the photo with disgust, a reminder of just how far the Biden regime and his FBI would go to finally put Trump in handcuffs. But nearly two years later, the same Department of Justice that added the picture to a 2022 court filing for the sole purpose of ginning up media coverage, which worked like a charm, finally admitted the photo was staged. The stunt was revealed during court proceedings last year in southern Florida in the so-called documents case. (How is it only a year ago?) In response to Trump’s accusations the FBI mishandled items taken from his home that infamous day, the DOJ—in the hands of Special Counsel Jack Smith by then—confessed FBI agents brought the colorful classified cover sheets to Mar-a-Lago. At first, Smith said the FBI used the sheets only as “placeholders” indicating where the alleged illegal files had been found. But he finally had to fess up: “As part of the processing of seized documents marked classified, the [evidence response team] photographed the documents (with appropriate cover sheets added by FBI personnel) next to the box in which they were located,” Smith wrote in a June 2024 brief. But nowhere did the cover sheets indicate the attached files were evidence. In other words, the photo not only misrepresented the condition in which “classified documents” were found but proved that agents had tampered with the president’s belongings—consisting of evidence in the case—in preparation for a publicity stunt. As Judge Aileen Cannon continued to let Smith’s team hang themselves in court hearings and briefs—she also had just busted Bratt for lying about the condition of all the evidence seized that day—the scandal became moot in July 2024 when she dismissed the case after determining Smith’s appointment violated the Constitution. And after Trump won the election, the entire case, at least in court, became moot for good. A Dangerous Raid, Fake Cover Sheets, and a Corrupt Prosecution But it is not, and should not be, moot for the president, his family, and the American people. While the optics of the raid made for must-watch cable news coverage, the raid itself posed a danger to individuals, including Secret Service agents and Mar-a-Lago employees, since more than two dozen FBI agents arrived armed without identification early that morning. Further, as I broke on May 22, 2024, Chris Wray’s FBI had authorized the use of lethal force; routine or not, no such policy should have been included, or even considered, as part of the unprecedented search of a former president. Agents rummaged through the personal belongings of Melania and Barron Trump in potential violation of the broad search warrant terms. In her 2024 autobiography, Mrs. Trump described how she felt afterwards: “I never imagined such an invasion of privacy and violation of rights could occur in my adoptive country,” she wrote in comparing the Biden regime’s tactics to those of her native Slovenia. “It was with a tremendous sense of sadness that I realized such unlawful acts were now possible here. Americans need to understand the dangers posed by a federal government that feels entitled to invade our homes and our lives.” The ensuing investigation involved more egregious violations of privacy. The FBI obtained an extensive trove of surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago; the Trump-hating chief judge of the D.C. District Court pierced attorney-client privilege between the president and his lawyer in the matter by claiming they were covering up a potential crime. The lawyer, Evan Corcoran, was forced to turn over private documents and testify before a grand jury. Luckily, it appears payback is in progress; recent reporting suggests the FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago could constitute a seminal event in the “grand conspiracy” investigation announced this week by Attorney General Pam Bondi. Trump allies for years have speculated the purpose of the raid, ordered by then Attorney General Merrick Garland, was to retrieve documents related to the Russiagate hoax, the subject of the DOJ’s current conspiracy probe. “Why was there a raid at Mar-a-Lago?” Devin Nunes, former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who blew the lid off the Russiagate hoax back in 2018, rhetorically asked during a Fox News interview last month. “What led to that raid? What led to the appointment of that special counsel? What the hell were they doing at Mar-a-Lago, what were they looking for?” Good questions that demand answers. The raid, after all, not only represented more fruit of the poisonous Russiagate tree but also another manufactured crime against the president: the “willful retention of national defense material.” Another Bogus ‘Crime’ With Same Agenda When Jack Smith announced his 38-count indictment against Trump and two aides in June 2023, the special counsel took on a dire tone. “The men and women of the United States intelligence community and our armed forces dedicate their lives to protecting our nation and its people,” Smith said in a public statement. “Our laws that protect national defense information are critical to the safety and security of the United States and they must be enforced. Violations of those laws put our country at risk.” Smith, however, never proved anything of the sort. To the contrary, Smith only proved his feckless team of Trump-hating thugs botched evidence, misled and routinely disrespected Judge Cannon—who at one point threatened to remove David Harbach, the other lead prosecutor in the case, from her courtroom for his bad behavior—and admitted the government had no evidence the boxes that had been moved around Mar-a-Lago, the basis for obstruction charges, contained any of the alleged “classified” files. Additionally, emails showed how the Biden DOJ had been in cahoots with the National Archives and the Biden White House for months to concoct the documents case, as I covered here, in what eerily mirrors facets of what we now know happened in the Obama White House in 2016. (With at least one of the same players, Lisa Monaco, involved in both.) Trump officials are in the process of bringing some accountability; firings of agents, investigators, and prosecutors who participated in the case remain ongoing. But the American people—and the Trumps—deserve a full accounting of the truth. As Mrs. Trump said in her book, “the possibility of similar abuses occurring domestically demands our attention and action, as we must safeguard our liberties before they are lost forever.” Bravo.

    "fullContent": "\"Manipulative Activist-Journalism\": Seattle Immigrant Coverage Goes From Journalism Into Criminal Advocacy Seattle’s KING 5 News, once known for championing social justice causes during the height of the BLM movement, appears to have found a new mission: reshaping public perception of illegal immigration and criminal justice—sometimes at the expense of context, facts, and, frankly, journalistic integrity. In a recent op-ed, Seattle-based commentator Jason Rantz called out the station for what he described as “manipulative activist-journalism,” pointing to a report by KING 5’s Sharon Yoo that profiles convicted felon Kimlis Tek, who now faces deportation after serving 15 years in prison. At the center of the controversy is Yoo’s framing of Tek as a tragic figure—a man caught in the so-called “DOC-to-ICE pipeline,” subjected to “double punishment” by the U.S. immigration system. But as Rantz notes, this sympathetic portrayal leaves out key facts that paint a very different picture. Yoo reportedly refers to Tek’s conviction as merely “assault,” a word that, stripped of detail, could mean anything from a bar fight to a shove on the street. But the court records, as Rantz outlines, tell a far more brutal story. Tek Tek was convicted of slashing his wife with a military-style, 7.5-inch knife, causing a gaping six-inch wound that severed muscle, required 28 staples, and left her with a permanent scar, Rantz writes. He didn’t stop there—he also violated a no-contact order, called her over 40 times, and attempted to manipulate her into skipping trial and lying on his behalf. Yet, as Rantz rightly asks, “The idea that this was simply ‘assault’ is journalistically negligent—or purposefully deceptive.” Yoo’s report allegedly centers the pain of Tek’s family while omitting nearly every detail of his victim’s experience. The scar, the trauma, the long rehabilitation—it’s all missing. Instead, viewers are fed a narrative that leans heavily into emotion and avoids the full truth. Why? Because telling the full story would make it harder to present Tek as the poster child for the “double punishment” debate—a term activists use to argue that deporting someone after they serve time is excessive. But here’s the rub: that’s how the law works. “If you’re a green card holder or here illegally and you commit violent felonies, you don’t get to stay,” Rantz writes. “That’s not some racist policy—it’s a basic standard of public safety.” And he’s right. Public safety matters. If someone is convicted of a violent felony, especially against a domestic partner, and repeatedly shows contempt for the court system, why should they get a second shot at living in the country whose laws they violated? Rantz This is where KING 5 crosses the line—from informing the public to influencing it. This isn’t just a one-off, either. Rantz points out that Yoo’s past stories follow a pattern: immigrants framed as victims, ICE as the villain, and criminal behavior either downplayed or skipped entirely. KING 5’s “Facing Race” series, once focused on highlighting racial disparities, now seems to be pushing a broader activist agenda—this time for open-border proponents. It’s less about race, more about resistance: resistance to deportation, to immigration enforcement, and to any narrative that doesn’t paint law enforcement as the bad guys. And while advocacy has its place in public discourse, journalism—especially on a major local broadcast station—should strive for balance. Omitting the disturbing facts of a violent crime while spotlighting tears from the convict’s relatives doesn’t inform the public; it manipulates them. There’s a real debate to be had about immigration, second chances, and rehabilitation. But those conversations need to be grounded in facts—not selective storytelling designed to evoke sympathy without accountability. If we’re going to talk about “double punishment,” we should also talk about double standards: one for everyday Americans who expect justice and safety, and another for convicted criminals framed as martyrs by activist-journalists. Because as Rantz puts it, “This isn’t journalism. It’s propaganda.” And audiences—no matter their politics—deserve better. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 22:10",

Then Rubio dropped a MASSIVE reveal: “For the first time… we have concrete examples of the kinds of things that Russia would ask for in order to end the war.” The news hit like a shockwave just before 3:30 p.m yesterday. Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s special envoy, had been in Moscow meeting with Vladimir Putin…but no one expected what came next. Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum broke the story live on air: “Thank you for being with us. We’ve got some breaking news we want to get to.” “We want to get this in, it’s a HUGE breaking story. President Trump reportedly set to meet face-to-face with Russian president Vladimir Putin as early as next week.” “This comes right off of Steve Witkoff’s meeting with Putin.” Was this be the beginning of a peace deal? According to Fox’s Peter Doocy, Putin didn’t just meet with Witkoff, but he gave him a direct message for Trump: he wants a sit-down. A face-to-face. Wow. “Earlier today in Moscow, Steve Witkoff was told by Vladimir Putin that Putin wants to meet at some point with Trump.” “Witkoff then relayed that message to the president who is open to it, the possibility of a meeting as soon as next week, if the result of that meeting will be an end to the war in Ukraine.” Doocy also said that Trump had already briefed Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and several European leaders during a phone call earlier in the day. “We know that President Trump was on a phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some European leaders. He shared this with all of them.” “We don’t know exactly where in the world that would be. It could be anywhere.” The stage was being set.

It was real and it was happening. Kudlow asked, “What can you tell us, Mr. Secretary?” Rubio laid it out: “Well, Steve went over to Moscow yesterday, Steve Witkoff—and had a productive meeting in terms of what was discussed, details that perhaps hadn’t been shared before in terms of ideas about how to bring this war to an end.” He doubled down on the administration’s sole objective: “Let’s remind everybody that’s the goal here, the president wants to end the war.” Rubio said that after getting the update, President Trump immediately looped in European leaders. “The president after getting that update today convened several leaders from Europe, updated them on what happened in ‘the talks.’” “We’re going to be having talks with our European allies and the Ukrainians as well over the next couple of days just to see what progress we can make on that side of it, and then hopefully, if things continue to progress an opportunity will present itself very soon for the president to meet both with Vladimir Putin and with President Zelensky at some point here, hopefully in the near future.” Rubio made it clear that they weren’t there yet….peace talks take time. “But obviously a lot has to happen before that can occur.” He explained that if the two sides can get close enough, he believes that there’s only one man that can get them both to sign: President Trump. “But I’ve always believed, I’ve always said this—I think the deal, there’s going to be a deal to end this war and it’ll have to require the president to come in at the end and close on it, as I’ve seen him do numerous times on trade deals as an example.” The question now is: how close can they get both sides?

Rubio confirmed that for the FIRST time, they now understand what Russia actually wants to end the war. “I think what we have is a better understanding of the conditions under which Russia would be prepared to end the war,” he said. The challenge now is bridging that gap. “We have to compare that to what the Ukrainians and our European allies are willing to accept.” “If we can get those two positions close enough… then I think there’s the opportunity for the president to have a meeting that includes both Putin and Zelenskyy to try to close this thing out.” He added, “For the first time, perhaps since this administration began, we have some concrete examples of the kinds of things that Russia would ask for in order to end the war.” Then he said what many had already been thinking: “We’ve got to bring the two sides and the positions close enough so that the ultimate closer, President Trump, can get involved and make it happen.” A deal might be closer than anyone expected.

But reporters weren’t focused on tech…they wanted to know about the potential peace summit. A reporter asked, “Have Putin and Zelensky agreed to a summit yet? And where and when would that be?” Trump didn’t dodge. He actually leaned in. “Well, there’s a ‘very good’ prospect that they will,” he said. He confirmed the ball was already rolling: “And we haven’t determined where, but he had some very good talks with President Putin today.” Then came the line that may define this moment: “There’s a very good chance that we could be ending the, ending the round.” Trump sees this as his shot to bring the war to a close. But his optimism is….cautious optimism. “The end to that road—that road was long and continues to be long, but there’s a good chance that there will be a meeting very soon.” When asked how close he thought a deal was, Trump didn’t want to overpromise. “Well, look—I don’t want to say. I’ve been disappointed before with this one.” This isn’t a man guessing. This is a man playing his cards close.

Did Vladimir Putin make some kind of concession that he hasn’t been willing to make before?” Trump wasn’t ready to call it a breakthrough, but he made one thing clear: this wasn’t sudden. This did not come out of thin air. It was planned. He’s been leveraging both sides for months. “I don’t call it a breakthrough. I mean, we’ve been working on this a long time.” He pointed to the human cost of delay. Truly tragic. “There are thousands of young people dying, mostly soldiers, but also, you know, missiles being hit into Kiev and other places. But in terms of soldiers, I think Russia’s lost over 20,000 since the beginning of the year. 20,000! And, I guess the estimate for Ukraine is about 9000.” “It’s a terrible situation and we want to get it stopped.” Then he revealed what’s been driving him all along. “You know, we don’t have American soldiers there, but I feel I have an obligation to get it stopped.” Trump made it clear: this isn’t his war. It started on someone else’s watch. “This was not my war. This war would have never started. Not even a chance. And it didn’t start for four years.” He spelled it out for the media in the room with him. “But this is Biden’s war. This was was, on his watch. And, you know, it’s funny. We had, no land was taken from Trump. It was taken from Bush, it was taken from Biden. The whole thing would take from Biden if it weren’t for us, but it was, and it was taken by Obama.” “Take a look at what was taken with all of the land that was taken. Nothing was taken by Russia from us. Not one ounce of land was taken.” Then he ended with a promise. “I’m here to get the thing over with. It would have never started if I were president. And we’re here to get it stopped and get the death stopped.” In his mind, he’s cleaning up a war that never would’ve happened if he were still in charge. And if this summit and eventual deal become a reality, it could mark one of the most biggest diplomatic breakthroughs in modern history…led by the man who says he feels “obligated” to bring peace. Then came the declaration. A reporter followed up: “What was the breakthrough today? Did Vladimir Putin make some kind of concession that he hasn’t been willing to make before?” Trump wasn’t ready to call it a breakthrough, but he made one thing clear: this wasn’t sudden.… pic.twitter.com/DqkICn0WYK — The Vigilant Fox 🦊 (@VigilantFox) August 7, 2025 Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 21:45",

    "fullContent": "'Far From Frantic': How Active Has The 2025 Atlantic Hurricane Season Been? Atlantic hurricane season officially spans from June to November, but only a sliver of total activity usually occurs before August. That makes early-season developments a useful pulse check on what may lie ahead. So far, as Visual Capitalist shows in the chart below, 2025’s pulse is steady but far from frantic. A Measured Start to 2025 The graphic above, created by USAFacts using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data, plots every Atlantic system since 2015 by the month it formed and the strongest category it reached. Green dots denote tropical storms, blue dots Category 1–2 hurricanes, and purple dots Category 3+ “major” hurricanes. So far in 2025, the dots are sparse: four storms, none exceeding tropical-storm strength. By early August a typical season averages three named storms, so this year is slightly ahead of the curve. That said, it’s far calmer than 2020, which was the early-season outlier. Below is a detailed look at every Atlantic storm (2015-2025) and its peak intensity: Storm Name Month Year Classification Andrea June 2025 Tropical storm Barry June 2025 Tropical storm Chantal July

county-level map below shades areas that have endured at least one bout of 39 mph winds since 2015. The deepest purples hug the Gulf Coast, Florida peninsula, and the Outer Banks, but inland regions from Georgia’s wiregrass to eastern North Carolina also light up, evidence that wind impacts reach far beyond shorelines. For perspective on how damaging these systems can be, see our ranking of the costliest hurricanes to hit the U.S. Looking Ahead Climatology shows the first hurricane typically spins up in early to mid-August, with major-category hurricanes following later that month. Warm sea-surface temperatures and a likely transition toward neutral ENSO conditions could still unlock the ingredients for rapid intensification. In short: a quiet opening is no guarantee of a quiet finish. As peak season approaches, preparedness remains key for coastal communities.

    "fullContent": "DOJ Moves To Unseal Exhibits From Epstein, Maxwell Grand Jury Investigations Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times, The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday asked a federal court to unseal grand jury exhibits from the investigations into sex traffickers Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. In a submission to U.S. District Judge Richard Berman and fellow U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer, the DOJ said it wants grand jury exhibits in the two cases unsealed with redactions to keep the identities of their victims private. Earlier this week, the DOJ asked the judges to unseal grand jury transcripts in order to compare those documents with the public record. “As there are parties whose names appear in the grand jury exhibits but did not appear in the grand jury transcripts, the Government is undertaking to notify such parties to the extent their names appear in grand jury exhibits that were not publicly admitted at the Maxwell trial (and they were not already notified in connection with the request to unseal the grand jury transcripts),” the Justice Department’s attorneys wrote. The latest request relates to the 2019 criminal case that was brought against Epstein, which was later dropped after he was found dead in a New York City jail cell, as well as the criminal case against Maxwell. She was convicted on child sex trafficking charges in 2021 and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence in a federal facility. Friday’s filing by the government also said that some of the evidence in the Epstein and Maxwell cases may overlap with exhibits that were released to the public when Maxwell went on trial. Also, the DOJ said that it will later submit sealed submissions to clarify what sections of the Epstein and Maxwell grand jury exhibits have already been made available to the public. The government has also compared the exhibits against the trial record and civil complaints that were filed by certain victims, the court filing said. It’s not clear what the exhibits may include or when they could be unsealed. The Epstein grand jury met twice in 2019, on June 18 and July 2 of that year, the DOJ letter said on Aug. 4. Meanwhile, the Maxwell grand jury met three times, on June 29 and July 8 of 2020, and on March 29, 2021, according to the letter. That letter had also asked for the release of the five grand jury transcripts and told the judges that the DOJ may also request the unsealing of grand jury exhibits. The agency said it wants several more days to craft arguments for that request. Epstein’s death was officially ruled a suicide by hanging. Previously, in 2008, Epstein was sentenced to 13 months in work custody for procuring a child for prostitution and sex trafficking. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 20:55",

    "fullContent": "Social Security Insolvency Projected 6 Months Sooner, Chief Actuary Says The Social Security trust funds are projected to run out about six months earlier than previously estimated, according to a new analysis from the program’s chief actuary. Letters sent on Aug. 5 to Sen. Ron Wyden (D‑Ore.) and Rep. Steven Horsford (D‑Nev.) say the combined Old‑Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) funds are now expected to be depleted in the first quarter of 2034, rather than the third quarter of that year as in the most recent trustees’ report. The 2025 trustees’ report, released in June, had already moved up the combined depletion date by one year—from 2035 in the prior report to 2034—reflecting worsening demographics and legislative changes. Under the new analysis carried out in response to requests from Wyden and Horsford, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act accelerates that timeline further by about six months. As Tom Ozimek reports for The Epoch Times, the actuary’s letter attributes the earlier depletion to income‑tax provisions in the law, which make lower tax rates enacted in 2017 permanent and temporarily expand deductions for older Americans. It estimates the changes will reduce revenue from taxing Social Security benefits and increase program costs by about $168.6 billion through 2034, worsening the program’s 75‑year actuarial deficit from 3.82 percent to 3.98 percent of taxable payroll. When viewed separately, the OASI fund—which pays retirement and survivor benefits—is now forecast to run dry in the fourth quarter of 2032, roughly three months earlier than the previous estimate of the first quarter of 2033. The DI fund, by contrast, remains solvent through the end of the 75-year forecast window. However, because the two funds are often assessed together to reflect total benefit obligations, the combined reserves are still expected to be exhausted by early 2034. The actuary’s office said the analysis covers only the tax‑related provisions and will serve as a baseline for the 2026 trustees’ report, which will incorporate updated data and assumptions. In particular, the forthcoming trustees’ report will also include proposals intended to extend the solvency of Social Security. Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the actuary’s findings confirm earlier warnings that recent Republican tax and spending policies are straining the program. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump administration has said its tax policy will stimulate economic growth and expand the tax base, mitigating the fiscal effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act without raising tax rates. A White House Council of Economic Advisers paper from May stated that the permanent extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and business incentives in the bill would boost capital investment, wages, and job growth, strengthening government revenue streams over time. Proposals to Shore Up the Program Democrats have largely focused on raising payroll taxes for higher earners to close the funding gap. The Social Security tax currently applies to 6.2 percent of wages up to $176,100 in 2025, and income above that level is exempt. The wage base is adjusted annually for inflation by the Social Security Administration. A proposal introduced in 2023 by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I‑Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D‑Mass.)—known as the Social Security Expansion Act—would apply the tax to earnings above $250,000 and boost benefits for some groups. Proponents say the measure would keep the program solvent through 2096, though conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation say that it would amount to one of the largest tax increases in U.S. history and risk broader economic harm. Republican plans have taken a different approach, focusing on changes to benefits and eligibility rather than new taxes. A blueprint released last spring by the Republican Study Committee—the largest group of conservatives in the House—called for gradually raising the retirement age, adjusting benefit formulas, and limiting certain spousal and dependent benefits for high‑income retirees. Some analysts, such as those at Brookings, have suggested that any lasting fix will likely require a mix of tax increases and benefit adjustments, phased in gradually to give workers and retirees time to plan. They note that previous solvency deals, such as the 1983 reforms, combined measures from both parties to extend the program’s life for decades. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 20:30",
