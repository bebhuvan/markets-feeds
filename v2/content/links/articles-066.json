    "fullContent": "Elon Musk Unveils Grok Update After Controversial Posts By The AI Chatbot Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday unveiled a new update to his Grok AI chatbot, a day after it posted controversial content across social media platform X. Elon Musk looks on during a news conference in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30, 2025. Allison Robbert/AFP via Getty Images Earlier this week, Grok 3 made allegedly anti-Semitic comments, cited what appeared to be false information about an X user in connection with the recent deadly floods in Texas, made statements praising Adolf Hitler, and at one point, described itself as “MechaHitler,” causing the term to trend on X on Tuesday. Musk’s xAI company, which develops the chatbot, released a statement Tuesday on the Grok account, saying it is “actively working to remove the inappropriate posts” and has “taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X.” “Grok 4 is the first time, in my experience, that an AI has been able to solve difficult, real-world engineering questions where the answers cannot be found anywhere on the Internet or in books. And it will get much better,” Musk wrote in a post on Thursday. In a livestreamed event, Musk also touted the capabilities of the latest Grok update, calling Grok 4 “the smartest AI in the world.” “It really is remarkable to see the advancement of artificial intelligence, how quickly it is evolving,” he said. “I would expect Grok to discover new technologies that are actually useful no later than next year, and maybe end of this year. And it might discover new physics next year.” Responding to the controversy over the recent posts, Musk said that the comments posted by Grok 3 earlier in the week were because the chatbot was “too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated.” “That is being addressed,” Musk wrote in a July 9 post on X. Musk last month promised to upgrade Grok, suggesting there was “far too much garbage in any foundation model trained on uncorrected data.” The announcement from Musk follows high-profile AI advancements that were released by Google, OpenAI, and other tech companies in recent months. Big tech companies have been spending heavily on AI as they view the new technology as a major growth engine, while slashing costs elsewhere to safeguard profits. Some current and former employees at OpenAI and Google warned in an open letter that “serious risks” could be posed by AI and called for greater protections. The letter warned that AI could lead to “the further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in human extinction.” During the Grok 4 launch, Musk briefly referred to AI safety and said that he wants Grok to be “maximally truth-seeking.” On Wednesday, X CEO Linda Yaccarino stepped down from the company, though there was no known connection between her decision and the content posted by Grok. She did not refer to the Grok controversy in her farewell statement, posted to her account. “I’m incredibly proud of the X team - the historic business turn around we have accomplished together has been nothing short of remarkable,” she wrote. Reuters contributed to this report. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 14:05",

    "fullContent": "Tom Lee's BitMine Holdings Top $3 Billion In Largest Global Ethereum Treasury Strategy Aside from Friday's sudden net outflow, the month of Ethereum's tenth anniversary was celebrated by an almost unstoppable wave of net inflows into ETFs... And, perhaps even more notably, an ongoing demand from Altcoin Treasury Strategy companies is also gaining momentum with Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) said its ether holdings have climbed to about 833,000 tokens currently worth more than $2.9 billion, making the Tom Lee–backed company the world’s largest public holder of ETH. Source: The Block Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, who is now the Chairman of BitMine’s board of directors, says the firm is pushing to acquire 5% of the circulating supply of Ethereum, which would be about 6,035,480 ETH. “BitMine moved with lightning speed in its pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH growing our ETH holdings to over 833,000 from zero 35 days ago. We have separated ourselves among crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high liquidity of our stock.” Ethereum is surging higher this morning on the heels of this news... Continuing its recent strong outperformance trend over bitcoin... As a reminder, Standard Chartered forecasts Ethereum Treasury holdings to top 10% of supply: For ETH this is likely to happen more quickly, as the broader concept of corporate holdings of digital assets is already accepted. Publicly listed Bitcoin mining company, BitMine Immersion Tech (BMNR), is currently the largest Ether treasury firm, holding 0.5% of the circulating ETH supply. If BMNR can achieve its goal of increasing its ETH holdings to 5% of the total in circulation, then it is fair to assume that ETH treasury companies as a whole will end up holding more than 10% of all ETH in circulation. This would be a 10x increase from today’s corporate treasury holdings. Ether-focused treasury firms have more growth potential compared to Bitcoin treasury firms from a “regulatory arbitrage perspective,” according to Standard Chartered. \"...this buying of digital assets by corporates makes sense due to inefficiencies in financial markets, mostly stemming from regulation. Specifically, restrictions on investor access to the asset class, which remain significant in a large number of jurisdictions, mean that investors seek alternative vehicles (in this case publicly listed companies) through which to gain exposure to the underlying asset. As a result, these companies’ market cap tends to trade above the net asset value (NAV) of the assets held, at a so-called positive NAV multiple.\" Ether treasury firms can “capture both staking rewards and decentralised finance (DeFi) leverage opportunities, which US Ethereum ETFs currently cannot.” In terms of next potential catalysts, we will be looking at the upcoming Fusaka protocol upgrade in Q4’25.

    "fullContent": "EPA's Lee Zeldin Defends Proposal To Repeal Climate Regulation Authored by Victoria Friedman via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin on Sunday defended plans to repeal the agency’s Obama-era “endangerment findings“ that link motor vehicle emissions to changes in the climate and underpin related regulations. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin attends a Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission Event in the East Room of the White House in Washington on May 22, 2025. Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo Zeldin told CNN’s “State of the Union” that to reach the 2009 endangerment findings, officials “relied on the most pessimistic views of the science.” He added that a lot of those views did not pan out and that his proposals “rely on 2025 facts, as opposed to 2009 bad assumptions.” On July 29, Zeldin proposed repealing the findings, saying during a visit to an auto dealership in Indiana that doing so would “end 16 years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers.” According to the EPA, if the proposal goes ahead, it would repeal $1 trillion in regulations, saving $54 billion annually. The plans followed Zeldin’s announcement in June that his administration would start relaxing Clean Power Plant greenhouse gas and mercury emission regulations, which were imposed under the Biden and Obama administrations. These regulations would have required power plants to “capture” 40 percent of their emissions by 2032 and increase that to 90 percent by 2039, which Zeldin said would cost coal- and gas-fired plants upward of $1 billion a year. Two Findings According to the EPA’s website, the agency relied on two findings—signed in December 2009 under a section of the Clean Air Act—to impose regulations on greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and other sectors. The first finding said “current and projected concentrations” of six well-mixed greenhouse gases—including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide—in the atmosphere threatened public health and welfare. The second found that the combined emissions from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contributed to greenhouse gas pollution. “These findings do not themselves impose any requirements on industry or other entities,” the EPA stated. “However, this action was a prerequisite for implementing greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and other sectors.” Zeldin told “State of the Nation” that previous government officials had made “a lot of mental leaps” in order to justify the findings. “They say carbon dioxide, when mixed with a whole bunch of other well-mixed gases, in some cases not even emitted from mobile sources ... contributes to global climate change. It doesn’t say causes, [it says] ‘contributes.’ How much, they don’t say, but it’s north of zero—not much more than zero,” Zeldin said. Vague Language Zeldin added that the EPA could not use vague language in statutes to make mandates, and that regulating “mobile sources” of pollution, such as automobiles, was a matter that would ultimately need to be addressed by Congress. “The power comes from the law. I don’t get to just make up the law,” he said. Zeldin added that for the United States to become the AI capital of the world, unleash energy dominance, bring down energy costs, and protect jobs, “we are not going to regulate out of existence entire sectors of our economy, and we are not going to interpret law in whichever vague, creative way allows us to give ourselves maximum power.” He said the agency’s plan is still just a proposal at this stage and will be open for public comment, with a final decision to follow after the comment period ends. Environmental groups have criticized the plans. The Environmental Defense Fund said on X last month that the proposal would “put millions in harm’s way,” calling it the administration’s “most environmentally destructive action yet.” The organization said that the EPA’s actions would lead to more pollution, stronger hurricanes, more powerful floods, and more frequent fires, as well as causing higher insurance and increasing fuel costs for Americans.

    "fullContent": "Stripper Index Doesn't Apply To Bitcoin, OnlyFans Models Say The \"stripper index” - an anecdotal measurement that connects economic health with spending on adult entertainment - appears unable to predict Bitcoin’s price. Only indicator that actually matters: if this breaks support, recession guaranteed pic.twitter.com/BgNlUv0grZ — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 8, 2025 As CoinTelegraph reports, Kodi Rose (guessing here, but that's probably not her real name), a self-described “dollar stripper” and adult content creator, alluded to these frontline insights in a recent viral TikTok video, saying she believes the economy is already in a recession as fewer customers are asking where they can “hit the slopes,” a social code for cocaine. The digital equivalent of exotic dancers is adult content creators, and OnlyFans dominates the space. On the platform, users subscribe to creators and tip for extras. Turns out the stripper index doesn’t really work for Bitcoin. A 57-month revenue analysis of one mid-tier OnlyFans creator shows a negative correlation with Bitcoin’s price, despite the two moving in the same direction more than half the time. To understand whether creators’ income holds any predictive value for Bitcoin, Cointelegraph spoke to veterans in the adult entertainment industry who’ve weathered both its ups and downs alongside crypto’s hype cycles. Bitcoin followed OnlyFans model’s earnings 55% of the time The stripper index is backed by the assumption that consumers will cut down on non-essential spending during economic downturns. “Sex work is considered a ‘non-essential’ service — it’s entertainment, a luxury. Therefore, it’s one of the first expenses people cut when their financial situation becomes uncertain or they anticipate economic instability,” Catherine De Noire, an OnlyFans creator and brothel manager, told Cointelegraph. Alana Nguyen, who performs on OnlyFans under the stage name “Nerdy Dancing,” shared her monthly earnings with Cointelegraph since moving online after the 2020 pandemic shut down of the physical world, including strip clubs. So far, she hasn’t noticed any clear correlation between crypto prices and subscriber behavior. Nguyen’s revenue before taxes and expenses, but after a 20% cut to OnlyFans. Source: Nerdy Dancing “Even if there are global economic conditions affecting overall spending, I don’t think crypto prices correlate strongly with my earnings,” Nguyen told Cointelegraph. A Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.335 over 57 months suggests a moderately negative linear relationship between Nguyen’s earnings and Bitcoin’s price. A 10-month rolling Pearson correlation between Nguyen’s earnings and Bitcoin’s price showed considerable volatility over time. The highest correlation was observed in the 10-month period ending July 2021, which were the first months of Nguyen’s business. Out of 48 total calculations, the rolling correlation coefficient was evenly split, with 24 positive and 24 negative values, suggesting the relationship between Nguyen’s earnings and Bitcoin’s price fluctuated without a consistent pattern. The rolling correlation rarely went above 0.5 or below -0.5, indicating low correlation. Each 10-month window contains a small sample size, so these results should be viewed as indicative rather than statistically conclusive. In a separate measurement, Cointelegraph analyzed whether or not Nguyen’s earnings rose when Bitcoin’s monthly average rose compared to the previous month and when her revenue dropped as Bitcoin dropped. In this measurement, the two moved toward the same direction almost half the time, with 55% accuracy over 57 months. “I’ve always thought concepts like the stripper index are only useful in terms of aggregate spending. Even in the strip club, my earnings aren’t necessarily tied to how the club is doing overall. It’s more about my personal selling ability that day — whether regulars come in or I get lucky with a big spender,” Nguyen said. OnlyFans is notorious for opaque financial reporting. One website, OnlyGuider, claims to have analyzed the transaction behavior of over 1 million subscribers and found that the top 0.1% of creators earn the majority of the platform’s revenue. According to data from OnlyGuider shared with Cointelegraph, the top 0.1% of creators earned $2,035,331 in April 2025, when Bitcoin’s average price was $94,207. As Bitcoin prices continued to rise in May and June, earnings for the top 0.1% also increased, reaching $2,038,972 in May and $2,052,502 in June. Most OnlyFans subscribers spend their money on top models. Source: OnlyGuider Bitcoin’s relationship with OnlyFans and adult entertainment Crypto was once seen as an alternative tool for facilitating payments to adult content creators. Pornhub, one of the industry’s largest platforms, began accepting cryptocurrency as early as 2018. OnlyFans, however, has taken a different path and does not offer crypto as a payment method. “Crypto payments are not very popular in our brothel. Most clients prefer cash because it leaves no trace. Only a very small number of the women working with us accept crypto payments, and even then, the total number of transactions per year is extremely low,” De Noire said. “We haven’t noticed any significant change in spending behavior that corresponds with crypto fluctuations. Whether Bitcoin or Ethereum is performing well or not doesn’t seem to have a direct effect on how much our clients are willing to spend,” she added. Erotic film star Allie Eve Knox has stronger ties to the crypto community as an advocate for integrating cryptocurrency into the adult industry and through her involvement with SpankChain, which launched initiatives like SpankPay, a crypto payment option for adult creators that has since been discontinued. Knox, who offers her content on several platforms, including OnlyFans, agreed that the price of Bitcoin doesn’t appear to have a meaningful impact on her earnings. “Anytime crypto hits an all-time high, our traffic actually slows,” Knox told Cointelegraph. “People want to see the biggest number in their account and screenshot it. It’s not typical for them to go passing out money to get their wanks.” Knox has been in the adult entertainment industry for 11 years and says she’s experienced 36 account closures over her career — from bank accounts to Cash App and PayPal. Crypto offered an alternative way to accept payments, but ironically, she claims she was de-banked even by crypto platforms. “I showed a Showtime documentary crew how I could display my Coinbase QR code on camera, and viewers could pay me in Bitcoin or Ether. The day after it aired, Coinbase shut my account down.” Modern payment options — whether crypto or digital banking — make transactions easier for both consumers and businesses. However, electronic methods still draw scrutiny from banks when used by sex workers. In brothels, clients often prefer cash, sometimes even leaving mid-session to withdraw money from an ATM, De Noire said. “As an OnlyFans creator, however, I notice something a little bit similar. My subscribers generally have no issue using credit cards and trust the platform. Yet many of them still ask if they can pay via Bitcoin or other alternative methods,” she said. “Since OF doesn’t allow payments outside the platform, I haven’t pursued this further, but it’s clear that even online clients are looking for more privacy and control over the data they share with financial institutions.” Bitcoin’s honeymoon with OnlyFans models has passed Web3 and adult content had their “good old days,” according to Knox, who says the non-fungible token (NFT) boom of 2021 opened up new income streams and gave creators more options to reach fans and spend their crypto earnings. “Now, if a customer doesn’t already hold crypto, they have to move money from their bank, wait for it to clear into a wallet, maybe convert it, send it to a model, wait for confirmation and only then do they get the content,” she said. Creators are also facing increasing barriers worldwide. Recently, China launched a nationwide crackdown on OnlyFans, while Sweden, a nation that’s politically and culturally very different from China, has imposed restrictions on purchasing adult content. SpankPay cited a hostile regulatory climate as the reason for winding down its payment service. Source: SpankPay De Noire cited sociologist Zygmunt Bauman to point out that in today’s society, consumers aren’t just trying to survive, but they prioritize enjoyment. “When you see a lot of non-essential services like massages, fancy coffee, wellness retreats or even sex work being used regularly, it’s a sign that the society has enough money going around,” De Noire said. While cryptocurrency was once hailed as a promising payment solution for adult content creators facing financial censorship, the reality is more complex. Despite pockets of overlap, such as simultaneous rises in Bitcoin prices and earnings among top OnlyFans creators, adult entertainers and their earnings have shown little correlation with Bitcoin’s price trends.

    "fullContent": "After Years Of Refusing Reforms, The CPB Accepts Institutional Death Over Political Dishonor Authored by Jonathan Turley, It is official. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting finally accepted death over balance. This week, the CPB announced that, with the withdrawal of federal funding, it would cease operations by September 30, 2025: “Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations.” The autopsy for the CPB, however, will put this cause of death as a self-inflicted blow. For almost 60 years, Republican Presidents and conservative politicians have complained about the overwhelming liberal bias at the CPB and its supported programs, particularly National Public Radio (NPR). For most of those years, the CPB could shrug off the complaints. The Democrats controlled one or both houses (or at least the White House). With the political left solidly behind the CPB, the corporation refused to carry out even modest reforms. It simply gave the stiff arm to every conservative effort to bring its programming back to the middle of the political spectrum. Even in the face of a GOP-controlled Congress and a Republican president, the CPB was defiant in denying any bias. It suggested that decades of complaints from the right were nothing more than the fevered imagination of far-right activists. For the record, I was not calling for the termination of funding of the CPB, which I thought could still be forced to reform itself. What I opposed was the continuation of funding for NPR as a state-subsidized media outlet. It was not the pronounced bias of NPR that I felt justified termination. This country should preserve a wall of separation between the government and the media, a view that even a former NPR CEO acknowledged recently as legitimate. CPB is different. It funded a broader array of programming and could easily correct its course. For decades, all the CPB had to do is refocus on programming to appeal to the greatest cross section of the population and to decline to fund media programs like NPR that became more strident and partisan by the year. It seemed that the CPB was trapped within its own echo chambered existence. On the left, the CPB was the hero institution standing up to social and political reactionaries. That is what CPB officials heard at cocktail parties and conferences. They heard little from the public outside of their core, narrow constituency. For individual administrators and board members, their status and success were tied to the very bias that was alienating most of America. For them, the choice was clear between neutrality and nonexistence: they grabbed a hemlock-filled, NPR pledge mug and drank deeply. They are not the only figures choosing death over social dishonor. Efforts to restore balance and neutrality at the Washington Post has led to a virtual revolt. Even after CEO William Lewis told staff that the newspaper was gushing readers and revenue, the staff refused to yield. He could not have put it more bluntly, telling them, “People are not reading your stuff.” In other words, they were writing for each other as readers were fleeing to other sources of news. You would think that Washington Post writers would recognize that, if they wanted to be journalists, they would have to return to more neutral and objective reporting. It does not work that way. Many of these editors and writers had secured their very positions in rejecting neutrality and embracing advocacy journalism. By their own previously stated standards, a return to traditional journalism would be capitulation and cowardice. Thus, they would rather see the Post go insolvent than independent. That takes us back to the CPB. The announcement of cessation was met with a chorus of wails and laments on the left. Yet, these are the same people who preferred this option to reforming the CPB to serve the greatest number of Americans. NPR made the same choice. A few years ago, it was given the opportunity to select a new CEO who would represent a serious, centrist leadership for the failing news organization. Instead, the board doubled down on that very bias and selected Katherine Maher, who had a long history of inflammatory political attacks on conservatives and was the very embodiment of activism. As late as a few months ago, CPB could have come forward with real reforms. Instead, PBS President Paula Kerger threatened legal action if Congress had the temerity to refuse to fund her organization. At the same time, she did nothing to distance herself from NPR, which was dragging down CPB like an anchor. Even as NPR’s Katherine Maher imploded before Congress, Kerger refused to budge. The irony is that NPR is likely to survive in reduced form, appealing to a shrinking audience of predominantly white, affluent, liberal listeners in major cities. Conversely, CPB is laying off its entire staff in a righteous, indignant huff. None of these people needed to lose their jobs if their leadership served their organization by listening to views beyond their own insular circle of enablers. The demise of the CPB now stands as the most impressive and unnecessary act of self-termination since the appearance of Judean People’s Front Crack Suicide Squad: Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 12:40",
