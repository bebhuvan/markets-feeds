We show, through simulations and analytically, that the result depends on the way the algorithm is set up. A basic Q-learning algorithm leads to loss-free prices and is, therefore, not fit for trade. Carefully choosing the exploration and learning parameters leads to less extreme prices, but still far away from the competitive ones. When we endow the algorithm with a basic understanding of the market and basic information about outstanding quotes, the Q-learning algorithms produce competitive prices.",

    "summary": "How does the expansion of commodity export production impact the skill premium in a developing colonial economy? In this paper, we examine this question by relating sugar and coffee production – two key exports – to the relative wage of skilled to unskilled workers in early twentieth-century Java, Indonesia. Drawing on a newly-constructed dataset of regionally-disaggregated production figures and wages, we find a positive relationship between sugar production and the skill premium, but no relationship between coffee production and the skill premium. Using several instruments exploiting exogenous variation in global market prices and local production suitability, we find evidence for a causal effect of sugar production on the skill premium. Specifically, we estimate that a 10% increase in sugar production boosted the skill premium by about 10-11%. A substantial amount of skilled labour was involved in commodity production processes, in particular that of sugar, but there was a general s",

    "summary": "Rational individuals who obtain a premium by passing an imprecise test change their choice of costly competence when the pass threshold varies. At given premium that reaction prevents variation of the failure rate completely if the marginal cost of competence is constant, only partially if it is increasing. The offsetting effect of endogenous competence is stronger when the pass premium varies in the same direction as the threshold, as it plausibly does when in equilibrium it depends on the expected competence differential between otherwise unobservably heterogeneous individuals who pass and fail. Failure rates remain very similar as different thresholds elicit different endogenous competence, and depend much more strongly on the test's precision: the outcome of a frequently failed test must be very random from the point of view of those who take it.",

We identify two key effects of AI improvement: A freeriding effect raises worker rents by increasing the probability of successful investment when the worker shirks; A capital reallocation effect shifts investment toward workers with higher or lower rents, depending on which tasks AI improves. Contrary to standard predictions, AI can raise both worker rents and labor demand. We derive implications for capital allocation, labor demand, compensation, and welfare.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20457",
    "summary": "Do trade dependencies leave countries vulnerable to geopolitical coercion? We study the economic costs of trade and financial sanctions, from 1920 to the present. We first develop a continuous measure of sanction intensity, using bilateral commodity-level data to calculate the importance of specific flows that fall under sanctions. We find that sanctions inflict relatively small costs on average: sanctioning 1% of GDP worth of imports or exports leads to approximately 0.3 percentage points of lost GDP over a 5-year period and a 0.1 percentage point increase in unemployment. However, we show that sanctions are far more costly for countries whose trade is highly concentrated, and for countries that rely heavily on exporting primary commodities. Low income and developing countries appear most vulnerable to trade sanctions, while high income financial centers and some EU countries are among the most exposed to financial sanctions.",

Below I show the absolute value of the nominal US$ index (blue, right scale) together with the YoY% changes, going back 60 years (red, left scale):Here is a graph of the H1 decline in the US$ over that same period:The decline in the absolute value US$ does not look particularly bad vs. several post-recession declines in the past, and on a YoY% basis it is only down 5%. But as the immediately above graph shows, the 10% H1 decline is among the sharpest in the past 60 years.

    "summary": "Mark Carlson, Zack Saravay, and Mary TianWe examine how primary dealers utilized repo operations conducted by the Federal Reserve from September 2019 until May 2020 and how usage affected dealer borrowing and lending. Using daily dealer-level supervisory data, we find that during normal market conditions, dealers primarily used Fed repo to expand their total repo borrowing and on-lent much of this funding to a broad variety of counterparties. However, during market stress in March 2020, dealers used Fed repo as a substitute for funding from other counterparties and focused their on-lending to affiliated counterparties. Moreover, dealers with more headroom under the Supplementary Leverage Ratio requirement used more of their Fed repo borrowing to provide intermediation in funding markets. Our results underscore the critical role that the Fed's repo operations played, especially in March 2020, by reducing dealer funding stress and enabling dealers to pass on liquidity.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20455",
    "summary": "We consider a privately informed sender selecting a mediated communication device to influence players’ actions. In contrast to standard information design, there is no ex-ante commitment, and the communication device relies on information elicited from the informed parties. We define an informed communication equilibrium (ICE) as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium outcome of the informed mediated communication game. We show that the set of ICE is the subset of communication equilibria (CE) that yield sender payoff vectors bounded below by an equilibrium payoff vector of the silent game, under some consistent interim beliefs. The principal’s ex-ante optimal CE may not be an ICE. In sender-receiver games, the set of CE payoff vectors lies in the convex hull of the set of payoff vectors above silence. Hence, if the latter set is convex, as is the case when the sender has transparent motives, the sets of CE and ICE coincide.",

    "title": "DP20456 Trading by Professional Traders: An Experiment",
    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20456",
    "summary": "We study the behavior of professional traders in an experiment in which, endowed with private information, they trade an asset over multiple periods. Professional traders do not produce the price bubbles observed with student subjects and aggregate private information better; bubbles also do not arise in mixed markets with traders and students trading together. Professional traders exhibit higher strategic sophistication than students as measured by their Guessing Game choices. We link strategic sophistication to trading in the financial market, and show that traders with higher levels of strategic sophistication earn higher capital gains and trading profits.",

    "title": "DP20452 Trading Blows: The Exchange-Rate Response to  Tariffs and Retaliations",
    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20452",
    "summary": "This paper provides econometric evidence on how exchange rates respond to tariffs. We construct a new tariff-shock database, which captures tariff-related announcements, threats and implementations by the U.S., China, the Euro Area and Canada between 2018 and 2020, and in 2025. Our shock measure accounts for both the size of tariff rates and their economic relevance. We show that exchange rates react to U.S. tariff shocks in systematically different ways depending on retaliation: the U.S. dollar (USD) appreciates if the tariff is imposed unilaterally, but depreciates if other countries retaliate. This empirical pattern resonates with the predictions of recent open-macro models with dominant currency pricing. In light of our evidence and drawing on theory, we conclude that the USD depreciation following the U.S. tariff announcement on April 2nd 2025 was not surprising. The spike in long-maturity U.S. Treasury yields was, however, more unprecedented.",
