We challenge the view that such attitudes reflect national preferences. Instead, we offer an economic explanation based on a two-country Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian model, bringing its implicit political economy dimension to the forefront. We compute the welfare implications of alternative fiscal policies at the household level to assess the conditions under which a policy commands majority support. Whether the majority supports fiscal conservatism or liberalism depends on a country’s debt level, its wealth distribution, and the nature of the economic shock.",

    "summary": "Seven decades ago, Simon Kuznets put forward the hypothesis that as economies developed, national inequality would first increase and then decrease—an inverted U-shape. He provided preliminary evidence for the hypothesis on the basis of the limited data available at the time, and theorized the genesis of the curve as arising from the twin forces of structural transformation of the economy and political economy pressures. Seven decades on, the Kuznets curve still has a hold on the development discourse as new data is used to test the hypothesis, new theories are elaborated to explain the evolution of inequality, and the metaphor of an inverse U-shape is extended beyond its original realm of national inequality. With this rich history and background, the time is right to examine the Kuznets curve literature broadly construed. This overview takes stock of what has been learned and highlights emerging research and policy questions.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20472",
    "summary": "Despite the formal end of Apartheid in 1994, South Africa remains one of the most unequal countries in the world. This paper investigates the mechanisms behind this persistence of inequality by developing a spatial dynastic model with heterogeneous agents, incomplete markets, and endogenous choices over education, occupation, savings, and location. Drawing on newly assembled micro-geographic data, we document a shift in inequality from being primarily across races to increasingly within the Black population, with spatial segregation — especially the legacy of Townships — playing a key role. Our model, disciplined by detailed spatial and socioeconomic data, captures the slow intergenerational convergence in education and occupational outcomes observed in post-Apartheid South Africa. It shows how inherited spatial disadvantages — through high commuting costs, disparities in school quality, and limited access to credit — continue to shape households’ educational, occupational, and locatio",

The first is the role that cash holdings play in a business, an extension of the dividend policy question, with an examination of why businesses often should not pay out what they have available to shareholders. In my classes and writing on corporate finance, I look at the motives for businesses retaining cash, as well as how much cash is too much cash. The second is bitcoin, which can be viewed as either a currency or a collectible, and in a series of posts, I argued that bitcoin can only be priced, not valued, making debates about whether to buy or not to buy entirely a function of perception. In fact, I have steered away from saying much about bitcoin in recent years, though I did mention it in my post on alternative investments as a collectible (like gold) that can be added to the choice mix.

This morning’s report on housing permits, starts, and construction continues the trend that has been in place for several years.For the month, permits (gold in the graph below) increased 3,000 to 1.397 annualized, while the more noisy starts (blue) increased 58,000 to 1.321 annualized. But both of these are still very close to their post-pandemic lows. But the metric that is the least noisy of all and conveys the most signal, single family starts (red), decreased 33,000 to 866,000 annualized:In the above graph, I normalized permits and single family permits to 100 as of their post-pandemic peaks. I did the same for starts, but used their peak three month average. Starts are down 23.9% from their peak, permits 27.2%, and single family permits 30.3%. Is this sufficient to be recessionary?
