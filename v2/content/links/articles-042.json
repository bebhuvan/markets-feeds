    "fullContent": "Xi Tells Putin China Ready To Back Peace & Negotiations With US On Ukraine Yesterday it was confirmed by both sides that Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Puitin would have their first face-to-face bilatal summit, just 'days' away - prompting a Friday phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russia's Putin. Chinese state media specifically indicated the Xi call is in anticipation of the historic Trump-Putin meeting, which will be the first of the over three-year long Ukriane war. Illustrative: AFP/Getty Images During the call, Putin updated Xi on recent US-Russia communications and expressed Russia’s willingness to maintain close coordination with China, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV indicated - also as echoed in Russian media. Xi expressed support for ongoing dialogue between Russia and the U.S., welcomed improved relations between the two countries, and made clear that China backs efforts toward a political resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. \"China welcomes Russia-US contacts, improving relations and advancing political settlement of Ukrainian crisis,\" Xi Jinping was quoted as saying. \"China would like to see Russia and the United States maintain contact, improve their relations, and promote a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.\" —state broadcaster CCTV He further noted that complex problems require nuanced solutions and reaffirmed China’s commitment to promoting dialogue to help resolve regional disputes, per the readout. This just after Kremlin announced Thursday that Putin and Trump had agreed to meet in the coming days to seek a potential end to the war in Ukraine. Trump had previously set a Friday deadline for Russia to accept a ceasefire, warning of expanded sanctions if no agreement is reached - and so it will be interesting if confirmation of the upcoming meeting changes this in any way, or possibly softens the rollout. When it comes to the war in Ukraine, Washington is now not only looking to squeeze Moscow economically, but there are new targets in its crosshairs, related to Russian oil sales to China and India. Trump is even looking a new expanded sanctions on Russia's so-called Shadow Fleet. 🇨🇳🇷🇺 XI TO PUTIN: CHINA BACKS U.S.–RUSSIA CONTACTS, DEFENDS TRADE TIES In a phone call with Putin, Xi said China welcomes continued communication between Russia and the United States, while defending Beijing’s trade and energy deals with Moscow as “lawful” despite U.S. sanction… https://t.co/EphzxkZXzn pic.twitter.com/bY1kCS4BXz — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) August 8, 2025 This has remained an unexpected sticking point in ongoing US-China trade talks in Stockholm. Both sides are seeking to avert punishing tariffs and reach a broader trade deal, so President Xi definitely has a huge interest in stake in what happens between Trump and Putin.

    "fullContent": "Insiders Sold The July Rally Via RealInvestmentAdvice.com, While the market steadily rose throughout June and July, corporate insiders were growing less enthusiastic about their stocks. Less than a third of S&P 500 companies saw insiders purchase stock in their own company in July. That is the lowest figure since 2018. Moreover, the ratio of buys to sells for insiders fell to almost half of its longer-term average and now sits at its second-lowest reading in four years. Source: Bloomberg Per Bloomberg’s article “Corporate Insiders Were Dumping Stocks Into July’s Record Rally“: “Corporate executives are behaving a lot like institutional investors right now: cautious, conservative, and valuation-sensitive,” said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Investments. “The people that know the most about companies are telling you that much of the good news is discounted,” The logic in following the actions of corporate insiders is that they have more knowledge about their companies than other investors. Thus, their cumulative actions indicate their valuation view is different from that of the optimistic market. While the recent bout of insider selling and lack of buying is a warning, it’s not a good timing tool. Bottom line: This data, along with high valuations, a weakening economy, and overbought technicals, provides a good reason for caution. However, we should not overreact. Insiders do have more knowledge, but their collective actions have proven at times to be poor indicators of the future. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 08:05",
