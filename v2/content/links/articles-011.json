    "fullContent": "Fleeing High-Cost Blue States? Here's Where Bills Are Lowest The U.S. consumer landscape remains mixed. Recent datapoints have painted a softer macroeconomic backdrop, with subpar jobs reports with downward revisions, a pullback in personal spending, two consecutive monthly declines in credit card balances, a record jump in student loan delinquencies, and downward pressure in consumer discretionary stocks. However, July’s consumer report showed an unexpected surge in spending, suggesting resilience so far this summer despite economic headwinds. Against this complicated macroeconomic backdrop for consumers, new data from DoxoINSIGHTS’ 2025 State-by-State Bill Pay Market Report provides a granular view of household bill costs nationwide. The report ranks states by monthly expenses, highlighting the most and least expensive places to live. Doxo's unique aggregate bill pay dataset shows that consumers spend an average of $2,058 per month on bills, or about 31% of the $84,583 median household income. The analysis, covering 97% of ZIP codes and 45 bill categories, shows California, Hawaii, New Jersey, and Massachusetts as the priciest states, while West Virginia, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma are the cheapest. Californians face a median monthly bill of $2,854, 39% above the national level, compared with $1,149 in West Virginia, 44% below. The report, based on median payments for 13 major household expenses including mortgages, rent, utilities, auto loans, insurance and telecoms, ranks all 50 states by bill cost. 10 Most Expensive States for Household Bills 10 Least Expensive States for Household Bills This state-level cost profile can help individuals and employers make more informed decisions when considering job relocations or moves to escape expensive blue states to affordable red states. * * * View the full report here: . . .

    "fullContent": "Trump Says Xi Assured Him China Will Not Invade Taiwan During His Presidency Authored by Travis Gillmore via The Epoch Times, President Donald Trump said Chinese leader Xi Jinping promised him that China will refrain from invading Taiwan for the next four years. Trump made the remarks during a nearly 30-minute-long interview with Fox News’ Brett Baier which was filmed on Air Force One and aired while the president was in Alaska meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I will never do it as long as you’re president; President Xi told me that, and I said, well, I appreciate that,” Trump said. The guarantee does not extend to future administrations, the president noted. “But he also said, but I am very patient, and China is very patient,” Trump said. “Say, well, that’s up to you, but it better not happen now.” It remains unclear when Xi made the remarks. The White House did not respond to requests for comment before publication. Taiwan, a self-governing democratic island territory, is viewed by Beijing as a breakaway province. Its freedom remains a volatile point of contention in U.S.-China relations. The United States guarantees defensive arms to Taipei under the Taiwan Relations Act. Xi has vowed to achieve “reunification” with the island by any means necessary, and he’s ramped up military exercises in the waters around the island. Optimism that the president’s foreign policy agenda will deter China’s aggression is a recurring theme in the administration’s first 200 days. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin in March that China will stay out of Taiwan. “I follow President Trump’s lead, and he is confident that President Xi will not make that move during his presidency,” Bessent said. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth publicly declared at the Shangri-La Dialogue—an annual summit held in Singapore by the International Institute for Strategic Studies—in May that China is signaling a desire to be capable of attacking the island nation by 2027, with a buildup in nuclear weapons and military readiness. “Every day you see it. China’s military harasses Taiwan,” Hegseth said. “It has to be clear to all that Beijing is credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.” He expressed confidence that the communist regime will wait until the current administration leaves office, but warned of the threat the Chinese Communist Party poses to world peace. “Again, to be clear: any attempt by communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world,” Hegseth said. “There’s no reason to sugarcoat it. The threat China poses is real.” Tyler Durden Sat, 08/16/2025 - 15:10",

    "fullContent": "Here's Where ChatGPT Is Currently Banned Governments around the world are taking different stances on artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT. While some embrace the technology, others have restricted or outright banned access due to political, cultural, or security concerns. In 2025, ChatGPT remains unavailable in 20 countries. In this visualization, Visual Capitalist's Marcus Lu highlights where ChatGPT is banned, as well as places where OpenAI does not offer service. Data & Discussion The data for this visualization comes from a list compiled by Cybernews, which we referenced with an official OpenAI list of supported countries. Government-Imposed Bans Many of the bans are found in countries with strict internet control, such as China, North Korea, and Iran. These governments limit access to foreign digital platforms, often citing information control and political stability as reasons. In China, for example, users have access to several LLMs that were developed by domestic companies, including Alibaba’s Qwen, DeepSeek, Baichuan, and Tencent-backed Hunyuan. Meanwhile, in conflict zones like Syria, Afghanistan, and Yemen, bans are linked to both security concerns and limited infrastructure. Unsupported Regions Not all countries on the list have active bans. In places like Hong Kong and Belarus, the service is unavailable because OpenAI does not support accounts there. These exclusions are often due to business, regulatory, or legal complexities rather than explicit censorship.

Yes you read that right, she said something nice about him. What’s she up to? Hillary declared on the ‘Raging Moderates’ podcast that she is pleased with the way Trump has dealt with NATO in recent months. Hillary Clinton praises Trump: “I actually was encouraged by the events of the last several months. The NATO commitment by individual member states to increase defense spending is very welcome and the willingness of European countries to support Ukraine.” pic.twitter.com/mYCbAHPuE2 — TheBlaze (@theblaze) August 15, 2025 “I actually was encouraged by the events of the last several months. First of all, the NATO commitment by individual member states to increase their defense spending is very welcome. It’s something that prior administrations have certainly sought,” Clinton said. Trump has pressured the other member states to boost spending from just 2 percent of their GDP to 5 percent, and made a deal for NATO to foot the bill for US weapons going to Ukraine. “I think it’s great that we are seeing these commitments that now have to be followed through on,” Hillary stated. ‘Great’ is an interesting choice of word. She added that “The willingness of European countries to support Ukraine, and by doing so by American weapons in order to provide them to the Ukrainians,” Of course, she wants more weapons for Ukraine, and Trump had to do that deal. Under the agreement, European NATO members—Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the UK, and Canada—commit to purchasing billions of dollars worth of American military equipment, including Patriot air defense systems, missiles, artillery, and ammunition. These allies then either send the newly acquired U.S. weapons directly to Ukraine or donate their existing stockpiles to Kyiv while replenishing their own inventories with U.S. replacements. This setup marks a shift from direct U.S. aid packages, which Trump has heavily criticized as overly burdensome on American taxpayers. “I think all of that is a very good signal that there is beginning to be a better understanding, both by the president and the people around him, as well as by the leaders of our European allies, that there can be common ground amongst us,” Clinton further suggested. “And the kind of dismissiveness that we saw in the first Trump administration has been replaced by a much more obvious working relationship to the good of European security, transatlantic security, and hopefully Ukrainian security. So I’m actually encouraged,” she added. Elsewhere during the podcast, Hillary commented on Trump’s meeting with Vladimir Putin scheduled for today, noting “Honestly, if he could bring about the end to this terrible war, if he could end it without putting Ukraine in a position where it had to concede its territory to the aggressor, could really stand up to Putin — something we haven’t seen, but maybe this is the opportunity — if President Trump were the architect of that, I’d nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.” “Because my goal here is to not allow capitulation to Putin,” Clinton added. Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin meet today in Alaska and even Hillary Clinton sees a path toward a Nobel Peace Prize for Trump (but it’s going to take a lot). Here’s how: https://t.co/SPuj87qz48 pic.twitter.com/4GJPBmSnhs — Jessica Tarlov (@JessicaTarlov) August 15, 2025 Trump responded to Clinton’s comments in his inimitable style. 🔥Bige news: Hillary Clinton said \"i will nominate you for the Nobel Peace Prize if you get a deal with Russia without capitulating to Putin… 🎙️President Trump: PRESIDENT TRUMP: \"Well, that was very nice – I may have to start liking her again.\"😁 pic.twitter.com/oMvXXe34HR — Wall Street Mav (@WallStreetMav) August 15, 2025 As we highlighted earlier, Trump has announced that his meeting with Vladmir Putin on Friday was “very successful” and that a full peace deal, not merely a ceasefire, is in the works. Trump cautioned that this is highly dependent on Ukrainian President Zelensky playing ball, but that he is ready to act as mediator between Zelensky and Putin.

    "fullContent": "China's \"Assassin's Mace\" Irregular Warfare Campaign May Render Trump's Golden Dome Useless There has been extensive media coverage of President Trump's new Golden Dome hemispheric defense push, a key element of the administration's revised force posture in the Western Hemisphere. CNN reported Friday that the Pentagon is preparing to deploy thousands of troops across Latin American waters to disrupt narco-terrorist command-and-control networks. Here is the critical blind spot most are overlooking: All of this hemispheric defense posturing, and the eventual missile defense shield, basically an Iron Dome on steroids, risks being completely undermined by Beijing's asymmetric warfare playbook. Aware of its conventional military disadvantages relative to the U.S., the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its armed wing, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), have invested heavily in unconventional weapons systems and covert action programs that are already well underway. Several of the PLA's irregular warfare tools and covert action programs can be classified as Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). These include bioweapons, biochemical weapons, nanoweapons, brain-computer interface weapons, directed-energy weapons, and miniaturized EMPs. With American deaths caused by Covid-19 now well exceeding Vietnam War casualty figures, a strong case can be made that the CCP's covert program to develop, test, and deploy the next generation of more lethal, genetically stable, and stealthy engineered pathogens qualifies as a WMD program. It's become entirely clear that the CCP shows limited to no signs of modifying or reversing its intent to target, degrade, and eventually dissolve the U.S. from within, conquer Taiwan, dominate the Indo-Pacific, and implode the dollar system for a new \"international system\" for all things China. President Trump knows this, which is why he recently said any BRICS member will be slapped with tariffs over de-dollarization attempts. What the CCP clearly understands is that the U.S. remains the single greatest obstacle to its global domination plan. By contrast, Europe has effectively neutralized itself through the consequences of mass migration and the self-sabotaging policies of woke liberal elites in Brussels. This is why the CCP has developed a dark new unconventional weapons platform system that is designed to achieve kinetic effects inside the U.S. that are traditionally associated with conventional warfare. Typical democrat run city, how can people vote for this, democrats do you really think this is helping these addicts? Look at all that democrat progress. These people need help, not free drugs and a place to be high until they die. pic.twitter.com/bNoh5QNLdp — Greg Dayoob 🇺🇲 (@CoachDayoob) August 10, 2025 The book China's Total War Strategy: Next-Generation Weapons of Mass Destruction - published by the CCP BioThreats Initiative and authored by Dr. Ryan Clarke, LJ Eads, Dr. Robert McCreight, and Dr. Xiaoxu Sean Lin - outlines how the CCP has been pursuing an aggressive, multifaceted \"total war\" against the U.S. that leverages next-generation weapons, including synthetic narcotics (e.g., fentanyl and cannabinoids), bioweapons (e.g., Covid-19), psychological manipulation and influence (e.g., TikTok), and a broad arsenal of irregular warfare tools. The authors describe this strategy as the CCP's \"assassin's mace\", an indirect, hybrid warfare doctrine designed to exploit U.S. vulnerabilities and collapse the nation from within. The results are already visible in the fentanyl epidemic and the broader drug crisis. Compounding the threat, as we must add, Democratic leadership in major U.S. cities has spent years refusing to enforce certain laws, defunding police, and allowing open-air drug markets. This has fueled a decade of decline, accelerating the spiral of America's urban centers into death and destruction from within, something President Trump and his 'America First' leadership in the White House no longer tolerate and called in federal troops to stop the death and destruction. The book is structured around several pillars of the CCP's irregular warfare techniques. It emphasizes asymmetric technologies (e.g., bioweapons, nanoweapons, electromagnetic systems), as well as the CCP's strategy that will undermine the U.S. from within. Here are those three pillars, plus the fourth pillar, which describes U.S. response options: Pillar One: The (Previously) Unsurfaced Revolution in Military Affairs – The Weaponization of Nature (Bioweapons, Nanoweapons, and (Bio) Chemical Weapons) This pillar details the CCP/PLA's acceleration of offensive biological, nano-, and chemical programs, often hidden in civilian research. Key points include: Post-COVID Bioweapons Expansion: Acceleration of programs at institutions like the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (HVRI), and Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS). Involves gain-of-function (GoF) research, synthetic virus creation, and pathogen engineering, with networks linking civilian and military labs. The CCP has absorbed Western expertise, demonstrating willingness to sacrifice millions (e.g., during COVID-19) to protect regime interests. International Frontiers: Expansion into Pakistan via joint labs for high-risk pathogens, enhancing stealth and deniability. Synthetic Narcotics as Weapons: CCP-backed syndicates traffic fentanyl-like substances, targeting the Five Eyes Alliance (U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) with unique distribution patterns as a vectored threat. Nanoweapons Development: Invisible arsenals blending nanotechnology with biology/chemistry for targeted delivery, increasing stealth and origin obfuscation. Risks require multifaceted non-proliferation efforts. Dual-Use Virology and Nanotechnology: Advances in stealthy, point-of-origin-obscuring tech, including exponential increases in capabilities post-COVID. BGI Genomics Entanglements: Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) linked to PLA for biosecurity, military applications, and ethical dilemmas. Research thrusts include genetic modification, therapies, pathogen identification, and data analytics—promising advancements but raising security concerns (e.g., military associations, data privacy). Chemical Defense Research: PLA's Research Institute of Chemical Defense focuses on guardians of \"invisible arsenals,\" advancing dual-use chemical weapons. The pillar warns of unreformable institutions (e.g., WIV, AMMS) due to decades of CCP control, PLA integration, and bioweapons focus. Pillar Two: Weaponizing New Energy and the Electromagnetic Spectrum (NeuroStrike, Scalar Waves, and EMP) Focuses on non-kinetic, cognitive-domain warfare using energy and electromagnetic tools. Key points: TikTok as Subversion Tool: U.S. operations involve psychological manipulation, shaping perceptions, and cognitive warfare to undermine unity. NeuroStrike Program: PLA's advanced psychological weapons target cognitive spaces, collapsing enemy resolve. Involves AI, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), biological weapons, and tactics for precision targeting non-CCP intellectuals via social media. Cognitive Warfare Evolution: PLA emphasizes psychological resilience, embedding operations in modern conflict. Categories include military intimidation, bilateral influence, religious interference, and disinformation. Mirrors broader shifts to uncertainty/invisibility as threats. EMP Weapons: Rising threat of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) systems for grid disruption and global destabilization. Scalar Waves: Potentially globally destabilizing force, exploiting new energy domains for asymmetric advantage. This pillar highlights the PLA's integration of tech for \"next-generation warfare in the cognitive age,\" expanding combat into psychological dimensions. Pillar Three: Stealing for the Future – Western Subversion, Strategic IP Exfiltration, and (Dual-Use) Research for Next-Generation WMD Development Examines CCP's exploitation of Western institutions for technology transfer. Key points: Hypersonic Collaborations: Sino-American ties in aerodynamic frontiers, encompassing design to propulsion (e.g., scramjet tech). Talent Acquisition: Eastern Institute of Technology (Ningbo) recruits U.S. experts for dual-use advancements; generous policies (e.g., relocation subsidies up to 8 million RMB for top talents). 6G Ambitions: Purple Mountain Laboratories (Nanjing) leverages U.S. experts for global tech supremacy. Brain-Inspired AI: McGovern Institute's PLA engagements in neuroscience research. International Academic Ties: Collaborations between ETH Zurich/University of Toronto and PLA/Chinese defense academia, facilitating IP exfiltration. Chip Alliance Circumvention: Maneuvers by China (and Russia) to bypass the Chip Four Alliance (U.S., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) plus the Netherlands, targeting semiconductors. The pillar stresses challenges in navigating global tech supremacy, intellectual property theft, and infiltration of U.S./Allied institutions. Pillar Four: Strategic Offense and Collapsing Threat Networks – Response Options for Rapidly Accelerating CCP WMD Programs Outlines countermeasures amid CCP regime collapse scenarios. Key points: National Biodefense Strategy: Forging a coherent \"malevolent matrix\" to address biothreats, emphasizing precision targeting. Targeting Bioweapons Facilities: Post-CCP collapse options include ground entry/occupation (U.S. Army-led), air/missile strikes (U.S. Air Force/Navy), or unconventional operations (CIA-led with State/Treasury/Commerce support). Destruction is deemed the only viable path, with surveillance to prevent reconstitution. Global Threat Assessment: CCP's total war strategy post-2025 involves convergent WMD (nano-, bio-, chemical, directed energy), academic subversion, and non-kinetic shifts (neuroscience, scalar). Echoes classical strategies for indirect dominance, undermining Western infrastructure, morale, and cohesion. Focusing on the pillars above and the dilemmas and threats post-2025 - especially in the 2030s as the world fractures deeper into a bi-polar state, it describes ongoing infiltration, subversion, espionage, and exploitation through irregular warfare techinques, mainly though the exploitation of Western openness, particularly in academia, technology, and media, to erode U.S. advantages without direct kinetic conflict. This means CCP is already degrading America from within - and not through a fight in the Pacific or launching hypersonic gliders at the U.S. West Coast. This begs the question about Trump's $175 billion Golden Dome, how will missile interceptors stop the drug death crisis, TikTok brain rot, color revolutions in city streets (think billionaire Neville Roy Singham's far-left Marxist NGO network), and other irregular warfare techniques? We must come to terms with the fight that is already here. Tyler Durden Sat, 08/16/2025 - 13:25",

    "fullContent": "Florida Highway Horror: Migrant Truck Driver Leaves 3 Americans Dead Amid CDL Crisis Submitted by American Truckers United, In yet another tragic incident underscoring the dangers on America's highways, a Punjabi migrant truck driver allegedly executed an illegal U-turn on Florida's Turnpike near Fort Pierce on August 12, resulting in a catastrophic collision that killed three innocent Americans. The semi-truck, attempting the prohibited maneuver in an \"official use only\" area, was struck by a minivan carrying a 30-year-old driver from Pompano Beach and his passengers—a 37-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man from Miami. All three perished, with two dying at the scene and the driver succumbing later in the hospital. Video footage captured the horrifying moment, showing the 18-wheeler blocking lanes and causing the fatal impact. The driver, reportedly an Indian migrant suspected of being part of a California Eco-System that exploits cheap labor, walked away uninjured. This crash mirrors a disturbing trend we've repeatedly highlighted: untrained migrant drivers flooding U.S. highways, leading to preventable deaths. As American Truckers United has warned in previous reports, the Biden-era surge in foreign and non-domiciled CDLs has turned interstates into killing fields. From the deadly pileups in Austin, Terrell, Thomasville, and Chattanooga involving suspected non-citizen truckers, to cargo thefts by \"ghost carriers,\" these incidents are no coincidence. We've urged Transportation Secretary Duffy to ban CDLs issued to non-citizens and probe these threats, but inaction persists amid record migrant influxes into the industry. This Florida tragedy, involving a California-based trucking profile from this cheap labor ecosystem, fits the exact mold: reckless actions by undertrained foreigners endangering American lives. Multilingual signs at Walmart and Amazon depots signal the scale, yet mom-and-pop U.S. truckers face bankruptcy while migrants fuel fraud and fatalities.\" For the edification of the group, here are the most common last names of trucking companies started since 2018. pic.twitter.com/IPz80w3H30 — may be danielle 💻🚛🇺🇸 (@maybedanielleee) August 16, 2025 How many more Americans must die before we secure our highways? American Truckers United demands immediate federal intervention to halt this national security nightmare. The American Trucking Industry has been gutted by unregulated immigration over the past five years. These “California ” drivers are part of an eco system that puts profit over safety.

    "fullContent": "Watch: Hellfire Missile Launcher Hidden Inside Civilian Box Truck Concealing missile and rocket artillery launchers, or even swarms of kamikaze drones, inside civilian-style trucks and shipping containers fits directly into next-generation warfare, especially under the umbrella of deception and the ability to distribute lethality in plain sight. The latest setup to pique our interest is a truck-mounted launch system for AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, developed by the 209th Arsenal, a production facility within Taiwan's Armaments Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense. According to military blog The War Zone, the twin-rail Hellfire launcher inside the bed of a box truck has a roof-mounted sensor mast that carries a small radar and an electro-optical/infrared sensor turret. The system can fire laser-guided Hellfires and radar-guided AGM-114L Longbows. Video of the box truck with missiles in the rear first appeared on the Military News Agency's YouTube page on Thursday, in a short feature from Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense showcasing the latest military technology. TWZ noted, \"Missile and rocket artillery launchers hidden in plain sight inside civilian-style trucks, as well as unassuming shipping containers, have become something of a trend globally in recent years. China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and even the United States have all been developing and/or fielding systems that fall into these categories,\" adding, \"Terrorists and other non-state actors have also employed improvised concealed launch systems over the years.\" Which brings us to the other side of the world, where Ukraine recently launched a brazen drone swarm attack deep inside Russia using shipping containers packed with armed drones. These containers were hidden in plain sight, allowing the drones, armed with mini warheads, to penetrate far into Russian territory and strike Moscow's fleet of long-range bombers, damaging several. We found a warehouse where containers with drones were collected. Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk tract 28A. It was rented for 350,000 rubles. That's why the truck in the Amur region had Chelyabinsk license plates - they were leaving from there. pic.twitter.com/rf5DJy8RDa — Elizaveta Igorevna 🇷🇺 🇷🇺 (@ElisaIgorevna) June 1, 2025 Ukraine just mounted an attack that marks a turning point in the history of warfare Hundreds of drones were pre-deployed and then struck 40+ aircraft 1000+ km inside of Russia $1B in damage by Critical infra is no longer safepic.twitter.com/qaPS3oKD1Y — Shaun Maguire (@shaunmmaguire) June 1, 2025 The bigger picture here is that militaries are disguising weapon systems as ordinary vehicles, shipping containers, and likely other in-plain-sight platforms that can bypass traditional countermeasures. This points to a very dangerous world ahead of the 2030s, one we would characterize as a high-threat environment. Tyler Durden Sat, 08/16/2025 - 12:15",

    "fullContent": "Boiled Frogs: AI Slop, Phishing, Deep-Fakes, & Spam, Spam, Spam Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog, We're frogs in a pot that's being heated so gradually that we no longer notice the sewage is extinguishing the utility of the Web. Let's take \"Show me the incentives, and I'll show you the outcome\" and direct it on the Internet, the digital realm that is now central to modern life The incentives are making money from attention, i.e. clicks, engagement, etc. by any means available, and a burgeoning universe of cons, deception, extortion and fraud. And with those incentives, the outcome is an ever-expanding river of toxic sewage, a river of AI slop, deep-fakes, phishing, clickbait and spam, spam, spam on every device, every platform, every screen. This is not inconsequential. A physician-correspondent recently reported that he was researching a cardiovascular condition online and realized the article he was reviewing was AI slop, a conglomeration of inaccurate diagrams and plausible-sounding nonsense slapped together to get whatever meager income would be generated by a modest number of views. That's the incentive the Big Tech platforms set up: since it's a low-odds gamble that any post will go viral on a large enough scale to make serious income, the incentive is to post 1,000 AI slop posts which each collect 1,000 views. In other words, make it up on volume. Since the Internet is global, people in low-income nations have an incentive to generate AI slop to earn what is a pittance in developed nations. The barrier to entry is low--anyone can produce veritable mountains of AI slop with free tools and low-cost bandwidth--and the gains, however modest, are welcome if paid work is scarce. The same \"make it up on volume\" approach incentivizes churning out millions of phishing and spam SMS, emails and posts on every platform under the sun. If there's only one sucker per 10,000 entreaties, then send out 10 million. Since views and engagement generate income, the more outrageous the clickbait, the better. And of course, the greater the volume of clickbait, the greater the income stream flowing to platforms hosting the clickbait. AI tools incentivize creating deep-fakes of celebrities' voices and personas which can then be deployed to con older Internet users who are often credulous enough to believe that yes, Owen Wilson is talking to me, see, it's him. Every legitimate institution is now a tripwire for phishing and spam. Your USPS package can't be delivered, here's your Social Security Statement, and so on. AI Search is broken, too. I couldn't find the original PropOrNot \"fake-news about fake-news\" list from 2016, and AI search concluded it was not available. Then a correspondent sent me a post on Zero Hedge which prominently displayed the entire original PropOrNot list. (oftwominds.com was on the list, thank you very much.) Washington Post Names Drudge, Zero Hedge, & Ron Paul As Anti-Clinton \"Sophisticated Russian Propaganda Tools\" (November 25, 2016) The burden of shadow work required to delete, unsubscribe and purge our lives of all this sewage is growing heavier by the day. This calls to mind the boiled-frog analogy: we're frogs in a pot that's being heated so gradually that we no longer notice the sewage is extinguishing the utility of the Web. And the reason is--drum roll--that's how everyone makes money: views, engagement, scams, cons, fraud and above all, sheer volume. And who makes money from volume? The Big Tech platforms. So what if it's misleading AI slop, deep-fake scams or clickbait, the more \"engagement\" we get, the more money we make. So where's the incentive to staunch the flood of sewage? There isn't one. The incentive is to shrug and let the user sort it out by burning their own time. If we want a different outcome, we have to change the incentives. * * * Check out my new book Ultra-Processed Life and my updated Books and Films.
