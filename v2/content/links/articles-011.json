    "summary": "China's Grip On Critical Minerals Disrupts U.S. Defense Supply Chain div property=\"schema:text\" class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-te",
    "fullContent": "China's Grip On Critical Minerals Disrupts U.S. Defense Supply Chain In 2023, Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes warned that Beijing effectively has the US military's supply chain by the balls, thanks to America's reliance on rare earths and other materials which either come from, or are processed in, China. F-35 Lightning II jet (Adobe Stock) According to Hayes, Raytheon has \"several thousand suppliers in China,\" because of which \"decoupling ... is impossible.\" \"We can de-risk but not decouple,\" he told the Financial Times, adding that he thinks this is the case \"for everybody.\" \"Think about the $500bn of trade that goes from China to the US every year. More than 95 per cent of rare earth materials or metals come from, or are processed in, China. There is no alternative,\" he said. Fast forward two years later - and China’s recent curbs on the export of critical minerals are rippling through the U.S. defense supply chain, slowing production schedules and sending manufacturers on a global search for scarce materials needed in everything from munitions to fighter jets. (And of course, last month ZeroHedge premium subs were treated to \"The Coming Rare Earth Revolution And How To Profit\" - full of names that have exploded higher since publication...) In short, amid a surge in U.S.-China trade tensions earlier this year, Beijing tightened its control over rare earth exports. Those shipments resumed after the Trump administration reached a set of trade concessions in June, however China has kept a firm hold on materials destined for defense use. Accounting for roughly 90 percent of the world’s rare earth output - and dominating the supply of other strategic minerals - China has also barred the sale of germanium, gallium and antimony to the United States since December. The three metals are essential for bullet hardening, night-vision optics and other military applications, the WSJ reports. A Ukrainian soldier using night-vision goggles during a mission in 2023. Photo: Felipe Dana/AP Some contractors warn that their reserves are running dangerously low. Bill Lynn, chief executive of Leonardo DRS, said Wednesday that his company’s supply of germanium has fallen to “safety stock” levels. The metal is used in infrared sensors for missiles and other systems. “In order to sustain timely product deliveries, material flow must improve in the second half” of 2025, he told investors. Leonardo DRS, a U.S. subsidiary of Italy’s Leonardo, is exploring alternative suppliers and possible substitutes. For others, the bottleneck has already meant missed deadlines. One drone-parts maker supplying the U.S. military delayed orders by as much as two months while hunting for non-Chinese sources of magnets, which are produced from rare earth elements. Traders say prices for some materials have multiplied several times over; samarium, used in high-temperature magnets for jet engines, has been offered at 60 times its typical price. The Pentagon has instructed defense contractors to phase out magnets containing Chinese minerals by 2027. While some firms have stockpiled magnets, most carry only months of supply for other critical materials. Smaller drone manufacturers — often startups with limited resources — are considered especially exposed. Dak Hardwick, vice president of international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, said the problem is discussed constantly within the industry. “I can tell you…we talk about this daily and our companies talk about it daily,” he said. A recent analysis by defense software firm Govini found that more than 80,000 components used in U.S. weapons systems contain minerals now under Chinese export controls. Nearly all such supply chains depend on at least one Chinese source. Western buyers say Chinese authorities have begun demanding detailed disclosures - including images of products and production lines - before approving shipments. In May, New Hampshire-based ePropelled received such requests from a Chinese magnet supplier, along with a list of questions about its customers and assurances the magnets would not be used for military purposes. “Of course we are not going to provide the Chinese government with that information,” said Chris Thompson, the firm’s vice president of global sales. When the company refused, shipments stopped, extending delivery times to twice their usual length. The firm turned to suppliers in the United States, Europe, Japan and Taiwan, as well as to emerging producers Vulcan Elements in North Carolina and USA Rare Earth in Oklahoma. Those new sources are not expected to deliver until later this year and will need to develop non-Chinese supply chains of their own. Washington has begun to respond. The Pentagon has invested in expanding domestic output, including a $14 million grant last year to a Canadian firm producing germanium substrates for defense satellites and a $400 million stake in MP Materials, which operates the largest rare-earth mine in the Americas. On an earnings call, Lockheed Martin CEO James Taiclet described the MP Materials deal as “groundbreaking” for securing magnets needed in F-35 fighters and cruise missiles. Nicholas Myers, CEO of Massachusetts-based Phoenix Tailings, said large defense companies are now moving aggressively to secure their own mineral supplies. “They recognize that they’re just not going to get the magnets… unless they get involved,” he said. Beijing’s hard line is also affecting shipments in transit. Earlier this year, United States Antimony Corporation attempted to route 55 metric tons of Australian-mined antimony to its Mexican smelter via the Chinese port of Ningbo, a process it had used before without incident. In April, Chinese customs officials held the cargo for three months, eventually releasing it only on the condition it be returned to Australia. When it arrived, company CEO Gary Evans said the seals had been broken. “The shipping company, everyone who was involved, they’d never seen this happen before,” he said.

    "fullContent": "Huge Drug And Weapons Haul In French Polynesia Echoes Kash Patel's Warnings Authored by Rex Wilderstrom via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), While countering Beijing’s influence in the Pacific was chief among the reasons given by FBI Director Kash Patel when he opened the agency’s new office in Wellington last week, both he and New Zealand’s security ministers also spoke of rising transnational crime affecting the region. The 11 Glock pistols and 22 magazines seized from the intercepted ship. OFAST/Comgend Polynésie Française In a statement, the U.S. Embassy in Wellington described the purpose of the new office as working “to investigate and disrupt a wide range of threats and criminal activities, including terrorism, cybercrime and fraud, organised crime and money laundering, child exploitation, and foreign intelligence threats.” The latest seizure of drugs and weapons in the region bears out the reality of that threat. Comgend Polynésie Française—the national police force of French Polynesia—has announced that it has seized a “historic” quantity of drugs with a total street value of €331 million (US$382.66 million) from a yacht caught in the Marquesas Islands, about 1,400 kilometres north of Tahiti. After towing it to Pape'ete, the capital of Tahiti, and dismantling it, over 700 kilograms of drugs were found concealed in the boat’s structure. In total, 1,646.8 kilograms of cocaine and 232.4 kilograms of methamphetamine were seized from the boat. They also discovered 11 Glock semi‑automatic pistols and 24 magazines. Shipment Believed to be Bound For Australia The yacht was believed to have left Mexico and to be headed to Australia via Tonga. The three men onboard, a German skipper and two Dutch nationals, remain in custody, local Public Prosecutor Solène Belaouar said in a statement on Aug. 2. The head of French Polynesia’s Customs Department, Serge Puccetti, told local media the shipment was not destined for French Polynesia. He said French authorities regularly share intelligence with law enforcement agencies in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Echoing Patel’s warning, he said the Pacific is now a major transit area between narcotic production in South America and users in Australia, which has emerged as a major market, as well as to New Zealand and Asia. Organised crime syndicates from Southeast Asia are also using the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea, as transit points to ship opium-based drugs and methamphetamines to the U.S. market. Smugglers were now using all kinds of transport modes: air, sea, onboard containers, and sailboats, Puccetti said. “On each of these vectors, we are vigilant,” he said. New Caledonia’s Divisional Head of Customs, Hervé Matho, told local media, “In terms of cocaine consumption, the U.S. market is now saturated. That’s why traffickers are searching for new markets, [in] Europe and, in the Pacific region, Australia and New Zealand.” Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 19:15",

    "fullContent": "Hey Canada, Your Failed Wildfire Management Is Poisoning America's Skies Representative John James, a Republican from Michigan, penned a blistering letter to Canadian leaders, warning their out-of-control wildfires are \"poisoning the air and threatening the health of millions across Michigan and the Midwest.\" Now, that toxic smoke is pouring into the Northeast, and soon, into New York City. Just when many thought Justin Trudeau's leadership was disastrous, the beginning of the globalist Mark Carney era suggests things can and will likely get even worse. Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record. Government data shows 4,00 wildfires have been recorded so far this year. \"Despite the clear public health crisis, Canadian officials have shown alarming disregard,\" Rep. James wrote in a press release, informing his constituents about the letter he fired off to Canadian leaders, urging immediate action to contain the growing wildfire crisis that is poisoning America's air. If Canada's globalist 'green' leaders actually cared about the planet, they would have practiced proper forest management. But they didn't, and they failed miserably. Rep. James noted that the 2023 wildfire season in Canada was equivalent to \"running over 500 million cars for a full year.\" At the moment, smoke from 740 Canadian wildfires is spreading south and degrading air quality over a massive stretch of North America. New York City is under air-quality alerts... \"This lack of urgency undermines decades of cross-border cooperation and damages the U.S.—Canada relationship,\" Rep. James said. The bigger question is whether these forest fires are truly natural ... or part of a broader form of hybrid warfare. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 18:50",

    "fullContent": "VDH: Trump's Unknown Frontiers Authored by Victor Davis Hanson via American Greatness, Donald Trump’s far-ranging counter-revolution, to quote the old Star Trek mission statement, seeks “To boldly go where no one has gone before.” Because no conservative president has dared to question the last 70 years of progressive cultural, social, economic, and political dominance, all traditional wisdom, all our renowned “experts,” and all the self-described “authorities” have no real credibility in their mostly flawed analyses and wrong prognoses. Read what our legacy media predicted in March for this summer’s economy, or in January for the future of the border, or what would happen should the U.S. Air Force enter Iranian airspace. Take the border. “Comprehensive immigration reform” (a euphemism for rolling amnesties and a still-open border) was the establishment’s answer to 10,000 foreign nationals storming the border during peak surges of the Biden administration. But no president had ever simultaneously: 1) pressured Mexico to close its borders and patrol ours, 2) announced a plan to complete a border wall along the entire US-Mexico boundary, 3) stopped catch-and-release, 4) ceased refugee applications after illegally entering the U.S., 5) introduced policies encouraging voluntary self-deportation, and 6) prevented all illegal entries at the border. The result is that we do not know the full effects of these combined border policies. So far, one million foreign nationals have lost jobs, and 2 million Americans have gained them since Trump’s inauguration. How much money will be saved in local, state, and federal entitlements if illegal immigrants return home? How much trauma and costs will be avoided if 500,000 criminal aliens are deported? How many serious and lethal hit-and-run accidents will be prevented? To what degree will the idea of citizenship be reenergized once it is not reduced to the equivalency of mere residence? How many emergency rooms will have more space for U.S. citizens? No one knows, but the consequences could be enormous. The U.S. has never applied so many tariffs in so many ways upon so many goods from so many countries. As a result, economists have sworn since March that we are headed to a recession, stock collapse, stagflation, and high unemployment. But do they really know the profit margins of our mercantile importers, who tariff our goods but expect easy entry for their exports to the U.S.? Can importers pay a 15% tariff, still make a handsome profit, and not raise costs excessively on the U.S. consumer? If trade surpluses do not matter and tariffs hurt those who implement them, why do sophisticated Europeans, adroit Japanese, and smart Chinese prefer surpluses and tariffs to our deficits and zero or low tariffs? Are they on to something? Do moderate tariffs encourage rather than retard American enterprise, on the theory that it will not be undercut by dumping and exchange manipulation and can also compete with far cheaper energy and transportation costs? No one really knows these answers because the U.S. has never tried the current policy in quite the present way before. We do know that the radical free trade and asymmetrical tariffs of the last half-century empowered China to world power status with a dangerous military and hollowed out the U.S. industrial interior. Is the $2 trillion budget deficit, as predicted, set in stone? Will the national debt only grow to unsustainable levels? However, federal agencies have never announced annual cuts of nearly $200 billion—along with a ten percent reduction in the budget deficit. Never has the government promised to deregulate and fast-track permits for construction, energy development, and manufacturing from 2-3 years to mere months. What will the financial results be? Interior Secretary Doug Burgum suggests that $15 trillion in new foreign investments are now promised. If accurate, what will such influxes do to employment? To federal revenues? To the economy in general? Is it possible that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could be right that $300 billion in federal income will come from new tariffs—if true, that might reduce the deficit by another 15 percent? What is the effect on the economy of cheaper energy costs when production is slated to rise without draining the strategic petroleum reserve on the eve of elections? No one has ever questioned universities before so systematically. We do know that student loan debt has spiraled to $1.7 trillion. Graduation rates have dropped to about 50-60 percent of those who enroll. The average student now takes six—not four—years to graduate. Today’s graduates, by all accounts, leave universities with fewer analytical skills, less language fluency, and reduced general knowledge than in past decades. Faculties have never been more weaponized, with 90-95 percent reportedly holding progressive views. If universities are taxed on their endowments, will that not force them to reconsider their efforts to maintain their non-profit status? Will 15 percent limits on overhead charges on federal grants force researchers to watch their budgets and universities to curb their bloated administrative legions? What is so wrong with curbing the tuition gouging and profiteering off foreign students, and limiting their numbers to ensure access to underserved, deserving Americans? Will the end of segregated dorms, safe spaces, and “affinity” graduations lead to more integration and assimilation than do the current tribal fixations on race and ethnicity? Historically, does tribalism or assimilation best serve a nation? Will meritocratic admissions improve student skills, rewarding those who study hard and encouraging those who do not to emulate those who do? Will minorities who are admitted under meritocratic criteria be seen as more or less qualified? Are far fewer administrators, more emphasis on instruction and less on politics, and more students from the heartland and fewer from communist China or the illiberal Middle East such bad things? In the last 50 years, affirmative action transmogrified into DEI racial separatism, chauvinism, and a system of reparatory spoils, played and manipulated by grifters, opportunists, and fakers, from Elizabeth Warren-style phonies and Jussie Smollett-like con artists to opportunists like Zohran Mamdani who game the system. Has any chauvinistic multiracial democracy—like Brazil or India—or any multiethnic or multireligious confederation—such as Lebanon, the former Yugoslavia, or Iraq—ever succeeded by prioritizing caste, race, religious sectarianism, or ethnic tribalism? Can any top-down imposed policy ever be successful when 70 percent of the electorate opposes it? Can any government that institutionalizes bias and preferences succeed while ignoring class in favor of race—without ever clearly defining which racial criteria justify the entire spoils system, or why? In our postmodern 21st-century system, no one knows exactly what will happen when race becomes incidental rather than essential. But we do know from history where we were headed under the current aberrant system. Abroad, in the last 30 years, NATO was voluntarily hollowed out—largely praised in the abstract by European grandees and shorted and ignored in the concrete by Euro budget technocrats. Yet since the days of the Cold War, NATO members had not met their defense expenditure promises. Now, most NATO members have met those commitments. Frontline NATO states like Sweden, Finland, and Poland are far better armed and prepared than legacy Western members like Belgium, Spain, or Italy. If there follows a rearmed and recommitted NATO, will not the world become a safer place? We were told for a half-century to steer clear of Iran, the supposed unhinged, lethal bully of the Middle East. Their henchmen blew up barracks and embassies, took and executed hostages, and sowed terror throughout the Middle East with their killer surrogates Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis. But Iran had never really fought, much less won a war, since it pleaded with Saddam Hussein for an armistice from the catastrophic Iran-Iraq conflict. What will be the effect on the Middle East with a currently impotent Iran, an inert Hezbollah, and a subterranean Hamas in hiding? More importantly, what is the current regional role of Iran without a nuclear program, air defenses, a navy, or expeditionary terrorist forces? Again, no one knows. Finally, we have never seen anything quite so radical as the new Democratic Party, at least not since the McGovern blowout of 1972. In its 24/7, 360-degree fixation on hating Donald Trump and his MAGA agenda, rarely has a party embraced signature policies that are so despised by the American people. As a result, we have no idea what the result will be other than a national implosion at the polls. Why would any political party embrace open borders, the influx of 12 million illegal aliens, 600 sanctuary cities, biological men dominating women’s sports, dismantling the oil, gas, coal, and nuclear industries, prosecutors who release rather than indict and convict violent criminals, defunding the police, tribal fixations and racial spoils systems in defiance of the Supreme Court, the terrorists of Hamas over democratic Israel, and overt campus anti-Semitism? We are in the middle of a counter-revolution, whose fate will likely be decided in 15 months by the midterm elections and the status of the late 2026 economy. Structural changes across the economy, culture, and politics of the country are underway. Our bicoastal experts and authorities are mostly predicting a multifaceted systems failure—without explaining why or how. Yet the only constant in their predictions is that when and if they prove wrong, they will not pivot, correct, or apologize, but simply move on to their next flawed prognosis, fortified by their titles and letters after their names—but otherwise little else.

The filing highlights New America’s strategy to target companies that “play a pivotal role in rejuvenating domestic manufacturing, fostering innovation ecosystems, and securing critical supply chains.” The venture will be led by Kevin McGurn, a seasoned technology executive, with Kyle Wool serving as an adviser. The offering is underwritten by investment banks D. Boral Capital and Dominari Securities, the latter a subsidiary of the firm where Wool holds a leadership role. This marks the Trump brothers’ latest foray into the SPAC market, building on prior ventures. Last year, Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent of Truth Social, went public via a SPAC merger. More recently, GrabAGun, an online firearms retailer backed by 1789 Capital—where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner—also completed a SPAC deal. The move aligns with President Donald Trump’s “America First” policies, which emphasize reshoring critical supply chains from China to enhance U.S. economic and national security. The administration has implemented sweeping tariffs, including a 10% baseline on imports from all countries and rates up to 125% on Chinese goods, to make foreign products costlier and encourage domestic production. These measures, enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, aim to address trade imbalances and bolster U.S. manufacturing. In May, U.S. and Chinese negotiators reached a 90-day tariff truce in Geneva, easing trade tensions. The agreement reduced U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% and China’s duties from 125% to 10%, providing temporary relief to businesses navigating global trade disruptions. The tariff policies have drawn support from U.S. industries, particularly steel. Nucor Corp., a leading steel producer, endorsed the measures. “Nucor strongly commends the actions taken today by President Trump to reimpose tariffs on all steel imports,” said Leon Topalian, president and CEO of Nucor Corp. “America’s national security depends on a robust and healthy American steel industry, which continues to be harmed by massive global steel overcapacity and the resulting surge of illegally dumped and subsidized imports from around the world. \"Many of our trading partners have taken advantage of our open market for far too long and have intentionally circumvented our trade laws or allowed other bad actors to transship illegally dumped and subsidized steel,\" Topalian added. \"The President’s actions will help level the playing field for American steel producers and the more than 24,000 men and women who work in our industry.” Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 18:00",

    "fullContent": "Dead? Or Just 'Mostly' Dead? Authored by Madelynn McLaughlin via RealClearPolitics, Until recently, anyone who believed there was anything fishy about the U.S. organ donation system was labeled a conspiracy theorist. Yet now the old adage: “What’s the difference between conspiracy and truth? About six months,” rings true again, as so-called conspiracy theorists have been proven right by none other than the federal Health and Resources Services Administration (HRSA) itself. The “conspiracy?” That organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and hospitals declare living individuals dead in order to harvest their organs. The truth? In March 2025, the federal Health Resources and Services Administration reported in its investigation of a procurement organization called Network for Hope that there had been dozens of instances where organ retrieval was nearly begun despite the donors exhibiting signs of life. The investigation was started in response to the infamous case of T. J. Hoover. Hoover, a resident of Kentucky (which along with parts of Ohio and West Virginia is exclusively served by Network for Hope) had overdosed on drugs in October 2021 and been declared brain dead. His body was being prepped for organ retrieval when he regained consciousness on the operating table, banging his legs and crying. Thankfully, the process was halted, but not without significant pressure to continue by the OPO representative in the room, according to doctors who testified. Hoover’s story is apparently one among many. HRSA reviewed 351 donation-authorized cases and found that 73 patients showed neurological activity and at least 28 patients may not have been deceased when the procurement process began. These shocking revelations led to a hearing last week by the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Dr. Raymond Lynch, chief of the organ transplant branch within HRSA, testified to Congress regarding the safety and efficiency of the organ donation process. Lynch admitted that the current method of operation has serious issues, but argued that the root cause is a system that grants a quasi-monopoly to individual procurement operators. Only a single contractor per region can service the OPTN, which is the federal Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network that connects donated organs with patients needing transplants. Over-reliance on the OPOs has impeded “meaningful government oversight,” according to Lynch. Members of both parties peppered Lynch with questions about the practices of OPOs and the OPTN. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat, referenced a New York Times article revealing the growing use of “circulatory death,” which is defined as the irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, even though in some cases circulatory death is reversible through proper resuscitation. Nonetheless, using this definition to determine the end of life allowed hospitals to harvest organs faster, leading to concerns about a grim conflict of interest. Compounding this issue is pressure from OPO representatives, who are required to be present for donation. DeGette asserted that doctors may look to OPO representatives as “experts” and feel pressured to certify death. While Lynch did not affirm DeGette’s concerns, he conceded that “increased emphasis on performance in any area of medicine is not an excuse for noncompliance.” Lynch stressed that it is possible that a “good faith” assessment of death could be wrong, and that often, doctors are doing their best in a difficult and fast-paced environment. Rep. Gary Palmer wasn’t having it. “There’s clearly things that happened that I think could count as euthanasia,” said the Alabama Republican. In response, Lynch stressed that the HRSA has a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) in place for OPOs and the OPTN, with its authority stemming from Congress. The renewed interest in Congress follows passage of the Securing the OPTN Act, signed into law by President Biden two years ago. This new law the OPTN turns a single-vendor system into a multiple-vendor system, meaning that multiple OPOs can now service the same region. It also establishes a separate OPTN board from any other contractors to ensure transparency, removes the $7 million HRSA funding cap and allocates more money for modernization, and requires a GAO review of the OPTN’s financial history. The HRSA created its CAP to better implement the terms of the act. The CAP lists several important reforms: Any staff member will be allowed to halt procedures due to safety concerns; the OPTN must now monitor and report safety-related halted donations; the HRSA now has authority to decertify OPOs not meeting its standards; and the Network for Hope and any other implicated OPO must implement minimum safety standards, better documentation, clearer donor eligibility criteria, and family communication plans within six months. While the reforms listed in the CAP are unquestionably needed, a big question remains: Will they truly solve the problem? It will be an uphill fight. The CAP doesn’t address the issue of ambiguous death certification, such as circulatory death. Nor does it address the institutional incentives that push OPOs to aggressively advocate for more organ donations. CAPs tend to focus more on metrics rather than ethical gray zones, meaning that the potential of harvesting the organs of live patients is still a possibility. What needs to change to ensure that what T. J. Hoover endured – or worse – never happens again? Those pushing for further reform believe that the Uniform Determination of Death Act should be further strengthened so that that hospitals in this country operate by uniform and widely accepted standards for certification of death. Independent third-party certification of death might be a brake on misplaced priorities. Finally, some believe that harvesting organs should not be allowed until all brain activity has ceased.

    "fullContent": "Tyson Foods Confirms Protein Switching Underway Amid Record High Beef Prices Mega meatpacker Tyson Foods surged 4% in early New York cash trading after posting a surprise quarterly profit and raising its full-year revenue forecast. A boom in chicken demand offset deepening losses in its struggling beef unit, as sky-high beef prices continue to push consumers toward cheaper alternatives. Tyson Foods reported third-quarter adjusted EPS of .91 cents, beating Goldman Sachs and consensus estimates of 85 cents and 78 cents, respectively. Revenue rose 3.6% year-over-year to $13.88 billion, also topping estimates of $13.61 billion (GS) and $13.50 billion (consensus), driven by strong performance in chicken, offsetting losses in the beef unit. Tyson Foods (TSN) 3Q Summary: Beat and Raised EPS Beat: Adj. EPS of $0.91 vs. GS/consensus of $0.85/$0.78 Revenue Beat: Sales rose +3.6% YoY to $13.88B, above GS/consensus of $13.61B/$13.50B Segment Performance: Strength in Chicken, Beef, Prepared Foods; Pork and International/Other underperformed Operating Income: Adj. op income of $505M beat GS/consensus of $501M/$462M Guidance Raised: FY25 Adj. Operating Income: Now $2.1B–$2.3B (up from $1.9B–$2.3B), led by chicken strength, partially offset by beef FY25 Net Sales Growth: Now +2–3% (prior: flat to +1%), above GS/consensus of 1.5%/1.2% \"Our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our multi-protein, multi-channel portfolio and our relentless focus on operational excellence,\" said Donnie King, President & CEO of Tyson Foods. \"Delivering our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth across sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share underscores the resilience of our business model. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to meet consumer needs, capitalize on protein demand and deliver long-term value to our shareholders.\" \"Chicken continues to provide support to the business as the company continues to face beef headwinds,\" analysts at brokerage Stephens wrote in a note to clients. Making sense of all this is simple: rising chicken demand alongside sliding beef demand is known as \"protein switching.\" This trend is driven by excessively high supermarket beef prices, prompting low- and middle-income consumers to seek cheaper alternatives like chicken and pork.

    "fullContent": "District Attorney's Office Announces Largest Gun Trafficking Case In County History Authored by Oliver Mantyk via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), On Aug. 1, District Attorney David Hoovler gave a press conference along with other politicians and members of law enforcement on the success of the largest gun trafficking case in county history. Confiscated guns and narcotics on display at a press conference in Goshen, N.Y., regarding Operation Powder Burn on Aug. 1, 2025. Oliver Mantyk/The Epoch Times The operation, dubbed Operation Powder Burn, focused on taking down an illegal gun and narcotics trafficking ring based in Newburgh. The operation resulted in firearm, narcotics, and conspiracy charges against 20 individuals. Their ages range from 22 to 60, and they live mainly in New York, with some in Pennsylvania and Georgia. The severity of the charges range from probation to 15 to 30 years in prison. Ten of the individuals being charged are bail-eligible. The trafficking revolved around an “Iron Pipeline,” a gun trafficking route moving guns between states with differing gun laws. Most of the guns were shipped from Georgia or Pennsylvania via FedEx, where they were allegedly received by the investigation’s main focus, Christopher Brown, a 40-year-old resident of Newburgh. He operated out of a closed restaurant in Newburgh called The Kitchen, allegedly selling narcotics and firearms in and outside of the city. Investigations into Brown and people connected to him started in December 2024. What began as a small narcotics investigation by the OC Drug Task Force, over the course of eight months, turned into the largest gun trafficking bust by volume of firearms involved. Undercover officers bought a total of 55 firearms and 700 grams of cocaine and fentanyl from Brown. The $69,000 used to make these purchases was provided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). The ATF also provided other resources and personnel for the investigation. The individuals were arrested on July 30, which was dubbed “Takedown Day.” The decision to end the investigation came after law enforcement intercepted messages indicating that Brown and his associates were planning on robbing and doing potential harm to the undercover officers. Takedown Day involved more than 20 law enforcement agencies and 300 officers in New York, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. The day ended with 19 of the 20 persons of interest in the hands of law enforcement. On Takedown Day, 12 illegal firearms, 4 ounces of fentanyl, 0.5 kilograms of cocaine, and $65,000 were confiscated. A large amount of synthetic marijuana was also taken by law enforcement. No officers were injured in the eight-month operation. Operation Powder Burn ended with the recovery of a total of 67 illegal guns and 1.5 kilos of cocaine and fentanyl. The guns trafficked were mostly handguns, but shotguns, rifles, and other larger firearms were also trafficked. The collection included several 3D-printed guns and a Glock handgun modified to be fully automatic. That is the only known automatic weapon among the confiscated guns. The guns and narcotics were on display at the conference. Several of the confiscated firearms are allegedly linked to shootings, including seven shootings in New York and Vermont. Hoovler said at the conference, “There is enough fentanyl here on this table to kill 190,000 residents of Orange County. The 20 people on the boards to my immediate left are nothing more than merchants of death.” Hoovler also wanted people to be clear that this case wasn’t about gun enthusiasts or other law-abiding gun owners; it was about people bringing guns to OC as part of the illegal drug trade. Orange County Sheriff Paul Arteta said in a press release, “These weren’t isolated offenses; they were part of a coordinated effort to profit off addiction and violence. Our teams, including the Special Operations Group and Drug Task Force, worked with precision and persistence to shut this network down. I’m proud of the role the Sheriff’s Office played in this historic case, and we remain committed to pursuing those who threaten the safety and stability of our communities.” A poster outlining the alleged connections between suspects involved in a firearms trafficking bust called Operation Powder Burn at a press conference in Goshen, N.Y., on Aug. 1, 2025.
