    "fullContent": "Mexico's President Draws Red Line: US Kinetic Operations Against Drug Cartels Not Welcome On Her Soil Following a New York Times report that President Trump has issued a directive authorizing the Department of Defense (DoD) to conduct direct military operations against certain Latin American drug cartels designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs), Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly rejected any U.S. military presence on Mexican soil. \"The United States is not going to come to Mexico with the military. We cooperate, we collaborate, but there is not going to be an invasion. That is ruled out, absolutely ruled out,\" Sheinbaum said, who was quoted by a new NYT report. She added that her administration would review Trump's order. She emphasized, \"It is not part of any agreement, far from it. When it has been brought up, we have always said no.\" Trump's hemispheric defense push to secure the Americas has been to target drug cartels designated as FTOs. These targets include Cartel de los Soles, Tren de Aragua, and Sinaloa Cartel. The aim here is to disrupt the financial command and control nodes first, which is underway, then the physical structure of these organizations, all to break the flow of fentanyl and human trafficking into the U.S. through the southern border. Mexican officials claim they had no advance warning of Trump's directive. However, Sheinbaum said U.S. counterparts had hinted that they would deploy U.S. forces for capture/kill missions, maritime interdictions, and cross-border SOF raids against high-value cartel targets. Trump's new directive signals a hardened approach to ending the fentanyl crisis, mainly driven by FTOs in Mexico supplied with precursor chemicals from China. This drug death crisis claims more than 100,000 American lives each year and has become a central mandate for Trump to address. This crisis, exacerbated by the Biden-Harris regime's globalist, open-border, nation-killing policies, amounts to what some believe is hybrid warfare waged by the Chinese Communist Party. The U.S. president is now moving to put a stop to this chemical warfare on its citizens. Here's more from NYT's report: It remains unclear what plans the Pentagon is drawing up for possible action, and the order raises a range of legal questions. It is also unclear what notice the Mexican government had: Although Ms. Sheinbaum said U.S. officials had told her and her team that the directive \"was coming,\" three people familiar with the matter said Mexican officials had been blindsided. Depending on what the United States does, Mexico could pull back its cooperation on issues like security and migration, those people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations. For months, Mexican officials have in public and in private rejected suggestions of U.S. military action against drug cartels on Mexican territory. The issue of U.S. military action has long raised hackles in Latin America, where the United States' history of interventions goes back well over a century. Arturo Rocha, who resigned late last year from the Mexican foreign ministry, commented on the Trump's new directive, stating, \"They need Mexico's cooperation and they need Mexico's state and society to be functioning. This isn't Afghanistan, where the state is broken, and you can do whatever you want as there's a void.\" \"This has always been Mexico's deepest fear, this constant sense that we could be invaded by the U.S. again,\" Rocha added. \"It would have major implications in terms of cooperation with the U.S. going forward. The president has been clear that our sovereignty is a redline.\" The drug war in Mexico has been chiefly led by the Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration. But now the DoD appears to be getting involved, and U.S. military involvement across Latin America could spark geopolitical fallout with any country that doesn't agree to participate in cleaning up FTO drug cartels. Mexican banks may soon face U.S. sanctions to disrupt cartel money laundering operations. Trump has a mandate from the American people to stop the drug death crisis; a crisis that, for some reason, globalist Democrats allowed to accelerate through open borders and failed progressive policies on the city, state, and local level that have transformed some parts of U.S. cities into crime-ridden hellholes.

    "fullContent": "European Leaders Call For Protection Of Ukraine As Trump-Putin Summit Looms Authored by T.J.Muscaro via The Epoch Times, A coalition of European leaders released a joint statement on Aug. 9 welcoming the news of President Donald Trump’s upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, and stressing the need to ensure that European and Ukrainian interests are protected as the two leaders talk about ending the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Trump and Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska on Aug. 15. The joint statement included French, Italian, German, Polish, British, and Finnish leaders, as well as the president of the European Commission. “We share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests,” the leaders said, adding that they “agree that these vital interests include the need for robust and credible security guarantees that enable Ukraine to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.” They also expressed support for the principle that “international borders must not be changed by force.” “The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,” the statement said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement on Aug. 9 that “the Ukrainian people deserve peace.” “But all partners must understand what a dignified peace is,” he said, adding that Ukraine “will not reward Russia for what it has perpetrated.” Trump has said a deal could involve “some swapping of territories to the betterment of both” parties. After speaking with Zelenskyy, as well as German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron took to X. “Ukraine’s future cannot be decided without the Ukrainians, who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now,” he wrote. “Europeans will also necessarily be part of the solution, as their own security is at stake.” The Trump–Putin meeting will follow White House special envoy Steve Witkoff’s visit to Moscow on Aug. 6, during which time Witkoff met with Putin for three hours of talks. Details of their discussion have not been disclosed. “President Putin, I believe, wants to see peace. And Zelenskyy wants to see peace,” Trump said on Aug. 8. “Now President Zelenskyy has to get … everything he needs because he is going to have to get ready to sign something, and I think he is working hard to get that done.” It also follows a meeting between Vice President JD Vance and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, as well as representatives of European allies and Ukraine, on Aug. 9 at Chevening House, a mansion outside of London, to discuss Trump’s peace push.

    "fullContent": "Mapping Data Center Capacity Around The World Today, the U.S. leads globally in data center capacity by a wide margin. Driven by hyperscalers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, billions in investment are supporting foundational AI models. As this momentum continues, these tech giants are expected to remain key drivers of global data center growth. This graphic, via Visual Capitalist's Dorothy Neufeld, shows data center capacity by region, based on data from the IEA. The Global Concentration of Data Center Infrastructure Below, we show data center capacity worldwide in 2024: ​​ With 53.7 GW of installed capacity, the U.S. accounts for 44% of the global total. Given the intensifying demand for data centers, hyperscalers are facing infrastructure constraints. New data centers set to be built out by 2028 are completely booked, and Northern Virginia faces power capacity shortages causing project delays. Meanwhile, public and private entities in China have invested billions in data centers, but an estimated 80% of new infrastructure stands unused. As we can see, the EU trails behind with 11.9 GW of capacity. Still, electricity demand from data centers is expected to surge 150% by 2035, driven by approximately $231 billion in AI-related investment aimed at tripling capacity by 2032. To learn more about data centers from a capacity perspective, check out this graphic on historical growth since 2005. Tyler Durden Sun, 08/10/2025 - 08:45",

    "fullContent": "London Train Passengers Eject, Detain Deranged Man Exposing Genitals In Front Of Children Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news, Passengers on a TFL train in London took matters into their own hands as a deranged lunatic completely exposed his genitals to the entire carriage, which contained children, then exploded into a rage when he was told to get off the train. Video shows that the guy pulled down his pants for all to see and just stood there on the on Hammersmith and City line train in the middle of the afternoon. When the guy was challenged by a male passenger, and told to pull up his pants or get off the train, he began repeatedly and aggressively screaming “F**K OFF.” Why do we have to put up with this? https://t.co/srtqGxIYqc — m o d e r n i t y (@ModernityNews) August 8, 2025 “What do you mean f**k off? You need to get off the f**king train. Now. There are kids on here,” the passenger responded. The half naked guy then continued to yell and wave his own belt around, prompting more male passengers to step in and begin delivering what can only be described as an ass whipping. As the train came to a stop at a station, the passengers threw the lunatic to the platform where one of them detained him. British Transport Police issued a statement saying the man has been detained under the Mental Health Act. “Officers were called to reports of a man exposing himself on the District Line at East Ham Underground station,” the statement reads, adding “The man had been assaulted by a number of other passengers and was initially arrested by an off duty officer, before being detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to hospital, where he remains.” “An investigation into the incident is ongoing,” the statement concludes. I'm amazed the cops didn't arrest the men who complained and threw him off the train. — Maggie MAC (@MaggieM77391666) August 8, 2025 Watch this space… Instead of calling this what is was, a deranged potentially dangerous lunatic exposing himself and being dealt with accordingly, sections of the media and leftists online have decided to frame it as an attack on a a person having a “mental health crisis.” Fix this headline… pic.twitter.com/h8XJ7EjQrh — m o d e r n i t y (@ModernityNews) August 8, 2025 This My London article claims “A man in a mental health crisis was beaten by members of the public,” describing the the man as “visibly appearing in distress.” Others online complained about how the “crisis” guy was dealt with. Nudity on public transport is unacceptable. The man in the viral video is clearly suffering a psychotic episode and the violence he received is excessive. — Alexander Bramham (@BramhamAlex) August 8, 2025 “Calmly restrain” 😂😂😂😂 Excuse me naked man, do I have consent to touch you? Ok I’m going to restrain you now, please get on the ground and put your hands behind your back. Thank you for complying sir, permission to touch you again? I just want to make sure you’re… — Migas (@ElixirDiablo) August 8, 2025 No, they tried to talk him. He cursed them. Then the men appropriately responded to the situation. I thank God for men like these in the video. As women we need to know our roles and know when to be quiet. The women who moved away from the situation had good judgment. Mental… — wOa (@TIHfirst) August 8, 2025 The safety of the vulnerable in our society — including children and the elderly — is more important than this misguided compassion you're proposing — Andrei Muntean (@_andreimuntean) August 8, 2025 Yes, he’s clearly full on mental, but what would you have the passengers do? Stroke his forehead? Sing him a lullaby? “It’s mental health” everything wrong with our society. Great to see people actually taking a stand protecting the rest of the passengers — Callum (@CLH_TEN) August 8, 2025 More of this needs to start happening instead of it being tolerated and allowed. He obviously had mental health issues but they did the right thing by subduing him so that he didn’t escalate into worse behavior, especially since there were kids on the train. — Mrs. S (@701Nurse) August 7, 2025 The London Evening Standard ran with the headline “Tube passengers attack naked man who exposed himself in front of children,” as if they started the incident. Attacked? They dealt with a threat — Pie1984Red (@Pie1984Red) August 8, 2025 He had plenty of warning before they attacked him. — ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (@PezD_Spencer) August 8, 2025 Attack? Justifiably deal with — Partridge (@NW5Arsenal) August 8, 2025 Are we just supposed to tolerate this behaviour? Indecent exposure should be tolerated then – is that your inference? think not the guy then screams FO at those who ask him to pull trousers up! Are we expected to tolerate this now? He persisted in front of women & children – appropriate citizens arrest done — Nicola Delglyn (@DelglynNicola) August 8, 2025 Unsurprisingly, others almost instantly started calling it a “racial” attack: Yeah so this is not how you handle a man having psychotic episode or bad drug trip on a train surrounded by vulnerable people. It’s actually the opposite way you should handle this. They made a bad situation several times worse. Also likely there was some racial aspect to this. https://t.co/HGQq9oFG6R — Economic relations? I hardly knew her! (@Jack_Witek) August 8, 2025 No doubt we’re going to hear more about this incident in the coming days. * * * Your support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.
