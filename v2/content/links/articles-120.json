    "fullContent": "Trump-Brokered Armenia–Azerbaijan Peace Deal Secures US Trade Route Authored by Emel Akan via The Epoch Times, President Donald Trump will host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan on Aug. 8 at the White House to sign a joint declaration ending four decades of hostility between the two nations. The accord also launches the “Trump Route,” a new transport corridor aimed at unlocking the region’s commercial potential, the White House said. During the meeting, the two countries will sign a joint declaration formalizing the agreement and establishing the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,” or TRIPP, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told reporters during a call previewing the meeting. “By locking in this path to peace, we are unlocking the great potential of the South Caucasus region in trade, transit, and energy flows,” Kelly said. Trump will also sign bilateral agreements with both countries that “span energy, technology, economic cooperation, border security, infrastructure, and trade,” she added. The new route will be a multimodal transit corridor linking mainland Azerbaijan and its Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, enhancing regional trade routes. The new route will allow goods to be moved from not just the Caucasus but also Central Asia without transiting through Russia, Iran, or China, according to the White House. “What President Trump has done is he’s taken the politics out of the picture and made common sense prevail,” a senior White House official said during the call. “What this will do for American businesses, and frankly, for energy resources across Europe, will be enormously powerful. “The losers here are China, Russia, and Iran. The winners here are the West.” Azerbaijan has long sought a transport corridor through Armenia to connect its main territory with Nakhchivan bordering Turkey. Under the agreement to be signed on Friday, Armenia will grant the United States exclusive long-term development rights to build a route through the southern part of Armenia. The U.S. government plans to delegate the project to a consortium to handle both infrastructure and management. The official said that Trump is going to sign on Aug. 8 a directive to “set up a TRIPP negotiating team” with talks expected to start “in the middle of next week.” The official noted that since the announcement yesterday morning, they had received calls from nine potential operators, including three American companies. “We’re going to get everybody around the table. We’re going to find the most first-class operating system,” the official said. In a Truth Social post on Aug. 7, Trump announced that he'd be hosting Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan for a “Historic Peace Summit” at the White House on Friday. “These two Nations have been at War for many years, resulting in the deaths of thousands of people. Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now,” Trump said, adding that his administration has been “engaged with both sides for quite some time.” The two nations have engaged in cross-border conflicts since the late 1980s. Early this year, U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff traveled to Azerbaijan and met with Aliyev. From February through mid-April, U.S. officials expressed significant concern about the potential for renewed hostilities between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Following Witkoff’s trip, a U.S. team conducted a series of five additional visits to the region, traveling between Azerbaijan and Armenia. During the meeting, the countries will also sign a joint letter officially requesting the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or OSCE, to dissolve the “no longer relevant Minsk Group,” according to the White House. The group, co-chaired by France, Russia, and the United States, was created in 1992 to find a peaceful solution to the Nagorno–Karabakh conflict. Tyler Durden Sat, 08/09/2025 - 07:00",

    "fullContent": "Hemispheric Defense: Trump Directs Military For Kinetic Ops Against Foreign Drug Cartels Per The New York Times reporting, President Trump has issued a new directive authorizing the Department of Defense (DoD) to conduct direct military operations against select Latin American drug cartels designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). This represents a major escalation in the administration's counter-cartel posture, moving beyond law enforcement and intelligence support to offensive kinetic missions. The directive, according to people familiar with the matter, provides legal cover for potential direct U.S. military operations at sea and on foreign soil, bypassing the traditional law enforcement framework. \"It signals Mr. Trump's continued willingness to use military forces to carry out what has primarily been considered a law enforcement responsibility to curb the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs,\" The New York Times wrote in the report. The move follows the deployment of active-duty and National Guard troops along the southern border, expanding surveillance via reconnaissance aircraft, and designating multiple cartels and gangs as FTOs, including Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, which the administration alleges is run by Nicolás Maduro. On Thursday, the U.S. increased its bounty on Maduro's capture to $50 million. Recently, the Treasury Department accused Cartel de los Soles of providing material support to Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. Both cartels have been designated as FTOs, which the Treasury said are \"threatening the peace and security of the United States.\" Trump administration lawyers, including the new Pentagon general counsel and head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, are expected to face early tests in determining what operations are legally permissible. NYT noted, \"Trump's new directive appears to envision a different approach, focused on U.S. forces directly capturing or killing people involved in the drug trade.\" Earlier this year, we provided readers with the understanding that the groundwork was being laid for these types of authorizations, including capture/kill missions, maritime interdictions, and cross-border SOF raids against high-value targets: USAF Spy Plane Runs SIGINT Operation Near Cabo As U.S. Preps For Potential Cartel Fight USAF Spy Jet Flies Second SIGINT Operation On US Border With Focus On Narco Hub Border Czar \"Expects\" Kinetic Warfare Between U.S. Troops & Mexican Drug Cartels U.S. Designates Mexican Cartels As \"Foreign Terrorists,\" Signaling Financial Warfare Looms US P-3B Orion Spy Plane Spotted Over Mexico As SIGINT Ops Target Cartels U.S. Special Forces Deploy To Mexico For \"Training\" Mission Following Spy Plane SIGINT Operations Trump Weighs Drone Strikes On Mexican Cartel Terrorists Amid Major Hemispheric Defense Push Trump Mulls Deploying Special Forces To Assassinate Mexican Drug Lords: Report Former Green Beret: Trump Can \"Turn Loose Delta Force\" On The Cartels Trump's target of cartels is an initiative that appears nested within a broader strategic framework referred to as \"Hemispheric Defense,\" aimed at securing the Western Hemisphere against transnational criminal gangs and Beijing. The primary objective will be to fracture cartel command-and-control nodes to disrupt fentanyl trafficking networks, particularly those dependent on precursor chemical shipments originating from China (hybrid warfare) that kill 100,000 Americans every year. It's likely that before the kinetic action begins, the U.S. Treasury will exert more financial pressure on these cartels to disrupt their financial networks. Source: Heritage Foundation If implemented, this directive marks a major doctrinal shift for the U.S. to secure the Western Hemisphere in a world fracturing into a dangerous bipolar state. There are risks that this action could spark diplomatic fallout with Mexico and other surrounding countries. Another risk is that cartels may retaliate with asymmetric attacks targeting U.S. personnel, diplomatic buildings, or infrastructure. What's worse is that the Biden-Harris regime of far-left globalists flooded the nation with cartel members. There is a coming storm. Tyler Durden Sat, 08/09/2025 - 06:00",
