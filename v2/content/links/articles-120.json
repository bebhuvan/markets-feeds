    "fullContent": "Tesla Board Approves 96 Million Share Stock Award To \"Retain\" Elon Musk Tesla's Board approved a special interim equity award for Elon Musk to compensate and retain him for \"extraordinary work\". \"As you know, Elon has not received meaningful compensation for eight years since the 2012 CEO Performance Award was last earned in 2017,\" Robyn Denholm & Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, Members of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, wrote in a letter to shareholders on Monday morning. The Board continued, \"Despite overwhelming support from you in 2018 and again in 2024, our legal efforts continue in the Delaware courts to reinstate the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\" The equity award of restricted stock, totaling 96 million shares, is equal to about one-third of the compensation he earned under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The award provides the following conditions: 96 million restricted shares of stock, subject to Elon paying a purchase price upon meeting a two-year vesting term, to be delivered after receipt of antitrust regulatory approval; The purchase price will be equal to the split adjusted exercise price of the stock options awarded to Elon under the 2018 CEO Performance Award ($23.34 per share); A requirement that Elon serve continuously in a senior leadership role at Tesla during the two-year vesting term; • A pledging allowance to cover tax payments or the purchase price; A mandatory holding period of five years from the grant date, except to cover tax payments or the purchase price (with any sales for such purposes to be conducted through an orderly disposition in coordination with Tesla); and If the Delaware courts fully reinstate the 2018 CEO Performance Award, this interim award will be forfeited or returned or a portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will be forfeited. To put it simply, there cannot be any \"double dip.\" Elon will not be able to keep this new award in addition to the options he will be awarded under the 2018 CEO Performance Award should the courts rule in our favor. Tesla is at a critical inflection point with slumping sales and Musk pivoting the company to focus on robotaxis, cheaper EV platforms, humanoid robots, and AI. \"While we recognize that Elon's business ventures, interests and other potential demands on his time and attention are extensive and wide-ranging, including his leadership roles at xAI, SpaceX, Neuralink, X Corp., and The Boring Company as well as his other interests, we are confident that this award will incentivize Elon to remain at Tesla and focus his unmatched leadership abilities on further creating shareholder value for Tesla shareholders and attracting and retaining talent at Tesla,\" the Board said. A Letter to Our Shareholders on the 2025 CEO Interim Award Dear Fellow Tesla Shareholders, Today we announce an important first step in compensating Elon Musk for his extraordinary work at Tesla. As you know, Elon has not received meaningful compensation for eight years since… — Tesla (@Tesla) August 4, 2025 . . . Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 07:20",

    "fullContent": "UPenn Student Paper: School Caving To Trump Admin Over Men In Women's Sports Is \"Fascism\" By Dave Huber of The College Fix The University of Pennsylvania student paper is very upset the school agreed to Trump administration demands regarding men’s participation in women’s sports — so much so it says UPenn is “descending into fascism” (its headline). The Daily Pennsylvanian Summer Opinion Editor Ingrid Holmquist and her summer-session cohorts say their editorial is not about the UPenn (women’s) swim team (and surrounding Lia Thomas controversy) nor “NCAA guidelines” or “biological sex characteristics.” Except that … it really is. “In allowing the federal government to make a decision that belongs to our community, Penn has violated our trust in a way that may be impossible to restore,” the editors write. “Our administration could have said no, fighting in court to keep the government out of our athletic policies.” Furthermore, UPenn made a deal with an administration that has “proven hostile to human rights,” and this agreement “affirmed the belief” for the university that Trump’s actions were “logical [and] legal.” “Throughout history, authoritarian regimes have begun their crackdowns with an attack on universities — beacons of dissent and social progress,” the editors continue. “We can’t ignore the warning signs. Penn’s actions are exactly what it looks like to give in to extortion disguised as governance.” Hostile to human rights? The Ivy Leaguers’ proof: a link to the notoriously centrist (ha ha) Amnesty International which claims Trump is “targeting immigrants,” “attacking freedom of expression and the right to protest,” and “marginalizing Black and other racialized communities.” Logical? Remember when the geniuses in the academy and media lectured us about believing in science? Apparently there’s nothing logical or scientific about not wanting men to compete against women in sports. Legal? Wait, it’s illegal to keep federal monies from entities which do not want to comply with federal desires? Ask states that had drinking ages under 21 how that worked out for them. Authoritarian/fascist regimes? Yes, let’s buy into these budding journalists’ definition of “fascism”; meanwhile, Editor Holmquist (pictured) doesn’t believe downtown Philadelphia is a dangerous place and chides her peers for thinking otherwise (certain demographics, you see). UPenn’s agreement with the Trump administration got it back $175 million. You know what the school’s endowment is worth? Over $22 billion. This means UPenn saved a whopping 0.8 percent of its endowment by conceding to Trump. If it really needs to be pointed out, UPenn can give a middle finger to President Trump by forgoing all federal monies. This is precisely what Hillsdale College does to “maintain its institutional independence.” Twenty-two billion is a helluva lot of money, UPenn. Just throw back that $175 mill (and more), and you’ll be free to not only let Lia Thomas and other men compete against women, but from the shackles of … FASCISM!

    "fullContent": "​​​​​​​\"Enough Is Enough\": Boeing Fighter Jet Workers Begin Strike Update (0635ET): More than 3,200 union members who assemble Boeing's fighter jets across multiple plants in the St. Louis area and Illinois went on strike earlier this morning, after voting on Sunday to reject a modified four-year labor deal with the defense company. This marks the union's first strike since 1996. Workers display picket signs, as they protest during a walkout by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) over contract negotiations, outside Boeing company's facility, in Berkeley, Missouri, U.S., August 4, 2025 REUTERS/Lawrence Bryant \"STRIKE ALERT: 3,200 highly-skilled IAM Union members at Boeing went on strike at midnight because enough is enough,\" the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 837 (IAM District 837) wrote on X around 0200 ET. 🚨 STRIKE ALERT: 3,200 highly-skilled IAM Union members at Boeing went on strike at midnight because enough is enough. This is about respect and dignity, not empty promises. https://t.co/2mRlPkmOMm #UnionStrong — IAM Union (@IAM_Union) August 4, 2025 \"We're disappointed our employees in St. Louis rejected an offer that featured 40% average wage growth,\" Dan Gillian, Boeing vice president and general manager of the St. Louis facilities, told Reuters in a statement. Important to note: IAM District 837 workers assemble Boeing's F-15 and F/A-18 fighters, the T-7 trainer, and the MQ-25. In markets, Boeing shares traded flat in premarket trading in New York. We suspect investors will pay more attention if the strike drags on. The last one in 1996 lasted 99 days. * * * The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 837, representing 3,200 Boeing defense workers across Missouri and Illinois and affiliated with the AFL–CIO/CLC, has rejected a modified four-year labor deal with Boeing. As a result, for the first time since 1996, a strike will begin at midnight, impacting operations at key fighter jet plants. \"IAM District 837 members have spoken loud and clear, they deserve a contract that reflects their skill, dedication, and the critical role they play in our nation's defense,\" IAM District 837 Directing Business Representative Tom Boelling stated in a press release, adding, \"We stand shoulder to shoulder with these working families as they fight for fairness and respect on the job.\" The 3,200 machinists were in a week-long federally mandated \"cooling-off\" period after rejecting Boeing's initial labor contract last Sunday. By Friday, Boeing presented a modified offer that included a 20% pay boost, raising average annual pay from $75,000 to $102,600, along with other perks, including a $5,000 signing bonus. For some context, the last time IAM District 837 went on strike was in 1996, a labor action that lasted 99 days. There's no telling how long the current stoppage will last, but it will undoubtedly impact operations at the F-15, F/A-18, and cutting-edge missile and defense technologies plants. The timing of the strike comes as the world is on fire and deepening into a bipolar state. We asked a very simple question early last week: One must ask whether foreign adversaries, as part of their hybrid warfare campaign to implode the US from within, have exploited this union in an attempt to strike a critical node in America's defense manufacturing hub. Attacking Critical Nodes? US Fighter Jet Factories At Risk Of Labor Strike By Democrat-Aligned Union Indeed, the heads of IAM District 837 were pro-globalist Joe Biden... It's not far-fetched to suggest that foreign adversaries could infiltrate unions; it's a well-documented tactic in the hybrid warfare playbook. Tyler Durden Mon, 08/04/2025 - 06:35",
