Follow us on some of the most beautiful and adventurous hiking trails in Europe’s frontier regions. Become witness of the peaceful growing together of neighbours once divided by the Iron Curtain when we walk along the Borderland Panoramic Trail between Austria and Slovenia. Follow the historic Customs Officers’ path along the entire coastline of Brittany to relive the eponyms’ efforts to prevent smuggling and customs fraud. Or discover the unspoiled nature on the Upper Lusatian Mountain Trail in the borderland between Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic, where wolf packs have found a new home. ------- Chapters ▷ 00:00 - Intro ▷ 01:33 - Hühnerkogel ▷ 04:50 - Jatschkifels ▷ 05:40 - St. Urban ▷ 06:42 - Zweibach Valley ▷ 10:08 - Borderless Radio Communication ▷ 11:58 - St. Pongratzen ▷ 13:50 - ",
