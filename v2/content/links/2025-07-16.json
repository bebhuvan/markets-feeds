    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20465",
    "summary": "As consumer and investor demand for sustainability rises, firms are expanding their portfolios to include more sustainable products. This paper investigates whether such firms, as a result, become more exposed to household income shocks. Using U.S. retail scanner data, we find that declines in household income significantly reduce the share of spending on sustainable products—especially among high-income households. These results are robust to alternative sustainability classifications and cannot be fully explained by health considerations. To help identify causal effects, we exploit exogenous variation in household income arising from the timing of tax rebate disbursements under the 2008 Economic Stimulus Payments program. A structural demand model indicates that the effect is driven by both high-income consumers’ lower price sensitivity and a stronger preference for sustainable products, irrespective of price. Our findings suggest that firms focusing on sustainable offerings may face",

    "title": "DP20464 Dividend Signaling and Bank Payouts in the Great Financial Crisis",
    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20464",
    "summary": "We study the dividend payouts of U.S. banks during the 2008 financial crisis. We show that banks with a higher share of short term liabilities to total liabilities, which were thus more exposed to the 2008 rollover crisis, increased their dividend payouts relative to less exposed banks. This relative increase in dividend payouts is concentrated in relatively cash-rich banks and is not driven by other systematic differences in bank asset portfolios across broad asset classes. The relative dividend payout increase was associated with a short-run increase in stock valuations and a decrease in short-term bond yields, as well as credit default swap premia. We argue that these empirical facts are consistent with a ”dividend signaling channel”, whereby dividend payouts impact the coordination problem and rollover decisions of short-term lenders.",

    "title": "DP20466 Designing and Analyzing Powerful Experiments: Practical Tips for Applied Researchers",
    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20466",
    "summary": "This paper offers practical advice on how to improve statistical power in randomized experiments through choices and actions researchers can take at the design, implementation, and analysis stages. At the design stage, the choice of estimand, choice of treatment, and decisions that affect the residual variance and intra-cluster correlation can all affect power for a given sample size. At the implementation stage, researchers can boost power through increasing compliance with treatment, reducing attrition, and improving outcome measurement. At the analysis stage, power can be increased through using different test statistics or estimands, through the choice of control variables, and through incorporating informative priors in a Bayesian analysis. A key message is that it does not make sense to talk of “the” power of an experiment. A study can be well-powered for one outcome or estimand, but not others, and a fixed sample size can yield very different levels of power depending on researc",

This morning’s report for June was positive, but less so than appeared on the surface.Headline industrial production (blue in the graph below) increased 0.3% for the month. It is higher by 0.7% than it was one year ago, and 0.5% higher than it was in September 2022, its former post-pandemic high. Manufacturing production (red) increased 0.1% and is 1.0% higher than one year ago, but -0.1% lower than its post-pandemic high of October 2022:What’s the difference?

    "summary": "- by New Deal democratMuch of the commentary on yesterday’s CPI report suggested that the tariff impacts were apparent. My own analysis was more cautious. That’s simply because we don’t know for sure which items were affected by tariffs, and at this point referring to, e.g., appliances that showed relatively large monthly increases in prices is speculative - not wrong, mind you, simply speculative. The closest to rigorous analysis I read was that goods inflation was more than services inflation, which would make sense because few “services” can be imported.That issue continued into this morning’s report on June producer prices.Headline PPI was reported this morning to have been unchanged for June, while that for raw commodities increased 0.6%. Still, as shown by the below, the YoY trend in each is hardly that of accelerating inflation. Final demand PPI was up 2.4% YoY, continuing its cooling trend, while that for commodities was up 1.7%, in line with its trend for the past 12 months:Wh",

This paper provides systematic evidence of FDI fragmentation along ideological and geographic lines across five dimensions: shifting away from ideologically distant countries (ideological sorting), prioritizing politically aligned countries (friendshoring), reducing exposure to specific high-risk countries (derisking), moving production closer to the home country (nearshoring), and returning investment to the home country (reshoring). Measures of FDI based on financial transactions reveal evidence of ideological sorting and nearshoring. The capital expenditures of multinational enterprises and their affiliates display ideological sorting, derisking, nearshoring, and reshoring. Cross-border M&A deals reflect patterns of derisking, while horizontal (but not vertical) M&A exhibits broader ideological realignment. At the industry level, derisking and",
