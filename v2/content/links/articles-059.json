    "fullContent": "DOGE Worker \"Big Balls\" Bloodied After DC Attack; Trump, Musk Call To Federalize DC President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have called for the federalization of crime-ridden Washington, D.C., following the brutal attack on 19-year-old Edward Coristine, a former staffer at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) whose LinkedIn handle earned him the nickname 'Big Balls'. \"I have to say that somebody from DOGE was very badly hurt. A young man who was beaten up by a bunch of thugs in D.C., and either they're gonna straighten their act out in the terms of government and in terms of protection, or we're gonna have to federalize and run it the way it's supposed to be run,\" President Trump told reporters Tuesday. The president also posted a lengthy message on Truth Social about the deteriorating crime situation in the nation's capital. He said the city is \"totally out of control,\" adding that kids as young as 14, 15, and 16 are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent citizens. President Trump posted an image of 'Big Balls' sitting on the ground, bloodied after the mob attack. He then declared, \"If this continues, I am going to exert my powers and FEDERALIZE this city.\" Former DOGE employee Marko Elez claimed on X that he snapped the photo of Big Balls after the assault. My friend Big Balls (@as400495) is a hero. I took this photo after Edward protected a young woman from an attempted carjacking by 8 thugs near Dupont Circle. Violence like this in the heart of DC is completely unacceptable. https://t.co/ELShlkXYaS — Marko Elez (@marko_elez) August 5, 2025 Musk also chimed in: \"It is time to federalize DC.\" A few days ago, a gang of about a dozen young men tried to assault a woman in her car at night in DC. A @Doge team member saw what was happening, ran to defend her and was severely beaten to the point of concussion, but he saved her. It is time to federalize DC. pic.twitter.com/RPHKj7J3ti — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 5, 2025 For years, we've informed readers that parts of the nation's capital, and even into Baltimore City, are crime-ridden areas plagued by violent child gangsters. This comes as no surprise, given that far-left Democrats entirely control these metro areas. These far-left leaders are not competent managers, but DEI activists who have done more harm to society than good... D.C. Enforces Youth Curfew \"To Keep Young People Out Of Trouble\" Defund Police Backfires: Democrat Congressman Carjacked At Gunpoint In DC As Crime Chaos Spreads UPS Driver Carjacked In' Grand Theft Auto-Style' Robbery Near DC Citywide Youth Curfew Begins In Baltimore As Mayor Strives To Restore Law And Order It's time to restore safety in America's cities, starting with the nation's capital. For decades, Democrats have masqueraded as competent stewards of these urban areas, but that illusion has collapsed. Their policies have massively failed, and the consequences are undeniable. The time has come for a serious course correction and to restore these crime-ridden cities that rob the youth of a future. Democrats have failed. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 06:11",

    "fullContent": "IDF Chief Clashes With Netanyahu Over Full Permanent Takeover Of Gaza Strip The Israeli military's (IDF) chief of staff, Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir, reportedly sharply disagreed with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a three hour security cabinet meeting Wednesday, where the question of what's next in Gaza was hotly debated. Zamir presented various options, after widespread reports that Netanyahu is ready to pull the trigger on the full conquest and permanent occupation of the Gaza Strip, even if this endangers the remaining living hostages. IDF chief of staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir, via Creative Commons An official statement from Netanyahu's office said the prime minister \"held a closed security consultation that lasted about three hours, during which the Chief of Staff presented various options for continuing the military campaign in Gaza.\" Kan News public broadcaster subsequently stated \"The prime minister's direction is to go and conquer the Gaza Strip.\" However, Zamir is said to have pushed back, saying \"You are entering a trap in Gaza,\" Kan reported. The conquest plan would see IDF ground forces move into new areas where the hostages are believed held, but the army chief of staff argued that this \"will significantly endanger their lives and cause the army to burn out.\" The IDF has been fighting hard for nearly two years, and there have been hundreds of casualties - in the wake of the Hamas/PIJ terror attacks of Oct.7, 2023. Despite likely tens of thousands of Hamas militants having been killed over the course of the war, they have still proven effective in small ambushes against IDF forces, emerging from the tunnels to strike. Netanyahu reportedly shot back during the meeting that \"until now, the IDF's modus operandi has not led to a deal for hostages and their release, therefore, a different action is required. Hamas will understand that it has no immunity and will reach a deal.\" Reports say that Zamir is opting for a strategy of encirclement and targeted raids, largely in continuation of what's happening now, in order to continue grinding down and exhausting the remaining Hamas fighters. Zamir is reportedly ready to carry out whatever the cabinet ultimately decides, and a follow-up Thursday cabinet meeting will feature a vote. Tyler Durden Thu, 08/07/2025 - 05:45",
