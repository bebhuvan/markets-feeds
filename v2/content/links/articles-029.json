    "summary": "Globalization offers unparalleled opportunities to expand welfare through cooperation across large networks of unrelated individuals. Social exclusion – permanent or temporary – and monetary exchange are institutions that in theory can incentivize cooperation. In an experiment, we evaluate their relative performance and interaction in anonymous networks of different sizes. Permanent social exclusion (ostracism) reduces long-run economic potential by leading to sparse networks. Monetary exchange and temporary social exclusion perform similarly well in small networks. In large networks, however, monetary exchange is the only institution that promotes full cooperation by crowding out ostracism and keeping the network complete. An insight is that monetary systems outperform social exclusion mechanisms in promoting cooperation in globalized social and economic networks.",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20485",
    "summary": "The majority of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China were privatized through ownership reforms over the last three decades. Using a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enterprises in China between 1998 and 2013, we show that privatized SOEs continue to benefit from government support relative to private enterprises. Compared to private firms that were never state-owned, privatized SOEs are favored by lower interest loans and higher government subsidies. Moreover, both SOEs and privatized SOEs significantly underperform relative to private firms, despite some improvements post-privatization. An exception is in improvements in productivity growth, where former SOEs match or exceed their private sector counterparts–results consistent with recent research. We also implement staggered difference-in-differences and matching estimation to account for treatment over multiple periods and selection into privatization. The tiger can change its stripes; however, former SOEs face a mor",

We first prove that the space of Markovian randomized stopping times can be topologized as a compact absolute retract. This in turn enables us to use a powerful fixed-point theorem by Eilenberg and Montgomery to prove our existence theorem. We illustrate our results with an example of a war of attrition that admits a mixed-strategy Markov-perfect equilibrium but no pure-strategy Markov-perfect equilibrium.",

    "summary": "Students may hold stereotyped beliefs about subjects that distort subject choices. For example, economics is believed to be about money, not inequality or well-being, and this perception may attract some students to the subject, while deterring others. We report results from a UK-wide high school outreach program in which undergraduate champions delivered economics taster sessions to 5,000+ students. The sessions increase students’ reported likelihood of studying economics by ~20 per cent. We shed light on what drives this increase. The sessions broaden students’ understanding of what economics is about and this accounts for ~20 per cent of the increased likelihood. The sessions also change students’ beliefs about (different attributes of) studying economics. The most important drivers of the increased likelihood are students’ increased beliefs that they will do well in economics and that they will enjoy studying the subject.",

    "summary": "Administrative barriers to trade such as customs procedures are well-documented sources of delays and costs in cross-border commerce, often prompting firms to outsource these tasks to specialist customs agents. This paper examines the role of customs agents in a key global trade facilitation policy—the Authorized Economic Operator Mutual Recognition Agreement (AEO-MRA)—which enables certified traders to benefit from simplified customs procedures with partner countries. Focusing on the 2012 EU-US AEO-MRA, and using UK transaction-level customs data from HMRC that uniquely identify the AEO status of agents filing on behalf of firms, we document the widespread use of customs agents in UK exports. Guided by a theoretical framework, we show that non-certified firms benefited indirectly from the policy through certified agents, leading to more US market entry, fewer product exits, and higher export values. These findings highlight the role of intermediaries in extending the reach of trade fa",

    "summary": "Using a large and representative panel of U.S. brokerage accounts, we show that retail investors trade as contrarians after large earnings surprises, especially for loser stocks, and that such contrarian trading contributes to price momentum and post earnings announcement drift (PEAD). We show that extreme return streaks and surprises are not enough for stocks to exhibit PEAD and momentum and that the intensity of contrarian retail trading plays a key role: the PEAD of loser stocks with bad earnings surprises becomes increasingly more negative as retail buying pressure increases, and he PEAD of the stocks with the highest past returns and largest earnings surprises is the most positive for the stocks with the biggest net retail outflow. Finer sorts confirm the results, as do sorts by firm size and institutional ownership level. Younger and more attentive individuals are more likely to be contrarian, and a firm’s dividend yield, leverage, size, book to market, and analyst coverage are a",

Since I haven’t updated the impact of Tariff-palooza! on transport and spending in awhile, let’s take a look at that.The “tip of the spear” is container shipping. Here’s a graph of traffic at the busiest ports in the US, from CNBC:At the busiest ports, the steep decline this spring after a period of front-running is evident. In the past few weeks, there has been a rebound, doubtless in part caused by the TACO delay in tariff implementation. With the current “Liberation Day 2.0” set for August 1, a similar dynamic may well be in play.Once containers arrive in the US, they are typically shipped long distances by rail. Here is the historical record of monthly intermodal volumes through June, measured YoY to deal with seasonality:Again, the slowdown this spring is apparent.Here is a weekly close-up of the past year:Much like shipping traffic, there has been a rebound so far in July, which may very well represent front-running th",

First, trend-following has not performed well across all major asset classes; however, an equity cross-sectional momentum approach did very well. The directional changes associated with the high uncertainty in 20205 have hurt those following trends. Trend-following is a pure directional strategy, while a momentum strategy focuses on relative movement to create a long/short portfolio.Over the longer term, equity momentum continues to perform well, but there were also substantial gains focused on short-term interest rates. Clearly, there are no exploitable trends in all assets, and the secret to good trend-following is to balance exposures across all asset classes.",

This is the big idea behind The Wealth Ladder: Proven Strategies for Every Step of Your Financial Life, which is officially out today! You can find it on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kindle, Audible (narrated by me), and everywhere else books are sold: Instead of providing a singular solution to your money problems, The Wealth Ladder provides the right strategy based on your financial starting point and desired destination.

    "summary": "This paper studies how firms’ ownership choices and workers’ intrinsic motivation jointly shape service quality and market outcomes in labor-intensive, mission-driven sectors. Two organizations first choose whether to operate as standard for-profit or as mission-oriented firms, and then compete in both the labor and the user markets. Mission-oriented firms have higher unit costs but attract better-motivated workers. Service quality is endogenously determined through the sorting of intrinsically motivated workers and depends on the firm's ownership type. We show that all market structures — standard, mission-oriented, or mixed — can arise in equilibrium, and that mixed structures can be Pareto superior by efficiently allocating the most motivated workers to the mission-oriented firm while preserving the cost advantage of the other firm. While equilibrium outcomes generally diverge from the social optimum due to externalities and lack of coordination, they are both driven by the trade-of",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20479",
    "summary": "This paper explores a repositioning of Europe’s labor market institutions as potential drivers of the transatlantic gap in macroeconomic performance. Institutional diagnoses were prominent in times of high European unemployment in the 1980-90s. But interest waned as joblessness fell—even though the decline was uneven, precarious work arrangements have grown, and labor markets remain largely unreformed (unlike product and financial markets). Yet, rigid labor market institutions might continue to matter because they can stifle labor market and business dynamism: Europeans switch jobs much less frequently, and restructuring is much rarer. Recent research argues that such immobility impedes wage and productivity growth. Moreover, this low dynamism might contribute to Europe’s specific underperformance in tech, R&D, disruptive innovation, ICT adoption—where creative destruction requires fluid reallocation. This institutional labor market perspective on European competitiveness complements p",

    "summary": "We present new evidence on the impact of fiscal variables on long-term interest rates and term premia in the United States. To alleviate endogeneity problems, we follow the seminal methodology by Laubach (2009) and resort to long-term projections of interest rates and fiscal variables. After incorporating an additional 20 years of data into our sample, the estimated effects of debt and deficits on interest rates show little change from Laubach’s findings. However, we show that the link between long-term rates and fiscal variables is not stable over time. It was close to zero during the years of relative fiscal prudence around the turn of the century and it has been increasing since fiscal positions have started to deteriorate markedly",

    "url": "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20477",
    "summary": "This paper presents micro-empirical evidence on the effects of wage-setting decentralization. Our setting is Italy, where employers are required to comply with occupation- and industry-specific wage floors set by national collective bargaining agreements. We show that opting out of these agreements reduces wages but increases workers’ employment and retention within firms. These effects are most pronounced in the more productive North, where the overall impact on workers’ earnings is slightly positive. In contrast, in the South, wage losses outweigh employment gains, leading to a net decline in earnings. We also find that increased wage-setting flexibility is associated with higher firm survival rates in both regions. The regional divergence in outcomes aligns with a monopsony framework in which productivity and labor supply elasticities vary spatially.",
