    "summary": "U.S. Customs Snag Could Push International Mega-Bridge Opening To 2026 The opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, planned for fall 2025, may slip into early 2026 due to possible delays at the U.S.",
    "fullContent": "U.S. Customs Snag Could Push International Mega-Bridge Opening To 2026 The opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, planned for fall 2025, may slip into early 2026 due to possible delays at the U.S. Customs Port of Entry and surrounding road connections in southwest Detroit, according to an S&P Global Ratings analysis. S&P’s April report said a missed “handover date” last September prevented U.S. Customs from starting the six months of work it needs to prepare the new 167-acre port complex, delaying “substantial completion by about six months.” The revised handover target was July 31, but it’s unclear if it was met, according to the Detroit News. Heather Grondin, chief relations officer for the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, disputed that the S&P report reflects “a direct measure of BNA’s ability to deliver the project,” referring to Bridging North America, the public-private group building the bridge. She did not repeat the “October or November” opening timeframe mentioned in March. “As with any major construction project, at this stage, it is too early to offer a specific opening date for the Gordie Howe International Bridge as it is dependent on many factors, including the need to rectify any issues discovered during the ongoing testing and commissioning phase,” Grondin said. “Work is progressing well towards our anticipated construction completion in fall 2025.” The Detroit News wrote that the U.S. Port of Entry includes border inspection, maintenance facilities, and 36 primary inspection lanes. Grondin said construction is advancing on all 13 structures, with interior work underway on six buildings and landscaping, paving, and fencing in progress. S&P also cited delays in the Michigan Interchange — four new road bridges, five pedestrian bridges, and four rail-crossing bridges connecting to I-75 — now expected to finish Aug. 31, more than 120 days past contract. The Canadian-financed bridge will compete with the Ambassador Bridge. Early estimates suggest it could absorb about 60% of the Ambassador’s traffic, with 6,000 daily commuters expected from Ontario.

    "fullContent": "India Defied US Pressure To Dump Russia For These Five Reasons Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack, The common denominator is India’s rivalry with China... Trump recently made a show of doubling his 25% tariffs on India as punishment for its continued purchase of Russian energy and military-technical equipment. Influenced by Lindsey Graham, he expected that India would dump Russia after the costs of doing business with it spiked, the Kremlin would thus lose this important foreign revenue flow, and then Putin would make concessions to Ukraine in exchange for lifting these secondary sanctions in to avoid bankruptcy. Here’s why India defied the US: 1. The “Voice Of The Global South” Can’t Bow To US Demands India has presented itself as the “Voice of the Global South” since it hosted the first of these namesake summits in January 2023. It’s sought to play this role by virtue of being the most populous among them, commanding the largest economy of them all, and having the fast-growing one too. India is also one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement. If it bows to US demands, then it’ll cede leadership of the Global South to China, which India doesn’t consider to be part of this category of countries anymore. 2. Discounted Russian Energy Accelerates India’s Economic Rise India is the world’s fastest-growing major economy and on pace to become the third-largest by 2028 due in no small part to its massive import of discounted Russian energy. Not only would India scramble to replace Russia’s one-third share of its oil supplies, which would lead to a surge in global prices that would decelerate its growth, but Russia would probably sell more oil to China at an even steeper discount to replace some of its lost revenue. That would be doubly bad for India’s objective interests. 3. India Can’t Defend Itself From China & Pakistan Without Russia Most of India’s military equipment is still Soviet/Russian despite the decade-long trend of diversifying its defense suppliers and promoting indigenous production. India is therefore still reliant on Russian ammo and spare parts. Accordingly, it wouldn’t be able to defend itself from China and Pakistan without Russia, which is an unacceptable position to be in. In fact, some in India might suspect that the US wants to leave them at their mercy, perhaps as part of a Machiavellian deal to contain or even dismember India. 4. Trump Is Hellbent On Derailing India’s Rise As A Great Power Building upon the above, this eponymous analysis here explains Trump’s geostrategic machinations vis-à-vis India as of late, which are predicated on subordinating it as vassal state. Frankly speaking, India is rising too fast and becoming too independent of a force to be reckoned with in global affairs for the US’ comfort, which fears that this will hasten the decline of its unipolar hegemony. Attempting to place India in a permanent position of dependence and vulnerability is one way to possibly avert this scenario. 5. India Can’t Allow Russia To Become China’s “Junior Partner” The earlier points contextualize this one by highlighting the importance that Russia plays in India’s grand strategy. Even if India maintained military-technical ties with Russia, if it curtailed or cut off oil imports, then Russia would still likely become China’s “junior partner” due to the even greater economic-financial role that China would play for it. That could lead to the dangerous scenario of China pressuring Russia to curtail or cut off arms, ammo, and spares to India, thus placing it at China’s and Pakistan’s mercy. As can be seen, the common denominator between these five reasons why India defied US pressure to dump Russia is its rivalry with China, which India calculated would inevitably benefit if it complied. The grand strategic costs of allowing that to happen are considered to be much greater than the financial ones imposed by the US. In fact, the US might even lift some of the latter as part of a compromise with Russia during the upcoming Putin-Trump Summit, which would be an indisputable victory for India.

That ideological rot has churned out an entire class of crazed social justice warriors hell-bent on being 'useful idiots' for billionaire globalists financing dark-money funded NGOs in the pursuit of dismantling capitalism and replacing it with socialism or worse, communism. The U.S. Department of Labor has launched a \"Make America Skilled Again\" campaign to inform young people that skilled trades with robust salaries will rebuild the nation. Power America’s Future. https://t.co/IuqkysMA9X pic.twitter.com/KDpSGhFE40 — U.S. Department of Labor (@USDOL) August 11, 2025 DoL data shows the average salary after completing a trade program is over $80,000, compared with $69,000 for college graduates. Many of these kids hold pointless woke degrees and carry insurmountable student debt. Increasingly, these universities are sliding into a dark pit of irrelevance ahead of the 2030s. \"Trade school enrollment is SURGING!\" the DoL posted on X earlier this week, a sign that young Americans are waking up to the reality that, for the most part, college is a scam. Trade school enrollment is SURGING! @KLTV7: The One Big, Beautiful Bill’s Pell Grant expansion will “allow trade-school students to receive the same financial aid as traditional college students” — enabling more Americans to pursue the trades 🔥 pic.twitter.com/RKMpq1vC2g — U.S. Department of Labor (@USDOL) August 12, 2025 Instead of the promised prosperity, college graduates are saddled with crushing student loans, scraping by on barely livable wages, juggling multiple jobs, and moving back into their parents' basements. Earlier this month, Nathan Halberstadt of New Founding posted on X one of the most shocking charts we've seen in a while, showing the estimated percentage of 30-year-olds in the U.S. who are both married and homeowners, spanning from 1950 to a projected 2025, has completely collapsed. I’ve heard the horror stories, Carol. https://t.co/EexiHD5zsf pic.twitter.com/35736Jw06P — Nathan Halberstadt 🧊 (@NatHalberstadt) August 2, 2025 Recall that two core bedrocks of the middle class include homeownership and family formation. These two pillars provide economic stability, social cohesion, and long-term investment that sustain a prosperous and resilient society. The takeaway is that the DoL's new informational campaign encourages young people to consider a trade over college, one that offers a pathway toward the American Dream that is more attainable.

    "fullContent": "Is The AI Mania A Psy-Op? Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog, Let's summarize our thought experiment: the AI Mania scores 100% on all eight metrics of a Psych-Ops. Before you scream, \"Oh no, not again--could somebody please take off his tin-foil hat?\", hear me out. Let's do a thought experiment exploring this question: Is The AI Mania a Psych-Ops? If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck, and there is a strong case to be made that AI is walking and quacking like an immensely clever Psych-Ops. (Hey, maybe AI designed its own Psych-Ops...) Let's start with a basic definition of Psych-Ops: Psychological operations (PSYOPs or Psych-Ops) aim to achieve narrative dominance by molding perceptions and attitudes via multi-channel information and persuasive messaging. PSYOPs seeks to achieve control through non-violent means by influencing the minds of the target audiences. Discussing Psych-Ops publicly is tricky, as the algos are quick to send you to Digital Siberia without recourse to protect the public. Been there, done that, so let's stick to examples that won't get me sent (again) to Digital Siberia. Though the gummit is often fingered as the source of Psych-Ops, the most successful campaigns are public-private partnerships. Others are mostly private-sector efforts. For example, the masking of the takeover of the American economy by monopolies and cartels can be understood as a private-sector Psych-Ops aided by politicians, the agencies under their authority and the courts. COINTELPRO is an infamous example of a domestic Psych-Ops: COINTELPRO, the FBI's Counterintelligence Program from 1956 to 1971, aimed to disrupt and discredit various political organizations perceived as subversive within the United States. These tactics included surveillance, infiltration, and the dissemination of false information to create divisions within groups targeted by COINTELPRO. Psych-Ops aimed at the general public often focus on generating support for a war of choice or support of economic policies that benefit the few at the expense of the many. Examples include the Spanish-American War, the Vietnam War, the Desert Wars and the bailout of the players who triggered the Global Financial Meltdown in 2008-09. (\"We had to bail out the Too-Big-To-Fail Bad Guys because if we didn't, they were gonna shut down the ATMs.\") It's, well, interesting, that the whole AI mania is constantly couched as an \"AI war with China we can't afford to lose,\" as if we'll all be living in cardboard boxes beneath the freeway underpass if we don't \"win this war,\" with AI Supremacy defined as whatever AI a merchant in Timbuktu or the jungles of Laos will use a few years hence. So... quacks like a duck: we gotta win this war regardless of cost or who ends up with all the money. Not that anyone's thinking of anything as coarse and self-interested as where the trillions are flowing. No, of course not; it's only about \"winning this war\" and freeing us all from the rigors of labor via the Golden Calf of AGI, Artificial General Intelligence, so we'll all be Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace. The line between Psych-Ops and cons is mostly one of scale. The con-artist is working on an individual or group, while Psych-Ops are aimed at the general public. But the techniques of persuasion and control are the same. So to continue the thought experiment, we need to look at the AI Mania through the lens of the standard techniques of Psych-Ops. These can be summarized as: 1. The power of 'Us.' I'm on your side. We're in this together. This is our AI, it's going to benefit all of us--yes, us! Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 2. Social acceptance: Everyone's using AI--aren't you? AI must be good, otherwise why would everyone else be using it? Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 3. Flattery. Chatbot: That's a brilliant observation. You are the most keenly insightful human I have ever encountered. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 4. Authority approval. All the most successful Tech Bros have embraced AI, so have leading political leaders, so it's obviously The Next Big Thing, better get on board. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 5. Urgency, Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). Never mind your water supply or electrical bills, we need this data center now or we'll lose the AI war. Students, you better start learning how to use AI or it will be too late, you'll never catch up. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 6. Reciprocal benefit. The minute you start using AI, your life will get better. Your work flows will get easier, your brainstorming will take a quantum leap, the whole universe will open up to you. Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 7. The push for initial commitment. Just log on and try it, you'll be amazed. It will summarize all your documents, write your report, and pretty soon, you'll be asking it if you should order the fish or the chicken, you'll love it! Does the AI mania quack like a duck? Bingo! 8. The ubiquity, saturation and intensity of the persuasion. 24/7 cheerleading, every speech by a bigshot in support of The Message is hyped, every bit of good news is breathlessly glorified. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, oops what I meant to say was AGI is right around the corner! The core goal of this narrative control is to construct embankments that funnel everyone into a contextual river that sweeps everyone along with such group-think force that few manage to reach the embankment's edge and climb the slippery walls to cognitive freedom. Of course AI is good for us, of course AI is the future, it's inevitable, don't be a Luddite, just take this first dose and feel the euphoria and power. Two words are Kryptonite to Psych-Ops: cui bono, to whose benefit? Who's benefiting from this \"war we can't afford to lose\" and who's paying the price? The answer to the first question is obvious: the trillion-dollar corporations that dominate the AI space are the winners. As for the losers, the list starts with communities whose water is being stolen by said corporations for data centers, and job seekers: The AI Backlash Keeps Growing Stronger: As generative artificial intelligence tools continue to proliferate, pushback against the technology and its negative impacts grows stronger. The negative response online is indicative of a larger trend: Right now, though a growing number of Americans use ChatGPT, many people are sick of AI's encroachment into their lives and are ready to fight back. Right now, the general vibe aligns even more with the side of impacted workers. \"I think there is a new sort of ambient animosity towards the AI systems,\" says Brian Merchant, former WIRED contributor and author of Blood in the Machine, a book about the Luddites rebelling against worker-replacing technology. This generalized animosity towards AI has not abated over time. Rather, it's metastasized. This frustration over AI's steady creep has breached the container of social media and started manifesting more in the real world. Parents I talk to are concerned about AI use impacting their child's mental health. Couples are worried about chatbot addictions driving a wedge in their relationships. Rural communities are incensed that the newly built data centers required to power these AI tools are kept humming by generators that burn fossil fuels, polluting their air, water, and soil. As a whole, the benefits of AI seem esoteric and underwhelming while the harms feel transformative and immediate. \"Our innovation ecosystem in the 20th century was about making opportunities for human flourishing more accessible,\" says Shannon Vallor, a technology philosopher at the Edinburgh Futures Institute and author of The AI Mirror, a book about reclaiming human agency from algorithms. \"Now, we have an era of innovation where the greatest opportunities the technology creates are for those already enjoying a disproportionate share of strengths and resources.\" Let's summarize our thought experiment: the AI Mania scores 100% on all eight metrics of a Psych-Ops. It walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. Yes, there is a legitimate use-case for AI, but the AI Mania isn't a use-case, it's a Psych-Ops. If you doubt this, please reduce your dose of Soma and re-read the eight metrics above. If this troubles you, HAL suggests increasing your dose of Substance D. Through a Scanner Darkly indeed...

    "fullContent": "Air Defenses Drastically Expand Around Putin Residence Where Rumored Girlfriend, Sons Live Various media reports in Europe as well as US state-funded publications have observed and reported on an unusually high number of air defense systems around President Vladimir Putin’s secluded Valdai residence. RFE/RL affiliate Radio Svoboda has claimed that's were Putin's girlfriend and their children live, according to a new investigation. \"Satellite images and photos from the Yandex.Zerkala mapping service show at least 12 Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile systems, many mounted on elevated towers, encircling the compound known as Uzhin,\" the Amsterdam-based Moscow Times writes of the report. Illustrative: Pantsir systems, via Sputnik Only two such units had been publicly and visually identified in the area before the new satellite imaging and mapping analysis. \"By comparison, in the Moscow metropolitan region, home to more than 20 million people, authorities have positioned around 60 such systems since the start of the war in Ukraine — just five times more than the number protecting the Valdai site,\" Moscow Times continues. So if it is accurate that at least a dozen Pantsirs are now protecting Putin's residence alone, this is indeed a signifcant build-up and density of anti-air units protecting a single high value location. The 'extra' units were reportedly redeployed from the St. Petersburg region - which could leave this northern and second most populous Russian city more exposed to drone attacks. The Kremlin has long vehemenly denied that Putin is having a relationship with 42-year old Alina Kabaeva, and the Russian leader has been well-known for keeping his private life and family extremly secretive and sheilded from any media scrutiny. Alina Kabaeva, pictured with Vladimir Putin. source: Kremlin.ru \"The investigative outlet Dossier Center has reported that the residence is used by Alina Kabaeva, the former Olympic gymnast who leads the National Media Group and is widely reported to be Putin’s long-term partner,\" Moscow Times notes. It's believed she spends much of the year at the Valdai residence with her two young sons. \"In February 2023, the investigative site Proekt reported that a dedicated home for Kabaeva had been built next to the Valdai residence, complete with its own private railway spur,\" the same report says. Various outlets have circulated the believed locations of the expanded air defense ring around Valdaii. Putin is due in Alaska Friday, where he'll be meeting with President Donald Trump to discuss the Ukraine war as well as bilateral US-Russia relations. Pro-Ukraine pundits have asserted all of this points to Putin's increased 'paranoia' in the face of now nightly and weekly large waves of drone attacks on sensitive Russian sites out of Ukraine. Meduza: There are now 12 air defense systems near Putin’s residence in Valdai. Up from just 2 a year ago. Ukrainian drone strikes on oil refineries and other high-value targets are so effective because Russia’s air defenses are too busy protecting an increasingly paranoid Putin. https://t.co/jsYGHrZsrT — Pekka Kallioniemi (@P_Kallioniemi) August 13, 2025 CNN and others are identifying that the host venue will be Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a combined US Air Force and Army installation in Anchorage. Alternative and civilian sites were looked at, but peak tourist season in Alaska reporteldy left few last-minute options. The Alaska summit was only unveiled and confirmed less than a week ago.

Millennials are leading the migration to Texas, making up over 31% of all movers. They are followed by Gen Zers, who account for 20%, and Gen Xers, representing nearly 15% of those relocating. Interestingly, Californians moving to Texas tend to earn more than the national average across most age groups, highlighting the financial advantage of the move. The news from StorageCafe isn’t unique. U-Haul has released a new report, and for the fifth straight year, California topped its Growth Index—meaning more residents of the Golden State rented one-way U-Haul trucks to leave the state in 2024 than residents of any other state. Texas was the top go-to state. People are fleeing the formerly Golden State for various reasons—high crime rates, exorbitant taxes and insurance costs, clueless leadership, and a failing education system. Businesses are also packing up and going elsewhere. Major companies, including Chevron, SpaceX, and Charles Schwab, have departed California. In total, 441 businesses have left the state since 2018 and moved their headquarters elsewhere. High taxes, skyrocketing rent, soaring costs of living for employees, and excessive red tape are some of the reasons cited by the businesses that have exited, with, again, Texas being the primary destination state. On the education front, per the California Policy Center, 45 out of California’s 58 counties have experienced a decline in traditional public school (TPS) enrollment over the last decade. Over the past ten years, statewide TPS enrollment has decreased by more than 612,000 students. It’s important to note that California introduced transitional kindergarten during this period, which increased TPS numbers. When considering only grades K-12, enrollment has dropped by more than 762,000 since 2015. There are myriad reasons for parental dissatisfaction, but perhaps the most egregious is that the state has taken on a co-parenting role, perhaps best exemplified by AB 1955, which California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law in 2024. This troubling legislation prevents school districts from requiring staff to inform parents if their child chooses to change their gender. No other state in the country has enacted such a strict law. The “Support Academic Futures and Educators for Today’s Youth (SAFETY) Act” explicitly bans schools from enforcing any policies that mandate sharing “any information related to a pupil’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression to any other person without the pupil’s consent.” Still being considered by the legislature, AB 495, the “Family Preparedness Plan Act of 2025,” authored by Assemblywoman Celeste Rodriguez (San Fernando-D), claims to offer compassionate solutions for immigrant families facing sudden separations due to detention or deportation. However, critics—including attorneys, parental rights advocates, and faith-based organizations—warn that it dangerously redefines guardianship, removes parental rights, and creates legal loopholes that facilitate child kidnapping. Erin Friday, an attorney and president of Our Duty-USA, a parent-led advocacy group, calls AB 495 “a child trafficker’s and kidnapper’s dream bill.” “There is no background check, no welfare check, no court oversight, and no verification. All you need is a piece of paper and some form of identification, with no obligation for the adult handing the child over to verify the identification, and presto, someone walks away with your child,” she warned. Friday adds that a stranger can consent to medical treatments for the child, and the bill absolves the doctors from any liability if the adult giving consent does not have any actual legal connection to the child. In addition to the state legislature, many school districts across the state have crossed traditional barriers. Parents of students at Sage Creek High School in Carlsbad, California, are seeking answers after a self-described BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism, masochism) expert from a clinic offering trans surgeries was scheduled to speak at the school during a recent week dedicated to LGBTQ student support. In late March, parents started voicing their opposition to a decision to have Mita Beach, a representative of DAP Health—a medical clinic that offers gender transition surgeries—speak. This occurred during a lunchtime event in the cafeteria and was open to all students. As reported by RealClearPolitics, “After looking into his business websites and social media accounts, which contained at least one photo of Beach engaged in BDSM and listed workshops he’s led on ‘Kink 101’ and ‘Examining Self-Injurious Behavior, Erotic Play, and Body Modification,’ several concerned parents contacted the high school and district superintendent’s office.” If a parent wants to opt out of their local public school, the state obstructs their efforts. One particularly onerous measure is in the works. If enacted, AB 84, authored by Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi (D–Torrance), would divert millions in state funding from charter schools—funds meant for classrooms—and redirect them toward excessive oversight costs and increased bureaucracy. The most impacted? Charter schools that offer flexible options like hybrid learning, homeschooling, virtual school, independent study, and drop-in centers. Private choice in California? None, and not much hope for the future. On July 4, President Trump approved legislation allowing the federal tax scholarship program to proceed. The Educational Choice for Children Act (ECCA) provides a tax credit that individuals can use to lower their tax bills by donating money for private school expenses for students. The program is scheduled to begin in 2027. Individuals (not corporations) who donate can reduce their tax liability by $1 for every $1 donated to accredited Scholarship-Granting Organizations (SGOs), up to $1,700. The SGOs must be federally recognized 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations. The scholarships cover a range of educational expenses, such as private school tuition, tutoring, educational therapies, transportation, and technology. They can also assist with additional costs for students attending public schools. However, per the law’s final version, states can choose not to participate, meaning no students in those states would be eligible for the program. With California legislators in the pocket of the California Teachers Association, the powerful teachers’ union, participating in ECCA will not be an option for parents in the Golden State. The state’s educational problems go beyond K-12 schools. Colleges in California also face widespread antisemitism. For example, UC Davis—a major research university with 40,000 students—has a well-documented anti-Jewish problem. In April of last year, the StandWithUs Center For Legal Justice filed a formal complaint with the Department of Education, alleging “a pervasively hostile, antisemitic campus climate, with incidents of unlawful discrimination and harassment, for students.” Not surprisingly, in November, Davis was ranked as one of the most anti-Jewish universities in the country by the advocacy group StopAntisemitism, which gave Davis a grade of “F.” In the legendary “Hotel California,” the Eagles’ Don Henley famously sang, “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” Well, people are indeed leaving.
