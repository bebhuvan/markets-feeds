Or are there actual ways to increase your earnings without needing to increase your effort? The truth is somewhere in between. Yes, it's possible to increase your income without increasing your effort, but only if you change your strategy. This is the premise of my upcoming book, The Wealth Ladder, which comes out in 2 weeks. The core idea: the strategy that got you to one point in your financial life may not get you to the next. This is true whether you're trying to build wealth or simply earn more. Too often we get stuck in the same routines while expecting different results. But, when it comes to making more without working more, the answer isn't necessarily to work harder, but to work differently.

The new orders subindex came in at 46.4, and its three month average was 47.1. On Thursday the non-manufacturing index was reported at 54.2, and the new orders index at 51.3.
