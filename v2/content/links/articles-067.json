None of the weaknesses addressed this month are known to be actively exploited, but 14 of the flaws earned Microsoft’s most-dire “critical” rating, meaning they could be exploited to seize control over vulnerable Windows PCs with little or no help from users.

    "summary": "- by New Deal democratThis is Ben Casellman, Chief Economic Correspondent for The NY Times’s take on last Friday’s employment report:I beg to differ. As I wrote Friday, underneath the headlines, this was a barely positive report - with some significant negatives. Let me point out a couple of the big ones today.The headline was 147,000 jobs added, about average for the past year:So it’s all good, right? Not so fast.That 147,000 breaks down to 74,000 private jobs + 63,000 education (and 10,000 other). In the past six years, only 3 other times have public sector jobs (including education and all other government jobs) been such a large component of the total gain:And the simple reason is that education employment is highly seasonal, with layoffs in May through July, and rehiring in August through October, as shown in the below graph where the non-seasonally adjusted numbers are in light blue, the seasonally adjusted ones in dark blue - and even then, I’ve had to divide the NSA numbers by ",

    "summary": "Beta is time-varying. There is no dispute about this. The traditional approach to addressing this problem is to utilize a rolling window to adjust beta over time; however, this method does not account for the changing environment. It just increases the use of new information.A new paper, \"Conditional Betas: A Non-Standard Approach,\" attempts to find a new method to account for changing beta. It compares the quality of beta forecasts with one of the leading alternatives of windsorizing the data for beta. The overall effect of a simple machine learning approach is very positive. Results are strong and only based on past price data. This is worth further exploration. I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to see a hedge balanced trade fall apart because the beta estimate is wrong. Market neutral is no longer market neutral. This may not seem like a significant issue for long-only managers, but for a long/short portfolio, it is a substantial problem.",

    "summary": "One of the topics that has received attention in microfinance research is the discussion of what constitutes a safe asset and whether it is in short supply. During a crisis, there is an increased demand for safe assets that are information-insensitive and serve as a means to protect wealth. A simple example of a safe asset is the US Treasury bill. When there is high uncertainty, investors tend to sell risky assets and shift to safer ones. However, if there is a shortage of these safe assets, the price will be bid up, placing downward pressure on interest rates. Nevertheless, there is the assumption that the supposed safe asset will really be safe. That is, the risk or market uncertainty cannot come from the producer of the safe asset. If there is an increase in risk from the safe asset, it will lose its convenience yield, and it will no longer be uncorrelated with risky assets. In this case, there will be a demand for alternative safe assets. One alternative is gold. Gold is often unco",

    "summary": "Sinem Hacioglu-Hoke, Leo Feler, and Jack ChylakUsing zip-code median income as a proxy for household income is common in economics but can mask heterogeneity and yield misleading conclusions. Using zip-code median income and self-reported household incomes from a representative panel of 150,000 U.S. households, we decompose average retail spending for 2018-2024. When using self-reported incomes, we observe substantial divergence in spending between low- and high-income households starting in mid-2021. When using zip-code aggregates as a proxy, this divergence disappears. Our findings indicate a 35 to 75 percent discrepancy between zip-code aggregates and self-reported incomes, highlighting the limitation of zip-code aggregates as a proxy for household incomes.",

The analysis reveals several key findings that enhance the understanding of the off-the-run Treasury market liquidity. First, the indicative bid-ask spread is shown to be a biased measure of liquidity, even when not considering transaction volume. Specifically, bid-ask spreads systematically overstate trading costs of more seasoned Treasuries, and the liquidity of benchmark, on-the-run securities affects how off-the-run bid-ask spreads map to trading costs. Second, the paper demonstrates that trading costs may scale non-monotonically with transaction volume, which suggests selective, opportunistic liquidity-taking. Additionally, transaction size has greater effect on off-the-run securities’ trading costs when benchmark, on-the-run liquidity is lower. Finally, indicative bid-ask spreads may notably overstate trading costs for larger",

GrishchenkoWe apply natural language processing tools to news articles in the financial press to construct a sentiment index—an index of the perceived semantic orientation of monetary policy communications around scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. To that end, we develop several dictionaries that capture various monetary policy tools: conventional monetary policy, asset purchases, and forward guidance. The surprises in the sentiment index around FOMC meetings announcements explain variation in major asset prices classes between May 1999 and November 2022. Sentiment index surprises are important for explaining the variation in asset prices beyond monetary policy surprises.",

    "summary": "Eric EngstromAmid ongoing trade policy shifts and geopolitical uncertainty, concerns about stagflation have reemerged as a key macroeconomic risk. This paper develops a probabilistic framework to estimate the likelihood of stagflation versus soft landing scenarios over a four-quarter horizon. Building on Bekaert, Engstrom, and Ermolov (2025), the model integrates survey forecasts, structural shock decomposition, and a non-Gaussian BEGE-GARCH approach to capture time-varying volatility and skewness. Results suggest that the probability of stagflation was elevated at around 30 percent in late 2022, while the chance of a soft landing was below 5 percent. As inflation moderated and growth remained strong through 2024, these probabilities reversed. However, by mid-2025, renewed tariff concerns drove stagflation risk back up and the probability of a soft landing lower. These shifts highlight the potential value of distributional forecasting for policymakers and market participants navigating",

    "summary": "Making more without working more. It's the holy grail of personal finance. But is it as difficult to achieve as it seems? Or are there actual ways to increase your earnings without needing to increase your effort? The truth is somewhere in between. Yes, it's possible to increase your income without increasing your effort, but only if you change your strategy. This is the premise of my upcoming book, The Wealth Ladder, which comes out in 2 weeks. The core idea: the strategy that got you to one point in your financial life may not get you to the next. This is true whether you're trying to build wealth or simply earn more. Too often we get stuck in the same routines while expecting different results. But, when it comes to making more without working more, the answer isn't necessarily to work harder, but to work differently. Below are four strategies I explore in more depth in the book that can help raise your income over time. Let's dig in. Negotiate a Raise The simplest way to get paid m",

The new orders subindex came in at 46.4, and its three month average was 47.1. On Thursday the non-manufacturing index was reported at 54.2, and the new orders index at 51.3. The three month average for the headline index was 52.6, and for new orders 50.0.Here is the manufacturing and services numbers for the past three years:The economically weighted average for the month of June alone is 52.9,",

No one would have expected the current outcome. This sharpens your intuition and also tests expected relationships.We are now in a place with US stock indices touching all time highs and a widening of breath beyond the large cp tech sector. The markets have looked through uncertainty. Some of that uncertainty has been resolved, but that does not alter the underlying view that we are in an environment with a wide range of views.
