With overwhelming evidence that we are living through a political Zeitenwende, this summer ECFR is taking a deep dive into the “post-liberal revolution”—starting with a new podcast series on the so-called “New Right”. In the first episode, Mark Leonard is joined by Ivan Krastev, founding board member of ECFR, chair of the Centre for Liberal Strategies in Sofia and permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences at IWM Vienna. Mark and Ivan discuss the emergence of the New Right and its implications for liberalism and European politics. After all, only by understanding how the New Right develops and frames its ideas can mainstream parties and institutions survive the transition to a potential new era of global politics. Does liberalism have a future? What is the nature of the main political challenges to the old order? ",

    "fullContent": "Here is an NBER paper from May that I do not think I covered: We evaluate the aggregate effects of a change in tariffs on the US and world economies when tariff revenue is used to enact fiscal reform. Our model combines a standard international model of fiscal policy with taxes and a dynamic model of trade participation and tariffs that allows for uncertainty and transitions. We consider effects of permanent and temporary tariffs–with and without retaliation–when tariff revenue is used to reduce taxes on capital or labor or to subsidize investment. Compared to a lump sum redistribution, using tariff revenue for these reforms always boosts economic activity. Key to our analysis is the effect of trade dynamics on import substitution, such that tariff revenue after an increase in tariffs is higher in the short run than in the long run. When increasing the tariff by 20 percentage points, the revenue raised is largest when tariffs are temporary, unilateral, and used to subsidize investment,",
