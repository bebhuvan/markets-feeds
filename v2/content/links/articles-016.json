    "fullContent": "Even strong defenders of childcare sometimes rely on the economic case that childcare programs keep workers in the labor force. While it‚Äôs not wrong, that argument misses the true role of childcare: social infrastructure that keeps families connected. Volunteer counselor Ann McNamee reads a book with a child who attends Project Camp, which provided free childcare to families impacted by wildfires, at Eagle Rock Recreation Center on January 15, 2025, in Los Angeles, California. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) This piece is adapted from Raising a Nation: 10 Reasons Every American Has a Stake in Child Care For All by Elliot Haspel (Oxford University Press, released August 11, 2025). If there‚Äôs one thing Democratic and Republican politicians can agree on, it‚Äôs that childcare is the workforce behind the workforce. ‚ÄúOur child care workers are the workforce behind the workforce, risking their health and safety on the front lines to ensure that parents can go to work,‚Äù then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in 2020. Republican representative Ashley Hinson echoed Pelosi in 2024, asserting that childcare staff ‚Äúare the workforce behind the workforce, and I don‚Äôt want to see parents having to make that choice between working or staying home because of the availability‚Äù of slots. Yes, childcare helps the economy hum. But childcare does so much more than just keep parents participating in the labor force. It is an essential piece of social infrastructure. As social cohesion declines, so too does the American quality of life ‚Äî and this trend hits parents hard, with two-thirds of parents reporting feeling socially disconnected. Childcare centers are one of the few supports available to connect parents of young children to each other and their broader communities, easing the burden of isolation. The ‚Äúworkforce behind the workforce‚Äù line misses that richness and sets the childcare system on the path to corporatization. According to former US surgeon general Vivek Murthy, the country is going through an epidemic of loneliness, and parents in particular are struggling. Their ‚Äúdisproportionately high levels of loneliness,‚Äù Murthy has said, ‚Äúcompound the day-to-day challenges they face.‚Äù When people become isolated and disconnected, community bonds fray and it becomes much harder to forge the solidaristic movements needed to improve conditions for all. Childcare programs stand out as a potential beacon amid this dark forecast. Sociologist Mario Luis Small studied childcare centers in New York City and found that they ‚Äútend to be a remarkably effective broker for the mothers whose children they service. They broker both social and organizational ties, and their brokerage is associated with greater material and mental well-being.‚Äù In his analysis, Small found that among mothers who utilized centers, ‚Äúabout 60% made at least one friend, and more than 40% made three or more friends in centers.‚Äù Childcare educators frequently function as a source of stability that keeps families from spiraling into crisis. They can offer emotional attunement and practical help, like connecting parents to food programs, keeping children‚Äôs routines steady during family upheaval, or stepping in with extra guidance when a child struggles emotionally or academically. In the childcare documentary Make a Circle, preschool educator Dan recalls how important his childcare providers were as he grew up with a single mother and struggled with learning disabilities. ‚ÄúMy mom was both my parents, and my other parent was my preschool teachers,‚Äù Dan says, voice thick with emotion. ‚ÄúThey helped my mom when she needed assistance. They helped me. They helped my family. They, in essence, I feel, saved my life.‚Äù Childcare also helps keep families rooted in their communities rather than having to move away in search of viable care options, which can be scarce in both rural and urban areas. As Qweyonoh Parker, a public-school teacher and mother of three in the Minneapolis region, wrote in a 2024 letter to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, ‚ÄúI can either sideline my career to care for my three children or go into debt to pay for child care. . . . I am seriously considering moving to Illinois, where I have family, not because I want to, but because I cannot see a path that allows me to work and raise my children in Minnesota.‚Äù Childcare programs can even be key players in disaster relief efforts. A 2023 report from the US Early Years Climate Action Task Force recounts the story of one such provider: Susan Gilmore runs North Bay Children‚Äôs Center, a California child care network with 13 locations. Her network contended with wildfires and their effects. She and her staff tracked children and families: who was evacuated, who lost their homes, and who needed resources. They set up a command center and created a spreadsheet to track every family‚Äîa difficult feat since many of the families they serve don‚Äôt own their home, or had evacuated, or were staying with relatives. Many families lacked power and food. Staff linked them to food banks and, when it was safe, brought resources to them. Seeing all of the different ways childcare programs contribute to healthy families and communities makes it all the more concerning that the system is under so much strain, facing widespread closures and high staff turnover while profit-seeking investors like private equity firms circle overhead. Many politicians and advocates have responded to this strain by doubling down on the economic case, defending childcare programs on the basis that they ensure companies have workers and workers have paychecks. Yet perhaps counterintuitively, overemphasizing the economic benefits of childcare can get in the way of the larger mindset shift needed to reposition care in American thought and policy. Valuing childcare slots primarily for their function in attaching parents to the labor force can breed indifference to how those slots are supplied. For instance, big investor-backed companies like KinderCare and Bright Horizons are regularly welcomed by Democratic politicians despite the fact that their business models inherently rely on a market-based, commodified view of care ‚Äî and the fact that they have actively worked against goals of universal childcare. These chains are clear in their financial filings that they benefit from the existing market system with sliding-scale government subsidies and few guardrails on profit-seeking (a design present in the dominant Democratic childcare bill, the Child Care for Working Families Act) while being threatened by any governmental guarantee for free or low-cost care. If the argument is simply that the economy needs more available childcare slots, regardless of the particular characteristics of providers, then KinderCare and Bright Horizons are unobjectionable. There is an inherent tension in speaking of childcare as a public good deserving of large outlays from the public purse while reducing it to an instrumental enabler of work. If its only utility is to help people participate in the workforce, then people might be expected to secure it themselves, the same way people buy cars to get to their jobs. As sociologist and Canadian childcare advocate Susan Prentice has written, ‚ÄúEconomic reframing displaces the justice-based rationale for child care. . . . The business case for child care builds an ideological/conceptual bridge to contemporary wealth production, not to social transformation.‚Äù This may also be why the fastest-growing part of the childcare sector is large for-profit chains backed by institutional investors, or why policymakers are increasingly turning to voluntary employer-provided benefits as a would-be solution. If the guiding principle of childcare is merely to help parents work, then there is little value in cultivating excellent programs with well-compensated, trained, reliable educators; little value in foregrounding community-based programs with deep attachments to the neighborhoods they serve. Proponents of corporate childcare provision often argue that there is value in standardized brand-name trust, and that economies of scale help chains maintain supply in a financially difficult sector. Yet as the writer Noelle Bodick has written, ‚ÄúAltogether, corporate day care reverses the natural order of human allegiances: you can‚Äôt trust in fickle individuals, but you can trust in LLCs, vast systems, corporate oversight and the cameras.‚Äù While chain sites can be high-quality and at times do integrate themselves into the community, many aren‚Äôt and don‚Äôt. Either way, it‚Äôs difficult to square a form of care that was in its early days compared to fast-food chains with what a truly abundant and community-driven childcare system should look like. This is a moment to step back and alter course. There is no reason to continue pushing the same workforce-behind-the-workforce messaging or embracing overly means-tested, technocratic policies that have little resonance with the public and frequently exclude relative caregivers and stay-at-home parents. It‚Äôs notable that not only did New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani win his primary with an agenda that includes universal, tax-funded, free-at-the-point-of-service childcare, but that other candidates were falling over themselves to offer big, bold childcare plans. Mamdani‚Äôs stated rationale has less to do with the city economy and more with allowing families with children to stay in the city they love. To be clear: the economic and workforce arguments for childcare are valid and have their place. But they need to be nested properly within a values-laden, family- and community-centered vision. We won‚Äôt get the childcare system American families need and deserve until we loudly make the case that childcare is as much a part of a community‚Äôs social infrastructure as schools, libraries, and parks, and equally deserving of public support for the same reasons. The good news is that when you let the full benefits of childcare come into focus, it‚Äôs a rather easy case to make.",

    "fullContent": "Massachusetts Sheriff Federally Indicted On Extortion Charges Tied To Boston Weed Business A Massachusetts county sheriff, Steven W. Tompkins, 67, was federally indicted on charges of extorting an executive at a cannabis company so that he could own stock in the business - and then demanded his money back when his investment dropped in value, according to the US Attorney's Office. Tompkins - who has led the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department since his 2013 appointment, was indicted on two counts of extortion under color of official right. The cannabis company, which was unnamed in the announcement, applied for a license to open a retail dispensary in Boston in 2019 - which required a 'positive impact plan' or PIP, which was satisfied by a partnership with the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department in order to employ released offenders as part of a re-entry program. According to federal prosecutors, Tompkins pressured a company executive to allow him to purchase stock as the company prepared to go public. The executive, who feared the sheriff could use his position to threaten the PIP plan and their licensing approval - or impact the timing of their IPO, bent the knee to Tompkins' demands. In November 2020, Tompkins wired $50,000 to purchase stock at around $1.73 per share. After a reverse stock split, he was left with 14,417 shares at a price of $3.46 per share. When the IPO launched in 2021, the stock was valued at around $9.60 per share, however by May of 2022 the stock's value had dropped and Tompkins had lost money on the investment. He then demanded a refund of his $50,000 - which the company executive agreed to, and did so in the form of checks issued between May 2022 and July 2023. The executive wrote \"loan repayment\" or \"company expense\" to hide their nature, 10 Boston reports. \"Elected officials, particularly those in law enforcement, are expected to be ethical, honest and law abiding ‚Äì not self-serving. His alleged actions are an affront to the voters and taxpayers who elected him to his position, and the many dedicated and honest public servants at the Suffolk County Sheriff‚Äôs Department. The people of Suffolk County deserve better,\" US Attorney Leah B. Foley wrote in a media release. More via the release: As Sheriff, Tompkins oversees approximately 1,000 correctional officers and other employees responsible for operating and maintaining correctional facilities in Boston at the House of Correction and the Nashua Street Jail. The charges of extortion under color of official right each provide for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and statutes which govern the determination of a sentence in a criminal case. U.S. Attorney Foley and FBI SAC Docks made the announcement. Special assistance was provided by the Internal Revenue Service. Assistant United States Attorneys John Mulcahy of the Public Corruption & Special Prosecutions Unit and Dustin Chao, Chief of the Public Corruption & Special Prosecutions Unit are prosecuting the case. The details contained in the charging documents are allegations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

    "fullContent": "In Major U-Turn, Mexico Approves Fracking To Reverse Sagging Oil And Gas Production By Tsvetana Paraskova of OilPrice.com In a major U-turn in energy policy, Mexico has unveiled a 10-year plan to reverse a years-long decline in oil and gas production by tapping more unconventional resources through fracking. Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, the world‚Äôs most indebted energy firm, has seen declines in its output in recent years as old shallow-water conventional fields mature. Now the government and its state-controlled energy giant want to revitalize production via fracking, Reuters reports, citing the revitalization plan. In the late 2010s, then-President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto sought to open shale basins, including the Burgos Basin, a shale-rich basin in northeastern Mexico, for natural gas exploration and development by private companies. However, Pe√±a Nieto‚Äôs successor, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, cancelled the contracts. Former president Lopez Obrador ruled out fracking during his term in office between 2018 and 2024. But his successor and mentee, current President Claudia Sheinbaum, has agreed to give the green light increased fracking despite a campaign pledge last year that she would not allow it. ‚ÄúWe're going to address all the geological potential we have,‚Äù Reuters quoted Pemex chief executive Victor Rodriguez as saying during a presentation of the plan. Pemex has been fracking onshore fields close to the Gulf of Mexico coast, but it does not report shale production separately and it is not clear how much the fracking has contributed to output. It‚Äôs clear that most of oil and gas production comes from conventional resources at old offshore platforms in shallow waters. The steady decline in Pemex‚Äôs output and the tense trade and tariff relations with the U.S. has apparently prompted Mexico to expand domestic fracking in a bid to reduce its high dependence on natural gas imports from the United States. Over the past decade, Mexican imports of U.S. natural gas, mostly via pipelines, have jumped thanks to new pipelines built between the U.S. and Mexico. Mexico has an estimated 545 Tcf of technically recoverable shale gas resources, the sixth largest in the world, per U.S. government data. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/08/2025 - 14:45",
