    "fullContent": "Wind Giant Orsted Suffers Worst Week On Record As Green Energy Demise Accelerates Wind company Orsted A/S was once the poster child of the green energy movement, debuting on European stock exchanges nine years ago. Now, with the green energy industry in shambles as common-sense energy policies return under the Trump administration, Orsted has suffered its worst weekly decline ever, trading far below its IPO price. At the beginning of the week, Orsted announced a rights offering of up to 60 billion kroner ($9.4 billion), sending shares crashing and leaving them down about 33% by week's end. Shares have fallen below their 2016 IPO price. Wall Street analysts are 71.9% \"Hold,\" 15.6% \"Sell,\" and 12.5% \"Buy\"... With wind farm construction as its core business, Orsted has been exposed to more canceled projects than any of its industry peers, including ones in the US and the UK. The funding gap swelled after scrapping a stake sale in the Sunrise Wind project off New York. Goldman analysts led by Alberto Gandolfi called the rights offering \"largely unexpected, with clarity expected by mid-September… but also a clean-up move.\" Compounding problems for Orsted, S&P Global Ratings downgraded the company's long-term credit rating to BBB-, just one notch below junk status. The rating agency cited Orsted's inability to carry out project refinancing and divest 50% of its Sunrise project. At Orsted's market capitalization peak, it was once worth more than BP and flagged a 'green' success by Wall Street, politicians, and leftist climate nonprofits. Orsted's collapse in market value, credit downgrade, and capital raise mirrors the implosion of the entire green industry. We suspect that Solyndra-type failures could be on the horizon. Keep in mind, one of the Democratic Party's pillars is all things green. Tyler Durden Fri, 08/15/2025 - 07:45",

    "fullContent": "Democrats Plan Nationwide Protests Over Redistricting Authored by Chase Smith via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), Democrats and allied advocacy groups are set to launch a series of protests on Saturday, Aug. 16, targeting Republican-led redistricting plans they say are designed to secure long-term control of the U.S. House. California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks at a press conference, accompanied by Texas Democratic legislators, at the governor’s mansion in Sacramento, Calif., on Aug. 8, 2025. Reuters/Carlos Barria The “Fight the Trump Takeover” National Day of Action, organized by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Texas for All coalition, and dozens of national and state partners, will feature nearly 150 rallies in at least 34 states. Demonstrators plan to gather at state capitols, city halls, and community spaces, with the largest event to be held outside the Texas Capitol in Austin, according to organizers. The campaign began in Texas, where state House Democrats left the state earlier this month to deny a quorum and block a GOP proposal to redraw congressional districts. The Texas Senate passed the map on Aug. 12 in a 19–2 vote after most Democrats walked out of the chamber. The plan would give Republicans five additional congressional seats in the 2026 midterms. Gov. Greg Abbott has vowed to call as many special sessions as necessary to see it passed, while Democrats argue the proposal is unconstitutional and unfairly targets districts led by minority lawmakers. Republicans have defended the effort, saying the changes are legally justified and necessary to address concerns raised by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in early July. The DOJ concerns cited possible “coalition districts” drawn based on racial demographics, which it said could violate the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment. Texas Republicans also say Democrats have supported redistricting when it benefits them politically, and that GOP-led states should have the same opportunity to maximize partisan advantage. “Though this fight started in Texas, it doesn’t end here,” Drucilla Tigner, executive director of Texas for All, said in a statement emailed to The Epoch Times. “This isn’t just about redistricting or one state’s politics. It’s about the future of our democracy.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom has also weighed in, with his latest message warning that if Republicans proceed with mid-decade redistricting in Texas and other states, California will consider redrawing its own congressional lines to offset GOP gains. In a letter to President Donald Trump, Newsom urged him to tell Texas Republicans to abandon the plan, calling it a “hyper-partisan gerrymander” and an “affront to American democracy.” DNC Chair Ken Martin said the party has been mobilizing volunteers and resources in support of Texas Democrats, including sending more than 250,000 text messages to residents and coordinating national media outreach. “Now, the DNC is supporting Texas for All and state and national partners with the biggest Day of Action yet,“ Martin said in the statement to The Epoch Times. ”Democrats will never stop fighting for all Americans’ voices to be heard—in Texas and across the country.” Labor groups are also joining the effort. “From Texas to California to Illinois, the labor movement is united in resisting the Trump takeover,” Rick Levy, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, said in the statement. “This is a defining battle for the future of our democracy, and working people across the country understand the urgent need to act. As this fight continues to spread nationwide, we will stand strong this Saturday—to defend our votes, protect our rights, and stop this redistricting scheme.” Organizers say the protests are part of a broader push for redistricting reform, including the creation of independent commissions and greater transparency in map-drawing.

The data, via Visual Capitalist's Pallavi Rao, for this visualization comes from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, compiled by StatsAmerica. These figures include pre-tax earnings from: wages, insurance & government business & rental income, interest, and dividends, unadjusted for living costs. It does not include capital gains from selling stock. Ranked: U.S. States With the Highest Income in 2024 Washington, D.C. holds the highest per capita personal income in the nation at $108,233, boosted by a concentration of high-paying government, legal, and consulting jobs. Rank State Code Per Capita Personal Income (2024) 1 DC DC $108,233 2 Massachusetts MA $93,927 3 Connecticut CT $93,235 4 Wyoming WY $85,945 5 New York NY $85,733 6 California CA $85,518 7 New Jersey NJ $84,071 8 Washington WA $83,938 9 New Hampshire NH $82,878 10 Colorado CO $82,705 11 Maryland MD $78,538 12 Virginia VA $77,093 13 Alaska AK $75,247 14 Minnesota MN $74,943 15 Illinois IL $74,197 16 South Dakota SD $73,959 17 Nebraska NE $71,859 18 Pennsylvania PA $71,148 19 North Dakota ND $70,966 20 Oregon OR $70,685 21 Florida FL $70,390 22 Vermont VT $70,086 23 Rhode Island RI $69,936 24 Hawaii HI $69,520 25 Delaware DE $69,282 26 Nevada NV $68,657 27 Maine ME $68,129 28 Kansas KS $68,038 29 Texas TX $67,942 30 Montana MT $67,615 31 Wisconsin WI $67,586 32 Utah UT $66,443 33 Tennessee TN $64,908 34 North Carolina NC $64,855 35 Missouri MO $64,740 36 Arizona AZ $64,456 37 Ohio OH $64,225 38 Indiana IN $63,802 39 Iowa IA $63,573 40 Michigan MI $63,221 41 Oklahoma OK $62,661 42 Georgia GA $62,393 43 Idaho ID $61,836 44 Louisiana LA $61,332 45 South Carolina SC $59,995 46 Arkansas AR $59,663 47 New Mexico NM $57,652 48 Kentucky KY $57,526 49 Alabama AL $56,684 50 West Virginia WV $55,138 51 Mississippi MS $52,017 Massachusetts follows at $93,927, powered by its robust education, healthcare, and tech sectors. Connecticut, with its strong finance and insurance industries, comes in third at $93,235. All three leaders are at nearly twice the income last-ranked Mississippi ($52,017), reflecting the impact of specialized, high-skill industries on local income levels. Meanwhile, New York ($85,733), New Jersey ($84,071), and New Hampshire ($82,878) keep the broader Northeast near the top of the distribution. America’s West: The Tech Juggernaut California ($85,518) and Washington ($83,938) both place in the top 10 states by income. Their high incomes are linked to thriving technology and innovation economies, with major employers like Apple, Microsoft, and Google anchoring the regions. These states also attract high-skilled migrants, further boosting wage levels. American South Incomes Still Underperform The bottom of the ranking is dominated by Southern states, with Mississippi at $52,017 and West Virginia at $55,138. Lower wages, coupled with economies centered on agriculture and lower-wage manufacturing, contribute to these figures. These same states also have a higher rate of poverty, but also a lower cost of living.

With spending on players smashing $5 billion this summer, this business model is becoming so big it’s moving beyond niche financiers to start drawing the largest names in the world of private lending. “Certainly it’s an area we’re involved in, we think is interesting — we think it represents compelling risk reward,” said Tristram Leach, head of Europe credit at Apollo,",

    "fullContent": "Knife Crime In Germany Surges, With Foreigners Heavily Over-Represented In Latest Figures Authored by Thomas Brooke via Remix News, The number of violent knife crimes in Germany has risen sharply once again, with newly released Federal Police figures confirming a worsening trend. In the first half of 2025, 730 cases were recorded under Federal Police jurisdiction, a 17 percent increase compared to the same period last year. The data, provided by the German government in response to a parliamentary query from Alternative for Germany (AfD) domestic affairs spokesman Martin Hess and obtained by Junge Freiheit, show a marked overrepresentation of foreign suspects. Out of the recorded offenses, 278 involved German suspects and 270 involved non-Germans. While foreigners make up just under 15 percent of Germany’s population, they accounted for over 36 percent of knife crime suspects. Among them, Syrians formed the largest group with 29 cases, followed by Afghans with 23 and Poles with 20. Algerian and Afghan suspects were among the most likely to use a knife rather than merely carry one, with 83 percent of cases involving actual use. The Federal Police recorded the majority of incidents at train stations, with 409 cases. Hess said the figures were “largely a direct consequence of mass migration,” accusing left-wing parties of “denial of reality” and warning that public spaces must not become “places of fear.” He criticized symbolic measures such as weapon-free zones and said that effective border controls and large-scale deportations had yet to be implemented. Knife violence is not confined to Berlin, though the capital’s police force drew ridicule last year for website advice suggesting that victims sing loudly to deter attackers — a tip later removed after public backlash. In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, knife crime rose 20.7 percent in 2024, following a 44 percent jump the previous year. There, foreigners make up just 16.1 percent of the population but 47.6 percent of knife crime suspects. In May, German criminal lawyer Udo Vetter warned that the country has “imported knife violence” following several high-profile incidents, including a Kosovar man injuring a 12-year-old girl and two others, a Syrian asylum seeker stabbing five people outside a student bar, and a rioter wounding a police officer. He pointed to cultural norms where knives are carried as status symbols. Manuel Ostermann of the Federal Police Union also called for urgent action, warning that the knife “always immediately poses a concrete threat to life and limb” and that politicians must use all available measures to curb the trend.
