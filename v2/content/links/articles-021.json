Speaking to reporters after the raid, Ben Gvir said: <strong>\"The Temple Mount is for the Jews, and we will remain here forever.\"</strong></p> <p>Since becoming a minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, Ben Gvir has led at least 11 assaults on the mosque. Meanwhile, several other far-right politicians have <strong>advocated for the destruction of Al-Aqsa and the construction of a temple where they claim Jewish temples once stood</strong>.</p> <p>Among the hundreds of people to take part in Sunday's raid was right-wing Likud lawmaker Amit Halevi, who has repeatedly advocated for Israel to destroy all water, food and energy sources in Gaza.</p> <p>In June 2023, he tabled a bill that would divide Al-Aqsa Mosque between Muslims and Jews, a plan that would see shared access from the courtyard of the Dome of the Rock to the end of the northern border of Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p> <p>Palestinians fear that the incursions at Al-Aqsa, which have intensified since Israel went to war on Gaza in October 2023, are laying the groundwork for the mosque to be divided similar to how the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron was in the 1990s.</p> <p>Muslims currently have limited access to that site, and just last month, Israel transferred the authority of the mosque from the Palestinian-run Hebron municipality to a settler council.</p> <p>Aouni Bazbaz, the director of international affairs at the Islamic Waqf, the organisation that administers Al-Aqsa Mosque, described Sunday's raid as \"painful and regrettable\", telling MEE that it was a threat to the \"historical status quo and an incitement to violence\".</p> <p>\"There were terrifying numbers of people [Israeli settlers] present and some were important figures,\" he said. \"This was part of a project. The extreme religious right seeks to undermine the status quo and to clearly follow the example of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.</p> <p>\"There are no worshippers here right now, the place is empty, the Old City is empty. <strong>It's a military barracks</strong>,\" he added.</p> <p>The Jerusalem Governorate also decried the raid, and appealed to the international community, in particular Muslim states, \"to take immediate action\".</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir sparked fresh outrage today after performing Talmudic rituals inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, accompanied by an associate who carried out the “epic prostration”, a form of Jewish worship explicitly prohibited at the site <a href=\"https://t.co/pv3aKSaJvc\">pic.twitter.com/pv3aKSaJvc</a></p> — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MiddleEastEye/status/1951940076071473266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>\"What happened today is not just a traditional incursion.

As with previous actions, the protests were primarily <strong>attended by crazed, elderly white liberals</strong>. The Democrats and their NGO machine have lost not just the narrative but are drifting deeper into irrelevance. </p> <p>50501 (\"50 Protests, 50 States, 1 Movement\") is part of the <strong>permanent protest-industrial complex</strong> and was behind the underwhelming demonstrations this weekend. The group's mission is to organize large-scale, <strong>nationwide color revolution-style operations against President Trump</strong>, including these previous events:</p> <ul><li> <p><em>February 5: Anti-Trump kickoff rallies </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>February 17 (Presidents' Day): \"No Kings on Presidents Day\"</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>March 4: Third round of demonstrations</em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>April 5: \"Hands Off\" protests, among the largest anti-Trump protests </em></p> </li> <li> <p><em>June 14: \"No Kings\"</em></p> </li> </ul><p><strong>Each of the nationwide protests listed above has failed to generate enough momentum</strong> to shift public opinion and move the polls. The dark-money-funded NGOs behind the permanent protest-industrial complex have grown increasingly frustrated; so much so that they reportedly offered $20 million to a 'rent-a-protester' firm. </p> <p>Last month, Adam Swart, CEO of an activist group called \"Crowds on Demand\", called out one unnamed leftist entity ...</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"</em><strong><em>We had to reject an offer worth around $20 million for nationwide, large-scale demonstrations across the country. Personally, I don't think it's effective. I'm rejecting the contract not because I don't want the business, but because, frankly, this is going to be ineffective and make us all look bad</em></strong><em>.\"</em></p> </blockquote> <p>\"One of the more <strong>bizarre highlights of this past weekend's failed protest operation was a 50501 staffer setting up what appeared to be a \"smash room\" for deranged white leftists </strong>in the parking lot of a retail center in Tim Walz's state.</p> <p>\"After smashing a watermelon, one attendee screamed \"<strong>REVOLUTION</strong>\" stating that the experience was \"cathartic\" and left her shaking,\" journalist Savanah Hernandez wrote on X. </p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Liberals in Minnesota are currently smashing watermelons and TVs to help expel their “rage” against the Trump admin.<br /><br /> After smashing a watermelon, one attendee screamed “REVOLUTION” stating that the experience was “cathartic” and left her shaking: <a href=\"https://t.co/9kpKnwojZ0\">pic.twitter.com/9kpKnwojZ0</a></p> — Savanah Hernandez (@sav_says_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sav_says_/status/1951704264184586728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>Hernandez said, \"<strong>Live look at the full event, which includes a scream tent, smash room and about 80 senior citizens</strong>.\"</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Live look at the full event, which includes a scream tent, smash room and about 80 senior citizens <a href=\"https://t.co/bItY4htp3J\">https://t.co/bItY4htp3J</a></p> — Savanah Hernandez (@sav_says_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sav_says_/status/1951704731606204574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p><strong>Related:</strong></p> <ul><li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/watch-rent-protester-ceo-rejects-20-million-contract-stage-anti-trump-protests\">Watch: Rent-A-Protester CEO Rejects $20 Million Contract To Stage Anti-Trump Protests</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/dark-money-network-funneled-millions-no-kings-nationwide-color-revolution-operation\">Dark-Money Network Funneled Millions Into 'No Kings' Nationwide Color Revolution Operation</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/watch-live-house-doge-subcommittee-exposes-public-funds-private-agendas-ngos-gone-wild\">House DOGE Subcommittee Exposes \"Public Funds, Private Agendas: NGOs Gone Wild\"</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/communist-billionaire-accused-funding-anti-ice-riots-mysteriously-vanishes\">Communist Billionaire Accused Of Funding Anti-ICE Riots Mysteriously Vanishes</a></em></p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/masked-protest-industrial-complex-isnt-peaceful-its-civil-terrorism-playbook-combat-chaos\">The Protest-Industrial-Complex Isn't Peaceful, It's \"Civil Terrorism\"...</a></em></p> </li> </ul><p>One alarming aspect of these ongoing color revolution operations by the Democrats and their NGO complex is the <strong>co-mingling of foreign interests</strong>.

Marsha Blackburn will soon introduce a trio of bills to counter the malign influence of foreign adversaries stateside and cement actions already taken by the Trump administration</strong>, RealClearPolitics is first to report.</p> <p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/693681_jpg%281%29.jpg?itok=52u-cSiu\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/693681_jpg%281%29.jpg?itok=52u-cSiu\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6b5d8879-86fb-41b9-bb8f-bdf202c644f8\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"351\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/693681_jpg%281%29.jpg?itok=52u-cSiu\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/BDC7C33B-9032-4D0A-9660-2635D5588ACF\">The first bill</a> would ban the purchase of “agricultural land” by any foreign individuals or businesses associated with an adversarial country. </strong>Chinese interests already own as much as 370,000 acres of farmland, <a href=\"https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/chinese-farmland-drone-attacks/\">according to one estimate,</a> some of it near U.S. military bases. Fueling <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2023/09/25/rcps_wegmann_to_agriculture_secretary_vilsack_is_the_us_monitoring_purchase_of_farmland_by_chinese_government_interests.html\">the bipartisan concern:</a> fears that proximity to those sensitive installations could make them prone to drone attack or surveillance.</p> <p>Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced last month that the federal government would move to ban sales of farmland nationwide to buyers tied to China. If signed into law, the Blackburn bill would deliver on that promise.</p> <p>While China is the primary target, the legislation would also prohibit purchases from North Korea, Iran, and Russia.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/500EB027-1844-468F-9757-F58AA0D5DD90\">The second bill</a> focuses on the capital city:</strong> It would require the District of Columbia to end so-called “sister city” arrangements with adversarial nations. Washington, D.C., has entered into no less than 15 non-formal arrangements with cities around the world. Some are innocuous, such as Athens and Paris. One is a relic of hopes not realized.</p> <p>Then-Mayor Marion Barry signed the Washington-Beijing Sister City Friendship agreement in 1984 when the U.S. still hoped that normalizing relations with China would lead to liberalization. It did not. Blackburn and other Republicans now warn that “sister city” arrangements, while informal, provide an adversarial regime a sort of soft power through diplomatic legitimacy and access to sensitive U.S. institutions.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/369F964E-58D8-4FAC-8AD9-591CDF6D995A\">The third bill</a> would require the Department of Housing and Urban Development to work with state and local governments to assess whether and how foreign buyers, including those using shell corporations, “are distorting U.S. housing markets and threatening national security.”</strong></p> <p>The legislation comes as Trump shakes up the world stage through a series of new trade deals and reevaluated alliances. Even as the president insists that U.S. relations with China are improving, his administration has taken steps to gain an upper hand in the rivalry with the communist superpower. He has bolstered military spending. He has deregulated the artificial intelligence industry in order to maintain U.S. dominance in that field. He insists that the United States will remain preeminent.</p> <p>Perhaps most significantly, Trump made a rising China a bipartisan concern. While previous administrations cast a wary eye on an increasingly bellicose Beijing, his first candidacy thrust the issue front and center nearly a decade ago. And former President Joe Biden did not throttle back during his time in office, notably keeping Trump’s tariffs on China in place and describing the coming century as a competition between autocracy and democracy.</p> <p><strong>Blackburn shares those concerns. Her current effort focuses on the domestic front.</strong></p> <p>“The United States cannot allow foreign adversaries like Communist China to quietly embed themselves in our communities and near our critical infrastructure,” the senator told RCP.</p> <p>“We have a responsibility to identify and address these threats,” Blackburn added, before describing her legislative practice as an effort that “shines a light on these activities and will help protect American property and sovereignty.”</p> </div> <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span> <span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-08-03T18:00:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Sun, 08/03/2025 - 14:00</span>",
