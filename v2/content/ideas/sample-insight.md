The current monetary policy transmission mechanism shows interesting divergences from historical patterns. Worth monitoring how traditional rate channels interact with modern financial structures.

Key observations:
- Credit markets responding differently than equity markets
- Regional variations in policy effectiveness 
- Corporate balance sheet impacts vary by sector

This suggests a more nuanced approach to rate policy may be needed going forward.
