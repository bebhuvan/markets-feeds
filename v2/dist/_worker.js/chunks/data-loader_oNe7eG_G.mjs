		summary: "Ralf R. Meisenzahl, Friederike Niepmann, and Tim Schmidt-EisenlohrThis paper documents a new dollar channel that transmits monetary policy across borders. Exploiting unique features of the syndicated loan market for identification, we show that changes in the euro-dollar exchange rate around ECB monetary policy announcements that are orthogonal to simultaneous changes in euro-area interest rates and stock prices affect U.S. leveraged loan spreads. Specifically, in response to dollar appreciation, investors require higher compensation for risk, and borrowing costs for U.S. firms increase. These findings imply a causal link between the U.S. dollar and investors’ risk appetite.",

		summary: "Giovanni Favara, James Graham, and Geng LiHome-related spending in categories such as furnishings, renovations, and repairs is tied to housing market activity, with significant implications for aggregate expenditure dynamics. We refer to this relationship as the home purchase channel of expenditure. Using household-level panel data we estimate that home purchases lead to sizable increases in home-related spending, but not to increases in goods and services unrelated to home purchase. These findings are robust to the use of close-control groups and placebo tests. We then build a heterogeneous household model with housing, home renovations, and home-related durables that is calibrated to match our household-level evidence. Model simulations of housing market shocks generate large fluctuations in home-related and total expenditure. We show that the home purchase channel amplifies aggregate expenditure dynamics, with home-related spending accounting for around half of total spending fluctu",

		summary: "Israel’s June 12th attack on Iran’s nuclear and military facilities increased geopolitical risks (raising the risk of a broadening of the conflict across the region), pushed energy prices higher (and could have led to them going much higher, for example, if Iran had blocked the straits of Hormuz) with a negative impact on inflation, impacting the Fed’s ability/willingness to lower interest rates in response to weaker economic growth. While sharp increases in oil prices have been major factors in four prior recessions (1973, 1980, 1982, and 1990) Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy noted that while in 1973 one barrel of oil was responsible for $1,000 of gross domestic product, it’s now less than half that. In addition, unlike in 1973 when the US was a large net importer of energy, today we are a net exporter. According to the Fed’s FRBUS model of the US economy, a sustained $10 increase in oil prices would be expected to increase inflation by 0.4% and lower GDP by 0.4%.",

		summary: "Financial independence. It's the ultimate goal in personal finance. But is it all it's cracked up to be? Though financial independence is clearly better than financial dependence, many people race toward it without thinking through the possible consequences. As a result, they can end up creating a lifestyle that prioritizes money over everything and leads to increased stress. This hasty pursuit of financial independence is not just unnecessary, but sometimes counterproductive. I've seen people do this and I used to be like this as well. In my early 20s, I skipped out on some dinners with friends, passed on a few weekend trips, and avoided things that didn't move me closer to my financial goal. I cut costs mercilessly, believing that once I got to a certain point, everything else would fall into place. Historically, this is why I was a huge fan of financial independence. But as I've gotten closer to reaching that goal, I've realized that rushing to hit an arbitrary number may not be the",

		summary: "Pablo Cuba-Borda, Albert Queralto, Ricardo Reyes-Heroles, and Mikaël ScaramucciWe study how trade cost shocks influence inflation. Using bilateral trade flows from detailed global input-output data and a gravity framework, we estimate trade cost shocks and their effects on CPI inflation. Higher trade costs for final goods cause large but short-lived inflation spikes, while increased costs for intermediate inputs trigger more persistent inflation. A multi-country model of inflation with trade in final goods and intermediate inputs replicates these patterns. We show that trade cost shocks and tariffs on imported inputs transmit through global value chains and worsen monetary policy trade-offs. We use the model to quantify the effects of trade costs during the 2018–2019 U.S.-China trade war and to estimate the contribution of trade costs during the post-pandemic inflation surge. Novel data on U.S. domestic sourcing shores allow us to estimate trade cost shocks for the U.S. using Bayesian ",

		summary: "Sinem Hacioglu-Hoke, Leo Feler, and Jack ChylakUsing zip-code median income as a proxy for household income is common in economics but can mask heterogeneity and yield misleading conclusions. Using zip-code median income and self-reported household incomes from a representative panel of 150,000 U.S. households, we decompose average retail spending for 2018-2024. When using self-reported incomes, we observe substantial divergence in spending between low- and high-income households starting in mid-2021. When using zip-code aggregates as a proxy, this divergence disappears. Our findings indicate a 35 to 75 percent discrepancy between zip-code aggregates and self-reported incomes, highlighting the limitation of zip-code aggregates as a proxy for household incomes.",

		summary: "Oleg SokolinskiyThis paper estimates trading costs in the off-the-run Treasury market using comprehensive transactions data and machine learning techniques. The analysis reveals several key findings that enhance the understanding of the off-the-run Treasury market liquidity. First, the indicative bid-ask spread is shown to be a biased measure of liquidity, even when not considering transaction volume. Specifically, bid-ask spreads systematically overstate trading costs of more seasoned Treasuries, and the liquidity of benchmark, on-the-run securities affects how off-the-run bid-ask spreads map to trading costs. Second, the paper demonstrates that trading costs may scale non-monotonically with transaction volume, which suggests selective, opportunistic liquidity-taking. Additionally, transaction size has greater effect on off-the-run securities’ trading costs when benchmark, on-the-run liquidity is lower. Finally, indicative bid-ask spreads may notably overstate trading costs for larger",

GrishchenkoWe apply natural language processing tools to news articles in the financial press to construct a sentiment index—an index of the perceived semantic orientation of monetary policy communications around scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. To that end, we develop several dictionaries that capture various monetary policy tools: conventional monetary policy, asset purchases, and forward guidance. The surprises in the sentiment index around FOMC meetings announcements explain variation in major asset prices classes between May 1999 and November 2022. Sentiment index surprises are important for explaining the variation in asset prices beyond monetary policy surprises.",

		summary: "Eric EngstromAmid ongoing trade policy shifts and geopolitical uncertainty, concerns about stagflation have reemerged as a key macroeconomic risk. This paper develops a probabilistic framework to estimate the likelihood of stagflation versus soft landing scenarios over a four-quarter horizon. Building on Bekaert, Engstrom, and Ermolov (2025), the model integrates survey forecasts, structural shock decomposition, and a non-Gaussian BEGE-GARCH approach to capture time-varying volatility and skewness. Results suggest that the probability of stagflation was elevated at around 30 percent in late 2022, while the chance of a soft landing was below 5 percent. As inflation moderated and growth remained strong through 2024, these probabilities reversed. However, by mid-2025, renewed tariff concerns drove stagflation risk back up and the probability of a soft landing lower. These shifts highlight the potential value of distributional forecasting for policymakers and market participants navigating",

Or are there actual ways to increase your earnings without needing to increase your effort? The truth is somewhere in between. Yes, it's possible to increase your income without increasing your effort, but only if you change your strategy. This is the premise of my upcoming book, The Wealth Ladder, which comes out in 2 weeks. The core idea: the strategy that got you to one point in your financial life may not get you to the next. This is true whether you're trying to build wealth or simply earn more. Too often we get stuck in the same routines while expecting different results. But, when it comes to making more without working more, the answer isn't necessarily to work harder, but to work differently.

		summary: "- by New Deal democratLast month the new orders components of the economically weighted ISM manufacturing and services indexes warranted the hoisting of a yellow flag “Recession Watch.” This month that continued.To recap, because manufacturing is much less important to the economy than in the decades before the Millennium, the economically weighted average of the ISM services index (75%) as well as manufacturing (25%), especially over a three month period, has been much more accurate since 2000.Last week the ISM manufacturing index for June came in at 49.0, and its three month average was 48.7. The new orders subindex came in at 46.4, and its three month average was 47.1. On Thursday the non-manufacturing index was reported at 54.2, and the new orders index at 51.3. The three month average for the headline index was 52.6, and for new orders 50.0.Here is the manufacturing and services numbers for the past three years:The economically weighted average for the month of June alone is 52.9,",

		summary: "We have lived through uncertainty, a war, trade battles, and various events that should have pushed markets lower; yet, we are at the highs in the core US market indices. This does not feel expected or normal.One of my favorite exercises is to play out scenarios - what would you have expected to happen if a particular event occurred, and then examine the reality. No one would have expected the current outcome. This sharpens your intuition and also tests expected relationships.We are now in a place with US stock indices touching all time highs and a widening of breath beyond the large cp tech sector.

As I wrote Friday, underneath the headlines, this was a barely positive report - with some significant negatives. Let me point out a couple of the big ones today.The headline was 147,000 jobs added, about average for the past year:So it’s all good, right? Not so fast.That 147,000 breaks down to 74,000 private jobs + 63,000 education (and 10,000 other). In the past six years, only 3 other times have public sector jobs (including education and all other government jobs) been such a large component of the total gain:And the simple reason is that education employment is highly seasonal, with layoffs in May through July, and rehiring in August through October, as shown in the below graph where the non-seasonally adjusted numbers are in light blue, the seasonally adjusted ones in dark blue - and even then, I’ve had to divide the NSA numbers by ",

The traditional approach to addressing this problem is to utilize a rolling window to adjust beta over time; however, this method does not account for the changing environment. It just increases the use of new information.A new paper, \"Conditional Betas: A Non-Standard Approach,\" attempts to find a new method to account for changing beta. It compares the quality of beta forecasts with one of the leading alternatives of windsorizing the data for beta. The overall effect of a simple machine learning approach is very positive. Results are strong and only based on past price data. This is worth further exploration. I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to see a hedge balanced trade fall apart because the beta estimate is wrong. Market neutral is no longer market neutral. This may not seem like a significant issue for long-only managers, but for a long/short portfolio, it is a substantial problem.",

		summary: "One of the topics that has received attention in microfinance research is the discussion of what constitutes a safe asset and whether it is in short supply. During a crisis, there is an increased demand for safe assets that are information-insensitive and serve as a means to protect wealth. A simple example of a safe asset is the US Treasury bill. When there is high uncertainty, investors tend to sell risky assets and shift to safer ones. However, if there is a shortage of these safe assets, the price will be bid up, placing downward pressure on interest rates. Nevertheless, there is the assumption that the supposed safe asset will really be safe. That is, the risk or market uncertainty cannot come from the producer of the safe asset. If there is an increase in risk from the safe asset, it will lose its convenience yield, and it will no longer be uncorrelated with risky assets. In this case, there will be a demand for alternative safe assets. One alternative is gold. Gold is often unco",

		summary: "Public goods are meant to be universal, but they are inherently place-based. This paper systematically measures spatial access to public goods and quantifies the implications of distance to public facilities for income inequality. First, we map all schools and hospitals across Belgium. We compute the distance to facilities for each of the 20,000 neighborhoods and document large spatial inequalities in access to public facilities. Second, we find that this unequal distribution favors high-income neighborhoods: allocating public goods spending proportionally to our access index increases income inequality compared to measures based solely on disposable income. Third, we show that the positive relationship between income and access can be rationalized by a simple model of public goods allocation with an inequality-neutral social planner. Finally, we provide evidence that access is strongly correlated with educational and health outcomes, emphasizing the need to consider the place-based na",

		summary: "We study equilibrium outcomes in a model with monetary-fiscal interaction when Ricardian Equivalence fails and argue that the latter feature has fundamental consequences. First, there is no longer any clear distinction between active and passive fiscal policies - there is always some monetary-fiscal interaction. Second, the equilibrium displays local determinacy for a much larger range of monetary and fiscal rules than in representative agent models. Third, the Taylor principle no longer applies in the sense that it is neither necessary nor sufficient for local determinacy. Fourth, when Ricardian equivalence fails and the equilibrium is locally determinate, fiscal deficits are generally inflationary, and their timing matters. These results hold both in a simple three-equation New Keynesian model and in a medium-scale setting when agents have finite planning horizons.",

While not listed as critical, CVE-2025-49719 is a publicly disclosed information disclosure vulnerability, with all versions as far back as SQL Server 2016 receiving patches. Microsoft rates CVE-2025-49719 as less likely to be exploited, but the availability of proof-of-concept code for this flaw means its patch should probably be a priority for affected enterprises. Mike Walters, co-founder of Action1, said CVE-2025-49719 can be exploited without authentication, and that many third-party applications depend on SQL server and the affected drivers — potentially introducing a supply-chain risk that e",

		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20448",
		summary: "We develop a theory of first-mover advantage (FMA) grounded in decision-making ability and error propensity. Our simulation model demonstrates how small initial advantages compound through systematic differences in error rates between first- and second-movers. We show that FMA amplifies when both competitors have higher decision-making ability and when abilities are closely matched, whereas FMA increases for low complexity of the decision-making environment but decreases for higher complexity. To test these predictions, we analyze 3.66 million chess games, exploiting quasi-random assignment of move order and objective ability measures. Results strongly support our theory: FMA increases from 3.5% for low-ability players to 11% for high-ability players, peaks when competitors are evenly matched, and strengthens in complex decision environments. Move-level analysis reveals second-movers make larger errors when operating from disadvantageous positions under complexity, explaining FMA persi",

		summary: "We estimate the return to face-to-face interactions on worker mobility. Leveraging granular cellphone geolocation and sociodemographic data for 3.3 million workers in a major urban labor market over two years, we find that in-person meetings with employees at a given firm significantly increase the likelihood of transitioning to that firm -- an effect that exceeds that of phone calls and digital messaging. The influence of face-to-face interactions varies across demographic and occupational groups, with meeting frequency and composition helping to explain heterogeneity by gender, income, employment type, and industry. Our findings highlight the importance of in-person interactions as a key driver of labor mobility and a fundamental mechanism underpinning agglomeration economies.",

The U.K.’s National Crime Agency (NCA) declined verify the names of those arrested, saying only that they included two males aged 19, another aged 17, and 20-year-old female. Scattered Spider is the name given to an English-speaking cybercrime group known for using social engineering tactics to break into companies and steal data for ransom, often impersonating employees or contractors to deceive IT help desks into granting access.

		summary: "Momentum is a key factor found across all asset classes. It is persistent and perhaps the most used of the major risk factors. A paper I had not read before provides more light on the topic by showing that you can have both reversal and momentum with 1-month returns if you sort on turnover. The low turnover decile shows short-term reversals, while the high turnover decile shows momentum. See \"Short-term Momentum\".Reversal and momentum can coexist once you account for turnover. Large liquid stocks are less sensitive to price pressure effects. The price pressure effect is the main driver for short-term price moves and reversals, but turnover does matter. Don't fight short-term reversal unless you account for the turnover issue.",

With the usual one week delay, continuing claims, on the other hand, rose 10,000 to a new 4.5+ year high of 1.965 million:I can’t help but note that although the above numbers are seasonally adjusted, it is clear there is some residual unresolved post-pandemic seasonality nonetheless, as ever since the beginning of 2023 we have seen low numbers at the beginning of the year, rising through midyear, and then falling back down through the Holiday season.On the YoY% change more useful for forecasting, initial claims were up 2.3%, the four week moving average up 1.3%, and continuing claims up 5.9%:This continues to forecast weakness, but no recession. Interestingly, while there has been no substantial increase in new layoffs, those who are out of work are finding a more difficult time finding new jobs, as is",

Using daily data, we identify which announcements prompt households to revise their expectations. We construct two shock series—assuming households are either sophisticated or naive—based on the surprise components of announcements. Labor market news strongly influences both general economic sentiment and inflation expectations. Even when inflation rises and unemployment falls, households respond more to unemployment shocks. Most changes in inflation expectations are driven by labor market shocks. During negative supply and demand shocks, unemployment remains the dominant driver.",

		summary: "by John Aguirre, Alan Ledesma, Fernando Perez, Youel RojasThis paper studies how El Niño Costero, a large climatic event, generates physical risks disrupting business cycles and hindering the effectiveness of monetary policy. Using Peruvian data, we find consistent empirical evidence that El Niño shocks leave a footprint on the economy akin to a supply-side shock: it exerts inflationary pressures while simultaneously contracting GDP. The effects are very persistent and reflect the differentiated effects across sectors in the economy. Primary sectors response is more immediate and larger but persistent. Conversely, non-primary sectors experience lagged effects that become considerably more persistent and important later on. We integrate these empirical findings into a semi-structural model that incorporates five non-linear transmission channels through which El Niño affects the economy. These non-linearities present a challenge for monetary policy design, as the economic uncertainty and",

The speed of the decline is a concern, yet the dollar is still within a long-term range after a substantial gain. The question is whether the dollar is declining because there is less confidence in the US economy and financial system. It is a signal of US weakness, and that is a problem. The dollar remains the reserve currency, primarily due to its role as a medium of exchange; however, the store of value argument is problematic.",

		summary: "We study the design of market information in competing-mechanism games. We identify a new dimension, private disclosures, whereby the principals asymmetrically inform the agents of how their mechanisms operate. We show that private disclosures have two important effects. First, they can raise a principal's payoff guarantee against her competitors' threats. Second, they can support equilibrium outcomes and payoffs that cannot be supported with standard mechanisms. These results call for a novel approach to competing mechanisms, which we develop to identify a canonical game and a canonical class of equilibria, thereby establishing a new revelation principle for this class of environments.",

		summary: "- by New Deal democratOur data drought won’t end until next Tuesday. In the meantime, let me follow up on a theme from my analysis of the economic data from last week. To wit: there are several metrics that I have already stated are worth a “recession watch;” namely, housing units under construction (down almost 20% from peak), and the 3 month economically weighted ISM new orders subindexes (just into contraction territory at 49.3). Additionally, real aggregate nonsupervisory payrolls look like they may be rolling over. But there are many other measures that are not signaling a recession in the immediate near term (e.g, employment in the goods producing sector).As I noted several weeks ago, in the past 50+ years, in addition to COVID, almost always there has been a domestic political or geopolitical shock that has precipitated US recessions.

Broader use of foreign currency-denominated stablecoins could raise concerns about monetary sovereignty and, in some jurisdictions, erode the effectiveness of existing foreign exchange regulations. The principle of \"same risks, same regulation\" faces limitations in the context of stablecoins, highlighting the need for tailored regulatory approaches that address the nature and specific features of stablecoins.",

First, using customs and firm-to-firm transaction data that covers the universe of firms in Chile, we build the fossil fuel consumption and the direct CO2 emissions at the firm, sectoral, and aggregate levels. In line with the official national sources, the electricity generation sector is the most important contributor to aggregate CO2 emissions, followed by the manufacturing, transport, and mining sectors. Then, we study the role of input-output linkages in propagating CO2 emissions to the rest of the economy. To do so, we construct the production network and the carbon footprint at the firm level using firm-to-firm transaction data from the Chilean IRS, and we validate our results with the input-output tables approach used in th",

In the wrong hands, the internal review or study can be little more than a PR exercise, allowing the institution to acknowledge past wrongs while sidestepping accountability. In Yale and Slavery, David W. Blight will have none of this.",

		summary: "This paper studies the economic impact of commodity trade fragmentation. Using a novel production and trade dataset of 48 key commodities, we develop a partial equilibrium framework to identify the most vulnerable commodities to trade disruptions and assess the ensuing economic risks. Trade fragmentation can cause large price changes for many commodities, with minerals critical for the clean energy transition and selected agricultural commodities being the most vulnerable. The economic relevance of commodity trade fragmentation, measured by changes in consumer and producer surplus, varies across countries. However, offsetting effects across commodity exporting and importing countries, imply modest global surplus losses.",

But at least one indicator - the S&P 500 making another new all-time high on Thursday - I suspect is due to absolute complacency; namely, the TACO trade. Wall Street must believe that T—-p is going to chicken out again w/r/t his new tariff announcements.In any event, clicking over and reading will as usual bring you up to the virtual moment as to the state of the economy, and reward me a little bit for collecting and organizing it for you.",

		summary: "We consider a privately informed sender selecting a mediated communication device to influence players’ actions. In contrast to standard information design, there is no ex-ante commitment, and the communication device relies on information elicited from the informed parties. We define an informed communication equilibrium (ICE) as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium outcome of the informed mediated communication game. We show that the set of ICE is the subset of communication equilibria (CE) that yield sender payoff vectors bounded below by an equilibrium payoff vector of the silent game, under some consistent interim beliefs. The principal’s ex-ante optimal CE may not be an ICE. In sender-receiver games, the set of CE payoff vectors lies in the convex hull of the set of payoff vectors above silence. Hence, if the latter set is convex, as is the case when the sender has transparent motives, the sets of CE and ICE coincide.",

Professional traders do not produce the price bubbles observed with student subjects and aggregate private information better; bubbles also do not arise in mixed markets with traders and students trading together. Professional traders exhibit higher strategic sophistication than students as measured by their Guessing Game choices. We link strategic sophistication to trading in the financial market, and show that traders with higher levels of strategic sophistication earn higher capital gains and trading profits.",

		summary: "This paper provides econometric evidence on how exchange rates respond to tariffs. We construct a new tariff-shock database, which captures tariff-related announcements, threats and implementations by the U.S., China, the Euro Area and Canada between 2018 and 2020, and in 2025. Our shock measure accounts for both the size of tariff rates and their economic relevance. We show that exchange rates react to U.S. tariff shocks in systematically different ways depending on retaliation: the U.S. dollar (USD) appreciates if the tariff is imposed unilaterally, but depreciates if other countries retaliate. This empirical pattern resonates with the predictions of recent open-macro models with dominant currency pricing. In light of our evidence and drawing on theory, we conclude that the USD depreciation following the U.S. tariff announcement on April 2nd 2025 was not surprising. The spike in long-maturity U.S. Treasury yields was, however, more unprecedented.",

To identify the effects on firm outcomes, we construct government spending shocks at the firm level as the difference between realized and expected contract awards. We measure expectations by tracing the allocation of each dollar to firms back to appropriations bills and exploiting predictable agency-to-firm procurement shares. Firms receiving positive government spending shocks increase markups and profitability, outperform industry peers in the stock market, and gain market share, fostering rising industry stars.",

		summary: "We investigate how fuel taxation reduces climate and pollution externalities by evaluating the world’s largest environmental tax reform. Using spatially detailed emissions data from more than 1,000 European regions in a synthetic difference-in-differences framework, we evaluate the impact of Germany’s 1999 ecological tax reform on transport-related carbon and air pollutant emissions. We document sizable aggregate reductions for all emissions, exceeding 10 percent on average per year relative to synthetic baselines. Using official damage valuations, we estimate avoided external costs of more than €100 billion, two-thirds of which stem from health benefits due to reduced air pollution. Emission reductions and associated monetized benefits are larger in lower-income regions, contrasting with a slightly regressive distribution of fuel costs. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating air quality co-benefits when evaluating the efficiency and distributional effects of fuel an",

It is autobiographical as Rogoff walks through how he was engaged with many of the key topics of international finance. It was quite a run of problems: The Cold WarThe Asian currency crisisThe rise of China The issue of Japan and currency movesThe single currency in Europe All of these policy and economic issues required fundamental research to make the right choice and understand the crises being faced. Rogoff makes all of the issues approachable. The complexities are presented clearly, mixed with personal stories. If you want to understand the problems of international finance over the last few decades, you could not do better than read this book.",

However, we need to acknowledge the extreme moves in the dollar over the last six months. The reason for the dollar decline is truly self-inflicted on the part of the US.The dollar decline is not driven by systematic factors that would have been picked up by a quant model. The trend/momentum would have called for a short signal, but the exogenous factors have not been seen in past data. Growth in the US is not below the rest of the world. There is the threat of a recession, but the numbers do not suggest lower relative growth. Inflation is still higher than desired, but again the numbers do ot suggest a dollar decline. The three areas of concern are uncertainty, trade, and debt. Usually, higher uncertainty will lead to a flight toward safety, but in this case, the uncertainty is with the US. The trade and tariff issue is real, but we lack sufficient evide",

		summary: "We study whether Algorithmic Market Makers using Q-learning produce competitive or supra-competitive prices in a quote-driven asset market. We show, through simulations and analytically, that the result depends on the way the algorithm is set up. A basic Q-learning algorithm leads to loss-free prices and is, therefore, not fit for trade. Carefully choosing the exploration and learning parameters leads to less extreme prices, but still far away from the competitive ones. When we endow the algorithm with a basic understanding of the market and basic information about outstanding quotes, the Q-learning algorithms produce competitive prices.",

		summary: "How does the expansion of commodity export production impact the skill premium in a developing colonial economy? In this paper, we examine this question by relating sugar and coffee production – two key exports – to the relative wage of skilled to unskilled workers in early twentieth-century Java, Indonesia. Drawing on a newly-constructed dataset of regionally-disaggregated production figures and wages, we find a positive relationship between sugar production and the skill premium, but no relationship between coffee production and the skill premium. Using several instruments exploiting exogenous variation in global market prices and local production suitability, we find evidence for a causal effect of sugar production on the skill premium. Specifically, we estimate that a 10% increase in sugar production boosted the skill premium by about 10-11%. A substantial amount of skilled labour was involved in commodity production processes, in particular that of sugar, but there was a general s",

		summary: "Rational individuals who obtain a premium by passing an imprecise test change their choice of costly competence when the pass threshold varies. At given premium that reaction prevents variation of the failure rate completely if the marginal cost of competence is constant, only partially if it is increasing. The offsetting effect of endogenous competence is stronger when the pass premium varies in the same direction as the threshold, as it plausibly does when in equilibrium it depends on the expected competence differential between otherwise unobservably heterogeneous individuals who pass and fail. Failure rates remain very similar as different thresholds elicit different endogenous competence, and depend much more strongly on the test's precision: the outcome of a frequently failed test must be very random from the point of view of those who take it.",

We identify two key effects of AI improvement: A freeriding effect raises worker rents by increasing the probability of successful investment when the worker shirks; A capital reallocation effect shifts investment toward workers with higher or lower rents, depending on which tasks AI improves. Contrary to standard predictions, AI can raise both worker rents and labor demand. We derive implications for capital allocation, labor demand, compensation, and welfare.",

		summary: "Do trade dependencies leave countries vulnerable to geopolitical coercion? We study the economic costs of trade and financial sanctions, from 1920 to the present. We first develop a continuous measure of sanction intensity, using bilateral commodity-level data to calculate the importance of specific flows that fall under sanctions. We find that sanctions inflict relatively small costs on average: sanctioning 1% of GDP worth of imports or exports leads to approximately 0.3 percentage points of lost GDP over a 5-year period and a 0.1 percentage point increase in unemployment. However, we show that sanctions are far more costly for countries whose trade is highly concentrated, and for countries that rely heavily on exporting primary commodities. Low income and developing countries appear most vulnerable to trade sanctions, while high income financial centers and some EU countries are among the most exposed to financial sanctions.",

		summary: "Mark Carlson, Zack Saravay, and Mary TianWe examine how primary dealers utilized repo operations conducted by the Federal Reserve from September 2019 until May 2020 and how usage affected dealer borrowing and lending. Using daily dealer-level supervisory data, we find that during normal market conditions, dealers primarily used Fed repo to expand their total repo borrowing and on-lent much of this funding to a broad variety of counterparties. However, during market stress in March 2020, dealers used Fed repo as a substitute for funding from other counterparties and focused their on-lending to affiliated counterparties. Moreover, dealers with more headroom under the Supplementary Leverage Ratio requirement used more of their Fed repo borrowing to provide intermediation in funding markets. Our results underscore the critical role that the Fed's repo operations played, especially in March 2020, by reducing dealer funding stress and enabling dealers to pass on liquidity.",

This paper studies the impact of climate variability on soybean yields in Argentina using a novel department-level dataset spanning 1980 - 2023. We estimate a fixed effects spatial error model (SEM) to quantify the long-run effects of weather shocks - measured by extreme heat, precipitation, and ENSO phases - while controlling for economic and technological factors such as seed technology and relative prices.",

Shortly after the Russian attack, the projected cost (cumulative over six years) stood at $2.44 trillion for the region. Professional forecasters predicted a dramatic increase in macroeconomic uncertainty, significant spillover effects, some hysteresis effects as well as a changing nature of business cycles. We also use the war shock to study how professional forecasters acquire and process information. Our results point to state dependence as well as an important role of forward information in shaping macroeconomic outlook of professional forecasters.",

		summary: "There's something happening to the upper middle class in the United States that no one is talking about. They are going through an existential crisis. I first noticed it at the airport. A line 20 people deep for the American Express lounge. Then, once you get inside, more lines for food/drinks and not an open chair in sight. Then I saw it in the housing market. I have friends with $10,000+ monthly mortgage payments on modest homes. Ten grand a month and they still don't own a mansion. Today, buying a 3-bedroom apartment in Jersey City (where I live) would cost me anywhere from $9,300-$14,000 a month (all-in). I could rent the same unit for around $6,000-$7,000 a month. Lastly, I saw it when I went on vacation to the Bahamas. I was told that Baha Mar was the place to go. It's an expensive resort that has a waterpark, casino, and lots of dining options. The only problem? There isn't enough space for everyone to enjoy everything. If you don't book ahead, good luck getting a reservation at",

		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20465",
		summary: "As consumer and investor demand for sustainability rises, firms are expanding their portfolios to include more sustainable products. This paper investigates whether such firms, as a result, become more exposed to household income shocks. Using U.S. retail scanner data, we find that declines in household income significantly reduce the share of spending on sustainable products—especially among high-income households. These results are robust to alternative sustainability classifications and cannot be fully explained by health considerations. To help identify causal effects, we exploit exogenous variation in household income arising from the timing of tax rebate disbursements under the 2008 Economic Stimulus Payments program. A structural demand model indicates that the effect is driven by both high-income consumers’ lower price sensitivity and a stronger preference for sustainable products, irrespective of price. Our findings suggest that firms focusing on sustainable offerings may face",

		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20464",
		summary: "We study the dividend payouts of U.S. banks during the 2008 financial crisis. We show that banks with a higher share of short term liabilities to total liabilities, which were thus more exposed to the 2008 rollover crisis, increased their dividend payouts relative to less exposed banks. This relative increase in dividend payouts is concentrated in relatively cash-rich banks and is not driven by other systematic differences in bank asset portfolios across broad asset classes. The relative dividend payout increase was associated with a short-run increase in stock valuations and a decrease in short-term bond yields, as well as credit default swap premia. We argue that these empirical facts are consistent with a ”dividend signaling channel”, whereby dividend payouts impact the coordination problem and rollover decisions of short-term lenders.",

		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20466",
		summary: "This paper offers practical advice on how to improve statistical power in randomized experiments through choices and actions researchers can take at the design, implementation, and analysis stages. At the design stage, the choice of estimand, choice of treatment, and decisions that affect the residual variance and intra-cluster correlation can all affect power for a given sample size. At the implementation stage, researchers can boost power through increasing compliance with treatment, reducing attrition, and improving outcome measurement. At the analysis stage, power can be increased through using different test statistics or estimands, through the choice of control variables, and through incorporating informative priors in a Bayesian analysis. A key message is that it does not make sense to talk of “the” power of an experiment. A study can be well-powered for one outcome or estimand, but not others, and a fixed sample size can yield very different levels of power depending on researc",

Men with grief-lined faces sat in front of Mickey Mouse reliquaries, mini princess figurines arranged in rainbow tiers on top of metal cabinets. Inspirational wall art, printed on polyethylene panels, read P.S. You Got This and One Small Thought in the Morning Can Change Your Whole Day. The decor raised the possibility that the fixations of the Disney adult are a direct response to conditions of oppression—oppression in which the Disney adult is complicit.",

		summary: "- by New Deal democratIndustrial production is much less central to the US economic picture than it was before the “China shock,” since so much production moved overseas, meaning US consumers buy much more imported goods than they used to.Still it is an important if diminished coincident indicator. This morning’s report for June was positive, but less so than appeared on the surface.Headline industrial production (blue in the graph below) increased 0.3% for the month. It is higher by 0.7% than it was one year ago, and 0.5% higher than it was in September 2022, its former post-pandemic high. Manufacturing production (red) increased 0.1% and is 1.0% higher than one year ago, but -0.1% lower than its post-pandemic high of October 2022:What’s the difference? As has been the case a number of times in the past year, utilities production (blue in the graph below), and specifically electrical utilities (red):I strongly suspect this is due to the necessity to generate power for mining crypto - ",

		summary: "- by New Deal democratMuch of the commentary on yesterday’s CPI report suggested that the tariff impacts were apparent. My own analysis was more cautious. That’s simply because we don’t know for sure which items were affected by tariffs, and at this point referring to, e.g., appliances that showed relatively large monthly increases in prices is speculative - not wrong, mind you, simply speculative. The closest to rigorous analysis I read was that goods inflation was more than services inflation, which would make sense because few “services” can be imported.That issue continued into this morning’s report on June producer prices.Headline PPI was reported this morning to have been unchanged for June, while that for raw commodities increased 0.6%. Still, as shown by the below, the YoY trend in each is hardly that of accelerating inflation. Final demand PPI was up 2.4% YoY, continuing its cooling trend, while that for commodities was up 1.7%, in line with its trend for the past 12 months:Wh",

		summary: "Cody KallenRising geopolitical tensions and supply chain vulnerabilities have driven recent fragmentation of foreign direct investment (FDI). This paper provides systematic evidence of FDI fragmentation along ideological and geographic lines across five dimensions: shifting away from ideologically distant countries (ideological sorting), prioritizing politically aligned countries (friendshoring), reducing exposure to specific high-risk countries (derisking), moving production closer to the home country (nearshoring), and returning investment to the home country (reshoring). Measures of FDI based on financial transactions reveal evidence of ideological sorting and nearshoring. The capital expenditures of multinational enterprises and their affiliates display ideological sorting, derisking, nearshoring, and reshoring. Cross-border M&A deals reflect patterns of derisking, while horizontal (but not vertical) M&A exhibits broader ideological realignment. At the industry level, derisking and",

		summary: "This paper provides empirical evidence on which M&A deals spur innovation, and which stifle it. To do so, we consider not only the product market position of the acquiring firm, but also the position of both target and acquirer in the technology space. Focusing on the antidiabetic drugs market, our dataset tracks the lifecycle and patenting of all individual antidiabetic projects in development between 1997 and 2017. We show that most terminations of acquired projects occur while the projects are still far from product market entry. Nevertheless, a number of these early-stage acquisitions have a positive impact on innovation. These cases arise when incumbents acquire projects close to their own projects in product markets, but only if these projects are also close in technology markets. Those deals are associated with increased subsequent patenting, which is consistent with the exploitation of technological synergies. Our results point to the crucial role of combining both product mark",

		summary: "One in nine workers worldwide experiences a non-fatal occupational accident, with nearly 750,000 French workers missing multiple workdays due to work-related injuries in 2003 alone. As multinational firms emphasize their superior management practices and ESG commitments, this study investigates whether foreign ownership enhances workplace safety. Using detailed plant-level data from France (2003–2017) and applying recent event study techniques to the full data as well as a matched sample, it finds that foreign acquisitions improve worker safety by reducing accident rates, the proportion of injured employees, and the share of lost workdays. These benefits are primarily driven by a decline in major accidents among blue-collar workers. The safety improvements coincide with post-acquisition organisational changes within the plant and the firm, including a higher ratio of hours worked by technical middle managers relative to blue-collar workers, an increase in organisational layers, a great",

The results show that temperature uncertainty—by increasing power outages, reducing labor productivity, and increasing the degree of exposure of firms to environmental and non-political risks, as well as economic uncertainty at the firm-level—persistently reduce firms’ investment and sales. This effect varies across firms, with those characterized by tighter financial constraints being disproportionally more affected.",

		summary: "Under inflation forecast targeting, central banks such as the ECB adjust policy to keep expected inflation on target. We evaluate the ECB’s inflation forecasts: they are unbiased and efficient but contain little information at forecast horizons beyond three quarters. In a New Keynesian model with transmission lags, inflation forecast targeting is indeed effective in stabilizing inflation—provided there is no forward-looking behavior—though the information content of forecasts is unrealistically high. In the presence of forward-looking behavior, the information content declines because monetary policy becomes more effective in meeting the target, but inflation is best stabilized by targeting current inflation.",

		summary: "This paper examines the impact of economic sanctions on the choice of invoicing currencies in international trade, focusing on the sanctions imposed on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Using transaction-level data on Russia’s imports from 2016 to 2023, we document a significant shift away from US dollar (USD) invoicing toward increased use of the Chinese renminbi (CNY), particularly in trade with China and other neutral economies. By the second half of 2023, the CNY accounted for over a third of Russia’s import value, up from less than 4 percent in 2021. Employing a difference-in-difference approach, we identify several mechanisms driving this shift: geopolitical alignment, financial infrastructure such as currency swap lines with the People’s Bank of China, the threat of secondary sanctions, and rising transaction costs in Western currencies. Strategic complementarities and the exit of Western firms further accelerated this currency switching. Our ",

The effect of the technology on the innovation process is a crucial open question. Some inventions, such as the light bulb, temporarily raise productivity growth as adoption spreads, but the effect fades when the market is saturated; that is, the level of output per hour is permanently higher but the growth rate is not. In contrast, two types of technologies stand out as having longer-lived effects on productivity growth. First, there are technologies known as general-purpose technologies (GPTs). GPTs (1) are widely adopted, (2) spur abundant knock-on innovations (new goods and services, process efficiencies, and business reorganization), and (3) show continual improvement, refreshing this innovation cycle; the electric dynamo is an example.",

Contrary to the general theme of deceleration which has been the case for several years now, initial claims appear to be breaking trend in the positive direction.Specifically, initial claims declined -7,000 last week to 221,000, their lowest reading since the end of March. The four week moving average declined -6,250 to 229,500, the lowest since the beginning of May. With the typical one week delay, continuing claims rose 2,000 to 1.956 million:On the YoY% basis more useful for forecasting, initial claims were down -7.9%, and the four week average down -1.6%, only the 3rd time in the past 10 months that this comparison has been lower, and the biggest YoY decline during that time. Only continuing claims remained higher, by 4.8%:This tells us that there are very few layoffs, even if those who are laid off are having a more difficult time landing a new job.

		fullContent: "Key Insights Data center operators are ready to invest in efficient, flexible, and low-cost energy sources that can mitigate stranded asset risks for utilities and keep ratepayer costs in check. Data centers use just 2% of global electricity today. Electricity demand growth from data centers is projected to be less than industrial operations, electric vehicles, household appliances, and space cooling over the next 5 years. Many utilities, specifically in the United States, have a track record of over-forecasting demand, spending billions of dollars building power plants for load that did not materialize. This risk is more salient today given the unpredictability of data center load growth. A range of energy solutions for data centers —  including energy efficiency, flexibility technologies, and fast, modular, and low-cost energy sources — can temper the risks of over-building and high ratepayer costs. These solutions are already the most attractive options for data center operators tod",

		summary: "Attitudes toward fiscal policy differ: \"fiscal conservatism\" and \"fiscal liberalism\" vary in their willingness to tolerate budget deficits. We challenge the view that such attitudes reflect national preferences. Instead, we offer an economic explanation based on a two-country Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian model, bringing its implicit political economy dimension to the forefront. We compute the welfare implications of alternative fiscal policies at the household level to assess the conditions under which a policy commands majority support. Whether the majority supports fiscal conservatism or liberalism depends on a country’s debt level, its wealth distribution, and the nature of the economic shock.",

		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20474",
		summary: "Seven decades ago, Simon Kuznets put forward the hypothesis that as economies developed, national inequality would first increase and then decrease—an inverted U-shape. He provided preliminary evidence for the hypothesis on the basis of the limited data available at the time, and theorized the genesis of the curve as arising from the twin forces of structural transformation of the economy and political economy pressures. Seven decades on, the Kuznets curve still has a hold on the development discourse as new data is used to test the hypothesis, new theories are elaborated to explain the evolution of inequality, and the metaphor of an inverse U-shape is extended beyond its original realm of national inequality. With this rich history and background, the time is right to examine the Kuznets curve literature broadly construed. This overview takes stock of what has been learned and highlights emerging research and policy questions.",

		summary: "Despite the formal end of Apartheid in 1994, South Africa remains one of the most unequal countries in the world. This paper investigates the mechanisms behind this persistence of inequality by developing a spatial dynastic model with heterogeneous agents, incomplete markets, and endogenous choices over education, occupation, savings, and location. Drawing on newly assembled micro-geographic data, we document a shift in inequality from being primarily across races to increasingly within the Black population, with spatial segregation — especially the legacy of Townships — playing a key role. Our model, disciplined by detailed spatial and socioeconomic data, captures the slow intergenerational convergence in education and occupational outcomes observed in post-Apartheid South Africa. It shows how inherited spatial disadvantages — through high commuting costs, disparities in school quality, and limited access to credit — continue to shape households’ educational, occupational, and locatio",

The first is the role that cash holdings play in a business, an extension of the dividend policy question, with an examination of why businesses often should not pay out what they have available to shareholders. In my classes and writing on corporate finance, I look at the motives for businesses retaining cash, as well as how much cash is too much cash. The second is bitcoin, which can be viewed as either a currency or a collectible, and in a series of posts, I argued that bitcoin can only be priced, not valued, making debates about whether to buy or not to buy entirely a function of perception. In fact, I have steered away from saying much about bitcoin in recent years, though I did mention it in my post on alternative investments as a collectible (like gold) that can be added to the choice mix.

This morning’s report on housing permits, starts, and construction continues the trend that has been in place for several years.For the month, permits (gold in the graph below) increased 3,000 to 1.397 annualized, while the more noisy starts (blue) increased 58,000 to 1.321 annualized. But both of these are still very close to their post-pandemic lows. But the metric that is the least noisy of all and conveys the most signal, single family starts (red), decreased 33,000 to 866,000 annualized:In the above graph, I normalized permits and single family permits to 100 as of their post-pandemic peaks. I did the same for starts, but used their peak three month average. Starts are down 23.9% from their peak, permits 27.2%, and single family permits 30.3%. Is this sufficient to be recessionary?

Its direct exposure to new US tariffs is relatively limited, but indirect effects through slower global demand and financial conditions may be larger. Strengthening regional trade integration through initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) can help build regional supply chains and reduce reliance on commodity exports. Africa's young workforce, digital innovation and rich natural resources provide longer-term growth tailwinds. Unlocking these opportunities requires investment in skills, infrastructure and financial integration to boost trade and value-added.",

		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20476",
		summary: "Based on an estimated two-region dynamic general equilibrium model, we show that the persistent productivity growth differential between the Euro Area (EA) and rest of the world (RoW) has been a key driver of the EA trade surplus since the launch of the Euro. A secular decline in the EA’s spending home bias and a trend decrease in relative EA import prices account for the stability of the EA real exchange rate, despite slower EA output growth. By incorporating trend shocks to growth and trade, the analysis departs from much of the open-economy macroeconomics literature which has focused on stationary disturbances. Our results highlight the relevance of non-stationary shocks for the analysis of external adjustment.",

		summary: "This paper examines the relationship between green innovation and the business cycle, revealing that while non-green innovation is procyclical, green innovation is countercyclical. This pattern holds unconditionally over the business cycle and conditional on economic shocks. Motivated by these findings, we develop a business cycle model with endogenous green and non-green innovation to explain their distinct cyclical behavior. The key mechanism operates through a ‘green is in the future’ channel: green patents are expected to generate higher profits in the future, making green patenting less sensitive to short-term economic fluctuations. In general equilibrium, this channel is reinforced, making green and non-green innovation effective substitutes. We provide direct evidence supporting the model mechanism using data on market-implied values of green and non-green patents.",

		summary: "This paper studies how firms’ ownership choices and workers’ intrinsic motivation jointly shape service quality and market outcomes in labor-intensive, mission-driven sectors. Two organizations first choose whether to operate as standard for-profit or as mission-oriented firms, and then compete in both the labor and the user markets. Mission-oriented firms have higher unit costs but attract better-motivated workers. Service quality is endogenously determined through the sorting of intrinsically motivated workers and depends on the firm's ownership type. We show that all market structures — standard, mission-oriented, or mixed — can arise in equilibrium, and that mixed structures can be Pareto superior by efficiently allocating the most motivated workers to the mission-oriented firm while preserving the cost advantage of the other firm. While equilibrium outcomes generally diverge from the social optimum due to externalities and lack of coordination, they are both driven by the trade-of",

		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20479",
		summary: "This paper explores a repositioning of Europe’s labor market institutions as potential drivers of the transatlantic gap in macroeconomic performance. Institutional diagnoses were prominent in times of high European unemployment in the 1980-90s. But interest waned as joblessness fell—even though the decline was uneven, precarious work arrangements have grown, and labor markets remain largely unreformed (unlike product and financial markets). Yet, rigid labor market institutions might continue to matter because they can stifle labor market and business dynamism: Europeans switch jobs much less frequently, and restructuring is much rarer. Recent research argues that such immobility impedes wage and productivity growth. Moreover, this low dynamism might contribute to Europe’s specific underperformance in tech, R&D, disruptive innovation, ICT adoption—where creative destruction requires fluid reallocation. This institutional labor market perspective on European competitiveness complements p",

		summary: "We present new evidence on the impact of fiscal variables on long-term interest rates and term premia in the United States. To alleviate endogeneity problems, we follow the seminal methodology by Laubach (2009) and resort to long-term projections of interest rates and fiscal variables. After incorporating an additional 20 years of data into our sample, the estimated effects of debt and deficits on interest rates show little change from Laubach’s findings. However, we show that the link between long-term rates and fiscal variables is not stable over time. It was close to zero during the years of relative fiscal prudence around the turn of the century and it has been increasing since fiscal positions have started to deteriorate markedly",

		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20477",
		summary: "This paper presents micro-empirical evidence on the effects of wage-setting decentralization. Our setting is Italy, where employers are required to comply with occupation- and industry-specific wage floors set by national collective bargaining agreements. We show that opting out of these agreements reduces wages but increases workers’ employment and retention within firms. These effects are most pronounced in the more productive North, where the overall impact on workers’ earnings is slightly positive. In contrast, in the South, wage losses outweigh employment gains, leading to a net decline in earnings. We also find that increased wage-setting flexibility is associated with higher firm survival rates in both regions. The regional divergence in outcomes aligns with a monopsony framework in which productivity and labor supply elasticities vary spatially.",

So let’s take a look at two of my favorite labor indicators: real average hourly wages and real aggregate payrolls for nonsupervisory workers.First, here are real average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers:These were unchanged in June. Nominally wages increased 0.3% in June, but so did consumer inflation, so the net was zero. The upward trend in these since July 2022 (when gas prices backed off from $5/gallon due to the Ukraine war) remains intact.Here is the long term YoY% look:Real hourly wages have increased. 1.2% in the 12 months. With a few exceptions, for the past two years they have increased between 1.0% and 1.7% YoY.

In an advisory about the SharePoint security hole, a.k.a.

The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) concurred, saying CVE-2025-53770 is a variant on a flaw Microsoft patched earlier this month (CVE-2025-49706). Microsoft notes the weakness applies only to SharePoint Servers that organizations use in-house, and that SharePoint Online and Microsoft 365 are not affected. The Washington Pos",

		summary: "Globalization offers unparalleled opportunities to expand welfare through cooperation across large networks of unrelated individuals. Social exclusion – permanent or temporary – and monetary exchange are institutions that in theory can incentivize cooperation. In an experiment, we evaluate their relative performance and interaction in anonymous networks of different sizes. Permanent social exclusion (ostracism) reduces long-run economic potential by leading to sparse networks. Monetary exchange and temporary social exclusion perform similarly well in small networks. In large networks, however, monetary exchange is the only institution that promotes full cooperation by crowding out ostracism and keeping the network complete. An insight is that monetary systems outperform social exclusion mechanisms in promoting cooperation in globalized social and economic networks.",

		summary: "The majority of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China were privatized through ownership reforms over the last three decades. Using a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enterprises in China between 1998 and 2013, we show that privatized SOEs continue to benefit from government support relative to private enterprises. Compared to private firms that were never state-owned, privatized SOEs are favored by lower interest loans and higher government subsidies. Moreover, both SOEs and privatized SOEs significantly underperform relative to private firms, despite some improvements post-privatization. An exception is in improvements in productivity growth, where former SOEs match or exceed their private sector counterparts–results consistent with recent research.

		summary: "We prove the existence of a Markov-perfect equilibrium in randomized stopping times for a model of the war of attrition in which the underlying state variable follows a homogenous linear diffusion. We first prove that the space of Markovian randomized stopping times can be topologized as a compact absolute retract. This in turn enables us to use a powerful fixed-point theorem by Eilenberg and Montgomery to prove our existence theorem. We illustrate our results with an example of a war of attrition that admits a mixed-strategy Markov-perfect equilibrium but no pure-strategy Markov-perfect equilibrium.",

		summary: "Students may hold stereotyped beliefs about subjects that distort subject choices. For example, economics is believed to be about money, not inequality or well-being, and this perception may attract some students to the subject, while deterring others. We report results from a UK-wide high school outreach program in which undergraduate champions delivered economics taster sessions to 5,000+ students. The sessions increase students’ reported likelihood of studying economics by ~20 per cent. We shed light on what drives this increase. The sessions broaden students’ understanding of what economics is about and this accounts for ~20 per cent of the increased likelihood. The sessions also change students’ beliefs about (different attributes of) studying economics. The most important drivers of the increased likelihood are students’ increased beliefs that they will do well in economics and that they will enjoy studying the subject.",

Members of the public were asked for their opinions on topical issues and shown the opinion of either a male or a female economist, all professors at leading US universities. We find, first, that experts can persuade members of the public – the opinions of individual expert economists have an effect on public opinion – and, second, that the opinions expressed by female economists are more persuasive than the same opinions expressed by male economists.",

		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20482",
		summary: "Administrative barriers to trade such as customs procedures are well-documented sources of delays and costs in cross-border commerce, often prompting firms to outsource these tasks to specialist customs agents. This paper examines the role of customs agents in a key global trade facilitation policy—the Authorized Economic Operator Mutual Recognition Agreement (AEO-MRA)—which enables certified traders to benefit from simplified customs procedures with partner countries. Focusing on the 2012 EU-US AEO-MRA, and using UK transaction-level customs data from HMRC that uniquely identify the AEO status of agents filing on behalf of firms, we document the widespread use of customs agents in UK exports. Guided by a theoretical framework, we show that non-certified firms benefited indirectly from the policy through certified agents, leading to more US market entry, fewer product exits, and higher export values. These findings highlight the role of intermediaries in extending the reach of trade fa",

		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20487",
		summary: "Using a large and representative panel of U.S. brokerage accounts, we show that retail investors trade as contrarians after large earnings surprises, especially for loser stocks, and that such contrarian trading contributes to price momentum and post earnings announcement drift (PEAD). We show that extreme return streaks and surprises are not enough for stocks to exhibit PEAD and momentum and that the intensity of contrarian retail trading plays a key role: the PEAD of loser stocks with bad earnings surprises becomes increasingly more negative as retail buying pressure increases, and he PEAD of the stocks with the highest past returns and largest earnings surprises is the most positive for the stocks with the biggest net retail outflow. Finer sorts confirm the results, as do sorts by firm size and institutional ownership level. Younger and more attentive individuals are more likely to be contrarian, and a firm’s dividend yield, leverage, size, book to market, and analyst coverage are a",

		summary: "- by New Deal democratNew economic data will resume tomorrow. Since I haven’t updated the impact of Tariff-palooza! on transport and spending in awhile, let’s take a look at that.The “tip of the spear” is container shipping. Here’s a graph of traffic at the busiest ports in the US, from CNBC:At the busiest ports, the steep decline this spring after a period of front-running is evident. In the past few weeks, there has been a rebound, doubtless in part caused by the TACO delay in tariff implementation. With the current “Liberation Day 2.0” set for August 1, a similar dynamic may well be in play.Once containers arrive in the US, they are typically shipped long distances by rail. Here is the historical record of monthly intermodal volumes through June, measured YoY to deal with seasonality:Again, the slowdown this spring is apparent.Here is a weekly close-up of the past year:Much like shipping traffic, there has been a rebound so far in July, which may very well represent front-running th",

		summary: "PremiaLab Research has issued a new paper titled \"Navigating Market Shifts with QIS Trend and Momentum Strategies,\" which analyzes trend and momentum behavior in 2025 and the last five years using their pure factor models. First, trend-following has not performed well across all major asset classes; however, an equity cross-sectional momentum approach did very well. The directional changes associated with the high uncertainty in 20205 have hurt those following trends. Trend-following is a pure directional strategy, while a momentum strategy focuses on relative movement to create a long/short portfolio.Over the longer term, equity momentum continues to perform well, but there were also substantial gains focused on short-term interest rates. Clearly, there are no exploitable trends in all assets, and the secret to good trend-following is to balance exposures across all asset classes.",

		summary: "We study monetary policy where the price and wage Phillips curves exhibit true curvature. To this end, we propose a New Keynesian (NK) model featuring endogenous adjustment of price and wage setting frequencies, moving beyond the quasi-linear structure of the standard nonlinear NK Phillips curves (NKPC). Using euro area data spanning 1999Q1 to 2024Q4, we estimate and simulate the non-linear model. We then study the recent inflation surge and the implications of state-dependent prices and wages for monetary policy in the estimated non-linear model. Unlike conventional models, our framework does not primarily explain inflation dynamics by exogenous supply shocks. Instead, the impact of shocks on inflation depends on their timing, size, and the business cycle. Consequently, the inflation-output stabilization trade-off faced by monetary policy is state-dependent. For example, monetary policy is more effective in curbing inflation, and supply shocks have larger effects during periods of hig",

		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20488",
		summary: "This paper examines long-run unconditional convergence of labour productivity in manufacturing across 48 contiguous U.S. states. We construct a detailed panel data set of state-industry pairs with over 120 industries covering the period 1880-2007. The remarkable finding is a rapid rate of unconditional β-convergence: 7.6% per year in the period 1880-2007, and about 6.5% in each period 1880-1940 and 1958-2007. We also find a steep rise in unconditional convergence from 5.5% in 1930-1940 to 10.6% in 1940-1947 and 9.4% in 1947-1958, followed by a considerable drop thereafter. In the years 1958-2007, the rate of convergence in ICT industries (8.3%) is higher than in 1st-Industrial-Revolution (6.3%) or 2nd-Industrial-Revolution (7.0%) industries. We interpret our results as a process of technological catch up between initially laggard Southern manufacturing and manufacturing industries in the North.",

However, inquiries into new projects increased for the second consecutive month and grew at the strongest pace since last fall. This means that clients are starting to send out RFPs and initiate conversations with architecture firms about potential projects after a lull since mid-winter. However, these inquiries do not necessarily translate into actual projects, as the value of newly signed design contracts declined for the 16th consecutive month in June. It is unlikely that firm billings will return to positive territory until the value of new design contracts also starts to increase again. Business conditions remained gene",

(NYSE:ICE) ... today released its June 2025 ICE First Look, which shows that while overall mortgage payment performance remains strong, delinquencies rose on a monthly basis while foreclosures trended notably higher year over year (YoY). Key takeaways from the ICE First Look, which reports on month-end delinquency, foreclosure and prepayment statistics sourced from ICE’s loan-level database, include: • The national delinquency rate rose by 15 basis points (bps) from May to 3.35% driven by early-stage delinquencies. FHA delinquencies, which tend to experience more seasonality, rose by 41 bps in the month, hitting their highest June level since 2013, excluding the 2020-2021 pandemic-era impact. • Serious delinquencies (SDQs) – loans 90+ days past due but not in foreclosure – held",

This complicates the story of rebalancing between new and existing homes.To recapitulate, while new home sales are the most leading measure of the housing market, they are very noisy and heavily revised, which is why I generally pay more attention to single family permits. Still, if averaged over three or more months they are valuable indicators of the underlying upward or downward pressure on the economy going forward one year or more. Let me begin also with a periodic reminder that sales lead prices:As well as leading inventory:Here is the YoY% change post-pandemic of all three:As per history, sales rose first, followed by prices and inventory. Sales then abated, and median prices have since turned down, although inventory has not yet done so.Turning to each metric in order …. With mort",

If you can crack the holy grail of what drivers the major asset classes, you will be in a great position to manage any diversified stock bond portfolio. We know that the corrrelaiton between these two assets follows wide regime changes from positive to negative and then back again, so it is critical to find the key relationships. The recent CFA Institute brief, \"Macroeconomic Drivers of Stocks and Bonds,\" utilizes an extensive dataset of macroeconomic variables to identify the key drivers. The focus of the paper is on factor selection using LASSO regression, which facilitates the stability selection of variables, and out-of-sample random forest regressions to enhance the prediction of key variables. The brief finds that LASSO regression can help narrow the set of factors used in finding these key relationships, and the use of random forests can lead to a significant reduction",

It is fair to say that this week’s report supplied that evidence.Initial claims declilned another -4,000 to 217,000, the lowest weekly number since mid-April. The four week average declined -5,000 to 214,500, also the lowest such number since mid-April. Contrarily, with the typical one week delay continuing claims rose 4,000 to 1.955 million, close to its 3.5 year high set four week ago:On the more important for forecasting YoY basis, initial claims were down -8.1%, and the four week average down -4.1%. Only continuing claims were higher, by 5.5%:Initial claims are squarely in the middle of their range over the past 3.5 years, suggesting that very few people are getting laid off.

		summary: "We use quasi-random local variation in the number of young men who died as a result of World War I to estimate the impact of this demographic shock on innovation and structural change in France. Our analysis shows that excess mortality led to an increase in patenting activity in counties with high pre-war education levels, driven predominantly by innovations in labor-saving technologies. Our estimates imply that an additional 6,000 patents were filed in the 15 years following the war, amounting roughly to the average annual number of patents filed pre-war. We find a positive association between war-related mortality and wage growth as well as with the adoption of machines in the agricultural sector, providing additional evidence that incentives to escape labor scarcity are driving the innovation response to mortality.",

This chapter develops a framework whose goal is to survey and synthesize the answers that regional and urban economists have given to this question. Emphasis is placed on theoretical results about sufficient statistics that capture approximate impacts in both distorted and undistorted economies, as well as how new advances in data collection and causal inference are poised to leverage these theoretical results and thereby modernize and extend standard templates for infrastructure and policy evaluation. The chapter concludes with discussions of optimal policy, political economy, and practical matters of infrastructure provision.",

		summary: "Competition authorities increasingly rely on economic screening tools to identify markets where firms deviate from competitive norms. Traditional screening methods assume that collusion occurs through secret agreements. However, recent research highlights that firms can use public announcements to coordinate decisions, reducing competition while avoiding detection. We propose a novel approach to screening for collusion in public corporate statements. Using natural language processing, we analyze more than 300,000 earnings call transcripts issued worldwide between 2004 and 2022. By identifying expressions commonly associated with collusion, our method provides competition authorities with a tool to detect potentially anticompetitive behavior in public communications. Our approach can extend beyond earnings calls to other sources, such as news articles, trade press, and industry reports. Our method informed the European Commission’s 2024 unannounced inspections in the car tire sector, pr",

		summary: "This handbook chapter provides a synthesis of the literature on armed conflicts, with a special focus on development economics, while covering also other disciplines. The piece starts off with a discussion of the main consequences of conflict before investigating its root causes. First, a series of theoretical approaches and results will be reviewed, before presenting major datasets and methods. As a next step, a structured analysis of key empirical findings follows. The last part of the handbook chapter is devoted to a synthesis of crucial policy lessons.",

		title: "DP20492 Escaping Labor Scarcity: Innovation and Human Capital after WW1 in France",
		url: "https://cepr.org/publications/dp20492",
		summary: "We use quasi-random local variation in the number of young men who died as a result of World War I to estimate the impact of this demographic shock on innovation and structural change in France. Our analysis shows that excess mortality led to an increase in patenting activity in counties with high pre-war education levels, driven predominantly by innovations in labor-saving technologies. Our estimates imply that an additional 6,000 patents were filed in the 15 years following the war, amounting roughly to the average annual number of patents filed pre-war. We find a positive association between war-related mortality and wage growth as well as with the adoption of machines in the agricultural sector, providing additional evidence that incentives to escape labor scarcity are driving the innovation response to mortality.",

		summary: "- by New Deal democratThere was no big economic news today, despite the report on durable goods, which declined -9.3% in June — after a 16.5% advance in May. Simply put, it was all about aircraft orders from Boeing. Take out transportation, and orders rose 0.6% in May and 0.2% in June. The more important core capital goods number declined -0.7% after a 2.0% increase in May. Even more fundamentally, in addition to being very noisy (see above), sometimes durable goods orders lead, and sometimes they don’t. So I don’t normally pay much attention to them.But what I do pay a lot of attention to is consumer spending, and today I want to address variations on a graph I have seen in various places in the past few weeks. Below is a graph of real retail sales, total real personal consumption, and real personal consumption on goods, all normed to 100 as of last December:It doesn’t take a genius to see that these are all trending sideways or down since then.

This is the final look at local markets in June. There were several key stories for June: • Sales NSA are down 1.5% year-over-year (YoY) through June compared to the same period in 2024, and sales last year were the lowest since 1995! The YoY comparisons will be fairly easy for the next three months, so sales in 2025 might be close to the level in 2024. • Sales SA were down or unchanged YoY for the 5th consecutive month and have been down YoY for 41 of the last 46 months. • Months-of-supply is at the highest level since 2016. • The median price is barely up YoY, and with the increases in inventory, some regional areas will see more price declines - and we might see national p",

		summary: "Earlier this week, Chevron completed its acquisition of Hess Corp. It was one of the largest deals in the oil and gas space in recent history, after Exxon’s takeover of Pioneer Natural Resources, finalized in 2024. With that out of the way, the question begs to be asked: could the two U.S. giants strike a deal to create a single, much bigger giant? Some argue it might only be a matter of time.

The program increased earnings and job stability for men, especially in jobs requiring complex matching, suggesting improved match quality, but had no positive impact on women's earnings and reduced their employment. Gender differences cannot be explained by observable characteristics or differential compliance but appear to derive from treated women's increased reservation wages and lower returns to online search tools.",

The designation, issued by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on July 25 under counterterrorism authorities, blocks all property and interests of the group within U.S. jurisdiction, and generally prohibits Americans from engaging in transactions with it. “Today’s action further exposes the illegitimate Maduro regime’s facilitation of narco-terrorism through terrorist groups like Cartel de los Soles,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. “The Treasury Department will continue to execute on President [Donald] Trump’s pledge to",

		summary: "One of the key challenges for any quantitative modeler is selecting the appropriate modeling technique. This involves not selecting the features or predictors to be included in the model, but rather the statistical techniques that will generate the best predictions. Not all modeling approaches are the same, so knowing when to use the best techniques is an important skill. The paper \"From OLS to neural nets: Comparing regression models in systematic trading\" is not the final word on this question. Still, it does a good job of making comparisons across techniques. It does not address all the machine learning techniques, yet it does compare many of the simple techniques that most researchers may employ. The tables from the paper are nice to have handy for anyone starting out when thinking about modeling.",

		summary: "Over the past couple of years, China has become the world’s largest importer of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), surpassing Japan as the top buyer of super-chilled gas since 2021. China’s surging LNG imports have been shaping Asian energy flows, with the country accounting for more than 40% of the continent's total LNG import growth. However, China’s dominance in LNG markets now appears in jeopardy, and we are seeing a prolonged decline in imports. According to ship-tracking data by Kpler via Bloomberg, China’s LNG imports are…",

		summary: "We study an intervention by a brokerage firm providing advisory services to high-net- worth investors. In 2018, the firm changed the information displayed on its internal platform, so that financial advisors could no longer observe which clients’ holdings were in paper gain or loss. Using data on portfolio stock transactions between 2016 and 2021, we show that, while all investors exhibit a significant disposition effect before 2018, i.e., a greater propensity to realize gains than losses, highly-advised investors see their bias significantly reduced afterward. Our paper shows that by appropriately manipulating advisors’ information, financial firms can successfully reduce their clients’ biases.",

		summary: "Governments have a long history of regulating entrepreneurs’ use of limited liability by mandating a minimum amount of paid-in equity. While opponents argue that these requirements pose an unnecessary barrier to entrepreneurship, proponents maintain that they protect stakeholders, in part by screening out low-quality entrepreneurship. We exploit a 2012 Norwegian reform that lowered the capital requirement from $17,000 to $5,000 to study this quantity-quality trade-off. Our setting includes detailed data on both firms and the underlying entrepreneurs, providing comprehensive proxies for entrepreneurial quality. We first show that incorporation rates double after the reform and remain elevated over time. Post-reform entrants are considerably smaller in terms of assets and revenues but do not differ in terms of growth, survival rates, profitability, productivity, or leverage. Furthermore, post-reform entrants have similar past income levels, age, and educational attainment as pre-reform e",

Acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea accused Beijing of covertly aiding Moscow's military machine, and urged China to \"stop fueling Russia’s aggression\" in Ukraine. Washington has long suspected Beijing of intentionally shipping dual civilian-military goods in order to prop up Russia's defense industrial sector. \"Beijing’s claim to have implemented strong export controls on dual-use goods falls apart in the face of daily recovery of Chinese-produced components in the drones, weapons, and vehicles that Russia uses against Ukraine,\" Ambassador Shea said.

The divestitures coincide with a new report suggesting he's mulling over a potential acquisition of CNBC. According to Bloomberg data, Bezos has been on a selling spree since late June, capitalizing on Amazon's stock rebound from its April lows. So far, the sales have generated $5.7 billion for the billionaire. Here's more from the Bloomberg report: The sales, which began when Bezos unloaded $737 million around his weekend nuptials in Venice, were part of a trading plan for up to 25 million shares that he adopted earlier this year. He sold the last of the 25 million on Wednesday and Thursday, divesting about 4.2 million shares for $954 million, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Friday. Amid Bezos' dumping of stock under the 10b5-1 plan, a new report emerged last week from The New York Pos",

A Chinese hydrology expert has described the project as outright illegal, pointing out that it violates multiple international agreements and China’s environmental laws. The estimated $167 billion project, formally known as the Motuo Hydropower Station, is situated on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. It is set to become the world’s largest hydroelectric dam, with a projected annual output of 300 billion kilowatt-hours. On July 19, Chinese Premier Li Qiang attended the groundbreaking ceremony, referring to it as the “project of the century,” according to Chinese state media.

Does this spell game-over and victory for Putin and Russia? The following is a very rare admission from the hard news pages of The New York Times: James Wasserstrom, an American anticorruption expert, said in an interview that “the luster is definitely coming off” Mr. Zelensky’s wartime leadership among governments providing financial assistance. He added, “There is exasperation at Zelensky in the donor community.” Early last week, there were unexpected images coming from Kiev of the largest demonstrations against the Ukrainian government since Russia invaded more than three years ago, as more than 2,000 people gathered near the president's office, shouting \"shame\" and \"veto the law,\" after President Zelensky signed a law gutting the country's anti-corruption agency.

Under the UK’s Terrorism Act of 2000, it is now illegal to fund, support, or even publicly approve of the organization. Arrests have already begun, sparking backlash from critics, who describe cracking down on pro-Palestine Action protests as “dystopian.” Now, Palestine Action’s U.S. wing, “Unity of Fields” (UoF) faces similar scrutiny for similar behavior, including calling for police to be set on fire, cheering the murder of Israeli-Americans, traveling to Iran and publicly supporting them against the U.S., and advocating for “direct action” tactics including vandalism, violence, and full-blown terrorism. The question is: Should the U.S. follow the UK’s lead and formally ban UoF and similar extremist groups? That decision rests with lawmakers. Before discus",

The pact comes less than a week before a Friday deadline for President Donald Trump’s higher tariffs to take effect on August 1. The president in May threatened to impose a 50% duty on nearly all EU goods, adding pressure that accelerated negotiations, before lowering that to 30%. Trump made the announcement at Trump Turnberry, his seaside golf resort in western Scotland, after meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who leads the EU’s executive body. 🚨BREAKING: President Trump lands EU trade deal: - EU to purchase $750 billion in US and invest $600 billion in US - EU to purchase a “vast amount” of military equipment - EU opens up markets ",

President Trump’s signature piece of legislation allocated $3.3 billion to the DOJ, some of which will go toward the Byrne-JAG Grant Program, a federal initiative created in 2005 which provides support for local law enforcement and criminal justice efforts. To access the new funds, which supplement the $499 million already appropriated for the Byrne-JAG program in 2025, localities must comply with a section of federal immigration law that forbids them from restricting communication between their law enforcement entities and the Department of Homeland Security regarding an individual’s immigration status. This provides an incentive for localities to share thei",

		summary: "UK's Starmer Organizing Renewed Food Air Drops Over Starving Gaza Efforts of Western and some Mideast regional countries like Jordan to alleviate famine in Gaza largely failed during initial airdrops over the Strip which occurred in 2024. Food and medicine air drops proved more dangerous than conventional delivery utilizing trucks crossing land routes, as in some instances large aid crates fell on make-shift homes and tents, crushing and at times injuring or killing people. There were also instances of drowning as aid was dropped into the sea during the 2024 efforts. For example a single day in March of last year saw 18 people die trying to desperately access the aid. But given that at this point scores of people are dying each day from hunger, air drops are increasingly a risk everyone (or Western countries) is willing to take - even as Israel's military is still exercising a tight grip on what aid is allowed into Gaza and who distributes it. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is amo",

Around the world, nuclear fission is gaining traction as a critical piece of the puzzle for maintaining energy security while also slashing greenhouse gas emissions.

Meanwhile, T.J.Muscaro reports for The Epoch Times that Munson Healthcare posted on social media that 11 people were being treated at a hospital in northern Michigan, and a spokeswoman further said that all 11 were stabbing victims. Spokesperson Megan Brown said late Saturday that six were in critical condition and five were in serious condition. The Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office later said in a statement on social media that the suspect was a 42-year-old man who entered the store around 4:45 p.m. A sheriff’s deputy arrived within minutes of the suspect drawing his knife. He was taken into custody, and people in the store also helped apprehend the suspect and treat victims, ",

The house raid came while Bystron was in Washington D.C., meeting with Trump officials, including congressmen and allies of President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance. On early Tuesday morning, German police searched an older warehouse where Bystron conducted business a decade ago. “This is targeted terror against the opposition,” Bystron said in a press release. “There is no other way to classify the absurd behavior of the authorities.” Bystron was the target of Czech intelligence services last year, who decided to release a variety of allegations surrounding their investigation at a rather opportune time—right before EU parliamentary elections.

Most FOMC participants likely view this meeting as a placeholder. The balance of risks remains the same as in June: to the upside on inflation and to the downside on the labor market. The Fed will have a lot more information on how these risks have evolved by the September meeting. ... August’s Jackson Hole Symposium further reduces the urgency to guide markets next week. The Fed will have an additional month’s worth of data by then. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that Powell used his Jackson Hole speech last year to signal the 50bp cut in September.

Thematic investing is presented in a model framework in the new paper, \"Thematic Investing: A Risk-based Perspective\". In the paper, the authors cite several definitions: “Themes are structural trends expected to significantly impact economies and redefine business models.” .... “Thematic investing can be seen as an additional dimension in portfolios.” and  “.... themes may pertain to macroeconomic or structural trends that transcend the traditional business cycle.” More formally, their model looks at the residuals for a set of assets. Cross-sectionally, these residuals should be uncorrelated after accounting for their main factors. In the case of a theme, there should be positive pairwise correlation across the set of assets identified in a theme. There is a relationship that cannot be accounted for by other known factors.

		fullContent: "Here is an NBER paper from May that I do not think I covered: We evaluate the aggregate effects of a change in tariffs on the US and world economies when tariff revenue is used to enact fiscal reform. Our model combines a standard international model of fiscal policy with taxes and a dynamic model of trade participation and tariffs that allows for uncertainty and transitions. We consider effects of permanent and temporary tariffs–with and without retaliation–when tariff revenue is used to reduce taxes on capital or labor or to subsidize investment. Compared to a lump sum redistribution, using tariff revenue for these reforms always boosts economic activity. Key to our analysis is the effect of trade dynamics on import substitution, such that tariff revenue after an increase in tariffs is higher in the short run than in the long run. When increasing the tariff by 20 percentage points, the revenue raised is largest when tariffs are temporary, unilateral, and used to subsidize investment,",
